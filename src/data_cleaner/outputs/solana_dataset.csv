2020-04-23,0.685347169644,0.698077000278,0.600321839105,We are working on getting this fixed That s not how things work  take oil for an example Say there s 100 barrels of oil right now selling for 10 bucks a barrel on the market  If Saudi Arabia said we re going to pump 10 000 barrels of oil before the end of the year into the market  this means the supply will eventually grow by 1000 times by EOY  Given so much SUPPLY  and demand stays the same  Price will effectively go down The only way a price would go up is if Supply decreases or demand increases  now for SOLANA we know the supply will increase to 450 million by end of 2020 so the only other way is if demand increases MORE than the rate at which supply increases So I ask you  for what reason should price increase or better yet why is demand high or increasing im not confident  i just think that as right now the supply is LOW  and the demand quite HIGH  so it would pump regardless of the supply in 6 12 months  These markets are irrational supply and demand works for all market  Just like how excess supply entering market from mt gox and plus token scam collapse bitcoin youre forgetting this is crypto  logical and rational ideas dont apply here On what basis  You sound very confident with this answer

of SOLANA  still TBD though Also   why did you create a new account to talk trash against KIN  Are you just posing as a well known Kin investor to try and scare people into panic selling Truth tends to have a bitter taste to it  Again  this post wasn t supposed to be Kin Koolaid boi hour  We wanted to talk to some legit Solana holders who invested specifically in the interest of Solana Hmmm  I m not so sure that your argument is sound  I too am curious to see what affect this will have on SOL  however I don t think it s fair to assume that SOL will drop just because of it s association with KIN  Let s be real   most crypto projects are down  and Kin at least has the legitimate excuse of being in a legal fight with one of the most powerful government agencies in the world  If they survive that fight I think that they will resurface all the stronger for it Man   I can taste the spite and malice dripping from all your posts  It s like you are on a personal crusade to destroy Kin because you are salty it didn t make you rich How do we not know that you could be Ted s alter ego just to mess with his fans and see what negative information he can extract to fix what is broken that he might not see The power of inflation to destroy the US  dollar values buying power is something that is going to be appreciated more and more in the coming months  64 cents per SOL can be 2 cents in a pretty big hurry and the volumes being traded as the price declines is pretty suspect  It looks to me like insiders are dumping ahead of the curve  Having a coin with 10 TRILLION Tokens and 1 to 3 Million users is going to have an effect and it might be the opposite of what you expect  Bitcoin has a 21 Million Limit   but to be fair each bitcoin can be broken down into 100Million parts  Solana  has what 500M coins total   and now your blockchain is going to be used by a Token with a 1 5 Trillion circulating supply and a 10 Trillion total supply  Think about what that means  For Kin it means another blockchain but what does it mean for the SOL holders   RAGNAROK  TEOTWAWKI in terms of Dollar value Its no longer SOLANA  its the KiK Interactive show  LOSING  93  of their value since the ICO 3 years of straight Losses  https   etherscan io token 0x818fc6c2ec5986bc6e2cbf00939d90556ab12ce5 tokenInfo Take a look at todays prices for SOLANA and imagine losing 95  of todays price   Pro Tip if this deal goes through you wont have to imagine it You will probably live it  The volumes being traded and the declining price is the key  some one is selling out ahead of the curve KNOWING they can buy back later for next to nothing  Been there done that bought the Shitcoin  You won t hear it until its too late TLDNR  SOLANA is phucked and the price is going to SUBMARINE set a sell at 66 68 70  and watch what happens  NOTHING Ya cause I decided I didn t want to be brought down to your level so I chose to take myself out of the conversation  Being the bigger man  holding myself accountable  and not getting involved in your drama and hatred You talked all that shit and deleted your post  Foh Yes Yes  enjoy the win  Probably the first real one you guys had in months  However that investment makes one question the judgement of Solana leadership and if they are all what they cracked up to be  If the SEC turns around and wins next week  they essentially nailed their brand name to a dead token Now did you buy Kin because you were a Sol holder or did you buy Sol because you were a Kin holder Ehh good catch  Happens time to time when your typing away  I ll tell you what  I ll fix it just for you There it is  The Kin Koolaid boi always shows its true colors  Look at all that nastiness and vitriol   Let it all out buddy Yes sir   i am first in line  as soon as i heard about solana invested on it  I keep buying it  Check them out at solana org great team with great tech from the biggest tech firm in the game  Solid project You are free to ignore  yet here you are  I see that you did not deny that Kik pays these apps to force implement Kin  Today is actually a win for you  I ll admit Im shocked that Kik is not the ones paying Solana in this agreement  Which makes more puzzling  So thats why I wanted to hear from people who invested in Solana for reasons other than Kin  One could argue that its poor judgement by Solana leadership to make bed felllows with a company like Kik If you look at your history users will see that you a cheerleading lap dog for a worthless shitcoin  Any user reading should be objective to both opinions and let the facts speak for themselves 95  down from ICO and paying mediocre apps to push air transactions on its userbase your definition of successful  Ok Geez  nothing but koolaid bois responding here  Maybe Solana buying the support of a brain dead cult is a strategic move  They now have a bunch of flunkies at their disposal Before anyone looks into this please look into the OP  Look at his history  His only goal is to attack kin which is actually an incredibly successful project and is used by millions of people already  The OP is just someone with way to much hate in them that s leaving a trail of biased negativity  Please look at their history and then do your own research on kin and make your own decisions  This person will fall into your project with Solana and start the FUD here too  DYOR Sit down Looking for unbiased opinion from people who purchased  SOL based of its own merits and tech  We already know what a koolaid cultist would say mad yet  Looser Of course  i am loading my bags with solana now Hodl both   and yes
2020-05-23,0.637414621895,0.638848874061,0.58824731869,But u aeyakovenko you have 2 guys here  perhaps 1 guy with 2 accounts  who are not asking tough questions  They are just spreading FUD  just toxic people They have a history of lying and misleading their investor base over the course of losing 95  of its ICO value  One of the two board members predicted the price of Kin would 10x before 2020 on twitter while Kik was planning to liquidate all of its assets and lay off 90  of its staff back in Sept 2019  The price would proceed to plummet 75  of the value at that time and has barely recovered since They promised big exchanges and partners for years on end and never delivered  Furthermore  they take investor funds and pay mediocre app developers to force implement kin in their applications  Some of the bigger apps live Rave  dont even offer legit use cases  They just push transactions to inflate rigged usage statistics  They claim there a millions of people using Kin  but a quick cash tag search on twitter will show only a small handfull of Kin Shills talking about it  Kik then takes the fabricated data and markets itself as the most used cryptocurrency I could go on and on  Visit r kinfoundationtruth for more info Other than the SEC lawsuit  why would you say they have a poor reputation Yes Are you referring to Kik Kin Foundation as the organization with a poor reputation u SolanaLabs I second this  He has been toxic for the kin community for a long time  I promise he is not asking questions out of curiosity or to benefit anyone  he is only spreading fud trying to damage your project now  Please handle him before it gets out of hand and he veers people away from your project that won t do their own research and realize he s full of it You ll see that he is toxic and not just asking questions out of curiosity  We have been dealing with him for a long time Ever since their binance launch  the Solana team has proven its self to be incompentent and unable to live up to multiple commitments  In addition they just announced that they are investing a organization with a poor reputation that is currently being sued by the SEC  With the current circulating supply debacle and uncertain inflation schedule  I would not recommend purchasing  SOL tokens  As always DYOR  Best of luck If I was a SOL holder I would be selling out now as fast as I could and just wait on the sidelines  Why  Because its going down to 3 cents or less and its going to get sold down quick  Keep watching its going to be an epic lesson  They will try and pump it but the founders will be exiting their positions to buy back much much lower  wait and see 0 599495 USD   6 43  0 00006492 BTC   6 79 I m curious to see if there will be a thoughtful response to this post  I would like to get the team s perspective  although there are a lot of questions to answer  I had intended on investing in this project  but now that decision hangs in the balance  depending on how this post is reacted to Tricky imprecise and indefinite syntax indeed  But to go on completely against what they said about issuing tokens without previously announcing it  then proceed to release unannounced 8m tokens to cancel out the majority of the proposed burn is a giant logey in every Solana holders face  And you re right  Much like Kik  you can t believe a word that comes out of their mouths  Like they say  birds of a feather flock together  and these two organizations are shady AF to say the least gt   we aim to burn the tokens   Not we will burn the tokens they will just aim to  they might aim and miss whoops sorry about that   we will aim again and see what happens  Beware of imprecise and indefinite syntax  Kin holders know this because before the Kin sale it was stated    any unsold tokens will be burned    Lo and behold all of the unsold tokens were given away instead and Kik Interactive twisted themselves into pretzels trying to explain that GIVING AWAY UNSOLD TOKENS was the same as burning them  Pro Fucking Tip u ted_on_reddit ITS FUCKING NOTSo your opaque blockchain on Solana and the founders stated   we aim to burn the tokens   is not really worth the electrons its printed with  You will burn those tokens by such and such a date or you will not  you make definitive statements Not weasely syntax leaving ambiguity and outs  Any way SOLANA does not SOLVE KINS LIQUIDITY PROBLEM  It will solve SOLANAS high market price by dragging Solana into the crosshairs of the SEC and providing a litigious future and uncertain outlook for SOL  This will allow all the weakhands to exit gracesfully and leave the bagholders waiting for muh moon launch  If you have made money with SOL be proactive and get out now  you like it so much you can probably buy back later for much much less   Kin is not going to add value to SOLANA and Solana is not going to add value to KIN  Kin is a POISON PILL that will choke Solana  The SEC will finish the job Kin started     THATS NO MOON   ITS A DEATH STAR  Keep watching the price fall   and fall it will Folks that ask the tough questions are doing so because they care   Please keep it civil though We are working on it   Ideally folks outside of the core team should be building out explorers   Otherwise if everything is done by the core team it s nearly impossible to verify  Honestly  we appreciate the work everyone is putting into monitoring what s happening on the chain   This is a huge part of securing the chain I cant answer this for certain  But what I can tell you is that they have a bullshit blockchain explorer that doesn t do simple things like displaying a timestamp on transactions  making it very difficult for people to hold them accountable As of April 27  the Foundation does not have any plans to introduce more tokens to the market  Any plans to do so will be disclosed publicly beforehand     After speaking with Binance and our market maker  we plan to reduce the circulating supply by   removing the  11 365 067 supply from the market within the next 30 days  After removing the supply  we aim to burn the tokens         Source  https   medium com solana labs solana will reduce its

where all the coins are  and 11 million coins just magically appear  Solana has been getting robbed quietly as volumes increase and the price drops  and then more volume comes along and the price drops again  Who can afford to sell Sol AT ANY PRICE  the people who created and control it   thats who  No rush on that Blockchain explorer huh You and I both know   THERE IS NO KIN FOUNDATION We  know it is William Mougayar and Ted Livingston and we both know who the power bottom is in that relationship       Do  you mind if I quote you     This is the internet dude      This is my primary

Siphon off investors value indeed  As I noted if you are in the Crenshaw area we can go the gym and do some boxing and work this out like men  If you are not then please consider a visit to Los Angeles in the future  perhaps the next KIN meet up and we will work things out in person like men Shut the fuck up already you turd burglar Or you know my name  IS   Frederick Charles WilsonIII  because that s the name I was given at birth and thats what it says on my drivers license and at the age of 56 I can speak my mind as I see fit If you take my money then you can take the criticism of

trash about other people but when push comes to shove they are cowards  I am not that kind or my name is not Frederik Charles Wilson III You are incorrect   As for the insult to my intellectual acuity I would suggest the insult proffered is more illustrative of the person using it You don t like my opinions because they do not follow the Kool Aid of your preferred narrative  Facts are facts and truth is truth    In 3 years      Kin has lost  93     5       u ted_on_reddit is fond of trumpeting KIN is the most used cryptocurrency in the world  because that sounds better than its lost the most money in every market rally since 2017  Prediction time  Solana has nothting to worry about  TED pivots on a dime with no warning and the SEC is going to put paid to this whole situation by the end of  September latest gt I don t think it s fair to assume that SOL will drop Have you looked at and can you read a chart  look at the volumes being traded as the price continues to decline  Have you never seen that before anywhere   Stellar XLM Lumens never felt a ripple when they onboarded  KIN  I expected we would enjoy enhanced liquidity  and some price appreciation because of the XLM  Dev Team and its network   You know how that worked out don t you  The average KIN holder has more  KIN Tokens than the whole of the SOLANA network  ok thats not true  Quite a few of Kin Holders have Double Triple Quadruple the amount of tokens of the entire Solana Network  and if we take the low number of 1 5 Million users a day along with that  Solana may live to choke on the adoption   500M is a number ripe for market manipulation and I see nothing but trouble ahead for Solana holdersIf the volumes being sold do not decline and the price increase then they are in for a roller coaster ride  Kin did nothing for Stellar except clog the network  it will do the same for Solana  Ted mooted ORBS before and they were dismissed without a word and Ethereum he dismissed calling it dial up technology  Vitalik Buterin is going to live to see Ted Livingston eat those words tks for tipping bro  nothing but respect for ya  take care Their coin supply 500m is miniscule in comparison to KINs 10 Trillion and circulating supply of 1 4Trillion and the tail don t wag the dog  This will no longer be the SOLANA NETWORK it will be the KIN SOLANA NETWORK  A MINNOW does not swallow a WHALE and LIVE  The Kin Contagion with its 3 year history of losses will infect the SOLANA Network and crush its value  and I submit that the charts show insiders selling out ahead of the curve  increasing volume and declining prices only means 1 thing RAGNAROK and the race to get out ahead of the curve Thanks so much  Ya I didn t want him to already catch the Solana community off guard you know  5000 u kinnytips Haha I got you no biggy That s bullshit  Two very different people with very distinct typing styles   We re only sharing facts to uninformed Solana holders who are just learning about Kin today  So shut your face Fred makes a good point  What happens if the SEC wins a motion to Disgorge Kik  Investors are going to see that Solana s proclaimed big partnership blew up in their faces and would show a total lack of judgement  All for what  Just to be able to say all of Rave App s air transactions happen on Solana Blockchain Yo  I was referring to lying Ted  bro  My bad BlueM44  nice posting btw  We have to expose and alert users like this  Losers Haha that s deep dude    Not his alter ego and don t particular want to be associated with him at all lol You should all block

2020-05-24,0.613288867401,0.613288867401,0.548431875411,Good  Now you are up to date with Solana current events  I m going to go enjoy a hamburger of the grill  You enjoy whatever it is that you koolaid bois like to do Well I came here looking for info as well  I saw you basically took over with a couple of posts and I just can t help myself sometimes  I ll waste your time all day so keep replying    I literally commented because I knew you d reply    Thanks for playing You re the one who commented on our post  If it didnt apply to you   you could have easily ignored it  We brought up the question of why Solana is paying kin to migrate to the  SOL Community  While the question was directed at  SOL Holders  a bunch of Kin Koolaid boi cultist ran to the rescue with their brain dead opinions  still unable to counter our arguments of why Kin is trash Furthermore we took issue with the Coin Circulation Scam that u SolanaLabs pulled off in the last month  More can be read about that here  https   www reddit com r solana comments gp9hh9 solana_plays_dirty_math_tricks_said_it_would_burn  sort new All I know is I came to this sub to learn more about Solana itself  like yourself  You can keep your labeled insults to yourself  People in history have labeled people just to insult them  it s not new  and you try to twist it like     I m not insulting you  I m labeling you You don t even know my stance  only that I think you stalk and prey on anything involved with kin  You d have a better chance of changing my mind by letting me come to it on my own  Which I did  And I still fight you at every chance  What s that say about your tactic Don t bother I looked it up I m uncultured because I don t know American history  Fuckin ignorant prick Look it up  It was a cult ran by Jim Jones back in the day  A bunch of brainwashed lemmings were tricked into drinking poisoned koolaid and dropped dead What s Jonestown Its a reference to Jonestown you uncultured buffoon Not very accurate  koolaid sucks Who said it was an insult  Its a label that describes what you are You always must have the last word  That hasn t changed about you  Even when you regurgitate the same lame  insult   Ps  No one s insulted and it s super lame I bet that isn t the only thing you take koolaid boi That s not even the first definition so I m going to take it as he finds him annoying because I m not sick  You turd burglar You should be upset at the person who said it you jackass  That term is sexual by definition  The guy isn t trying to spin anything  You re just a moron     https   www urbandictionary com define php term turd 20burglar  https   www urbandictionary com define php term turd 20burglar Another Kin Koolaid boi to the rescue  I have yet to hear from a real Solana head and Im starting to believe they don t exist  Maybe it makes sense to pay for the support of a brain dead cult it s Solana s choice to make the gamble  it might pay  it might not  who are you to try and be the savior they never asked for  You really don t think Solana hasn t considered all of these points before making an announcement You don t make sense  by your logic Stellar should have tanked just by being associated with KIN  but Stellar is doing well  what about eth  you know the first chain KIN was on  KIN started losing value back then    eth went with the market and recovered a bit KIN never rebounded due to outside factors My point is you are trying to entice fear in this sub  SOL price will not be affected directly because of being associated with KIN you re sick  i think i know who this is  they kept on twisting everything in a sexual way in an anti kin forum if someone calls you a dick  IT S NOT AN INVITATION gt This is my primary account  Account deleted after 24 hrs of posting lol What he says is true  Kin is an incredibly successful project  Lmao  They bought their metrics and are on the brink of being labeled a security Truth I would not recommend investing at this time     u aeyakovenko    https   www reddit com user aeyakovenko    amp  team lied when they said they would announce beforehand when ever they release new tokens on to the market and then proceeded to unlock 8m unannounced  It sets a precedent that they can and will drop tokens in to the circulating supply whenever they feel like it  And with no CMC   Binance info pages and a shitty explorer  they can continue to screw over SOL holders with out any transparency or accountability Iam not able to find that token burn tweet on their twitter official profile  I was very interested to invest but now it looks shady because they deleted that tweet  they think the community is fool  there is something fishy with the circulating supply because there is no binance info on this damn token u SolanaLabs marketing gimmicks are attributed to a bottom feeding crab named Austin Virts I hate seeing things like this  After learning about this project and watching all the interviews I was pretty excited  Then I checked out the telegram    bots and fake sub numbers    not a good look  I do believe these guys are getting things done but these antics are pretty tron like Unfortunately this requires a party stupid enough to actually pay them Taking a monetary incentive to join Solana for instance  If they claim Stellar is that bad  clearly the move to Solana should be natural and not profit based They advertise that the circulating supply is 8m  then a third party discovers that the real circulating supply is 19m  As a remedy to this issue the commit to burn 11m tokens and when its time to deliver they spontaneously release 8m tokens resulting in a 3m token burn  Yet we are the toxic people   Kin Koolaid Cultist don t care if they are getting railroaded  They HATE when somebody points it out to them tho Mr Yakovenko    blessed with the patience of a saint I guess I genuinely believe that if they have the energy to engage and care they have the energy to do so in a positive way  All we need to do is cover them to the light side of the force Thanks for the info  Definitely worth looking into  I ve been a fan of Kin for a while  but I m always willing to take a deeper look

2020-05-30,0.581355069208,0.602489267522,0.567050101707,Well my friend you seem to be ignoring basic math and data  A 3rd Party Market Maker affiliate of Binance has control of 50  the circulating supply  Which means every  SOL holder is at the mercy of the Market Makers discretion  They control the price action    Many  SOL Holders believed the Circulating supply was 8m at their time of purchase  just to find out weeks later that their holdings were inflated  The Price has steadily declined since with little to no signs or recovery I just don t see your narrative reflected in the price action of SOL TL DR  The Solana Executive team lied to the every  SOL Holder about Circulating supply  advertising it was less than more than half of what it was   19M Tokens vs  8m Tokens     Team said they would burn the 11m tokens and said that they would announce beforehand when any more tokens would be released  Then went ahead to release 8m Tokens before burning 11m tokens  thus resulting in a circulating supply of 16m Tokens instead of 8m Tokens   Most people would define this as a scam  Buyer beware  DYOR Meh  not impressed with the article  Too much hysteria for my taste  Rather look at the actual data Looking at the charts for Sol token suggest we are still in the accumulation phase  and people are still buying  While this current price point seem high for the price action  we need to form a solid bottom before we can see a steady increase in price  If you are a HODL er just wait your day will come  if you are a day trader this needs sometime to settle   think FB  or any other new coin really   if you are an accumulator  you know what to do TL DR Buy the dip
2020-05-31,0.587902737594,0.593997496664,0.569244662492,And how do you know the demand will be there  Are you a psychic  Seems like you dont understand the business environment in addition to economics  Just because it looks good on paper doesnt mean it will get adopted  This project mainnet isnt even released yet and you want to assign a 1B valuation to it LOL  Its like me saying I have the cure for cancer right now and you pay me for it now and I promise to release the process in a year And I ve been around long enough to see when they start out lying and conning  Its a telltale sign of them telling you who you are dealing with and very rarely do you see a 180 degree culture change I have just been around for many years  Same old song and dance my friend  It s crypto  Not for the faint hearted The entire point was that the demand eventually will be there for 500M  max supply  at prices of  2  I know what the network is worth and how to properly value a cutting edge layer 1 like Solana   You obviously are new  I m not a moon boi  I give crypto a bad name because I understand short term price movements do not affect the long term value of the underlying asset  Nice man  Can I ask what is your background and expertise So far I ve seen the team   Lie about the circulating supply   Lie about burning the tokens  Lie about coin release protocol  Build a shitty blockchain explorer  Fail to get basic things such as a binance infopage and CMC profile updated  Pay a failed ICO to migrate blockchains and use their padded statistics to include in their own marketing materials  Pointing at other teams saying  well  look what they did  is elementary and a pathetic cop out of taking responsibility for one own shitty actions  It demonstrates even further a lack of character   As far as the market goes  every  SOL holder is at the mercy of the discretion of one shadow entity that controls the market with more than 50  of the circulating supply  I won t be surprised by any price movements in any direction Lol you clearly don t understand supply and demand  The demand is at what it is right now  Imagine an influx of 300m token while demand is less than 16m token  Price drops of course Totally understand your concerns  The markets do not normally react much to these small issues  I have seen much worse and the price of the asset will still rise  If you believe in the tech and core engineers  then I would say to not worry about it too much  Go look at Tezos past  It was much  much worse on so many different occasions but they are still arguably the second best layer 1  smart contract capable  after Ethereum  I mean you can even look at ETH and they have done worse  They rolled back an  immutable ledger  to recover DAO funds  Doesn t really get much worse than that except maybe the years of waiting for ETH 2 0 That s all good and all  But all of this is really diverting the topic  There s nothing  uncertain  or  doubtful  that Solana Leadership lied about its initial circulating supply  And then lied two more times about burning the Market Makers Tokens and letting everybody know beforehand when they would release more coins on the market  They literally lied for weeks misleading every  SOL Holder  Like it or not this is a huge red flag and exhibits horrendous character traits  Any informed investor should be concern that such incompetence could rear its ugly head again in the future You need buying selling power on each side to support price action  Short term  yes there may be a lot of downward price movement with token releases  If there is not enough support  then technically the price could go down to 0 but that s not going to happen  My point is  if you are investing long term  then short term price due to token releases should not matter  If you want a short term option  then Solana may not be the best choice  Everybody has different metrics they look at  Most people do not understand the underlying dynamics so if the open market is buying a token with low liquidity then the price will go far past it s actually value  Then you also need to factor in market manipulation  liquidity  tokenomics etc  It s all very complex in crypto  much more than traditional markets  I m just speaking from my experience with finance and crypto  My professional background is Finance  fintech specifically   but in recent years I ve been full time crypto  Solana is the real deal  Do not listen to FUD  Proof of History will be the standard for many networks in the future  You re a bit early to the party honestly  I ve been telling my community to accumulate under  1 and all the way up to  2 until EOY  Solana is 100  worth  1B market cap which means you can safely accumulate up to  2 and not worry about dilution because that math if for fully diluted Has literally zero to do with them lying about circulating supply and balking on their solution to fix it nearly a month afterwards If you participated in the Coinlist ICO and immediately dumped SOL on Binance  once the token were released  you would have made 3 5x in USD  Not bad for 1mo of investment  Rest is all hype and hysteria  Just buy and sell high I ll check out the TG sometime  But I still don t get where the extra 300M comes from once the all the tokens are unlocked  If thats the case  why not mint a gazillion tokens and create more money out of thin air That s not how it works my friend  Market caps are literally based on free market price x tokens  You will see different sources base it off circulating  total  max  All you need to worry about  long term  is fully diluted supply x current price  If you think the current state of development is worth less than a max supply cap then it s a good buy  Here is a good way to understand Solana is a layer 1 network  therefore it should be compared against other layer 1s  ETH  XTZ  XLM etc   You also need to factor in network functionality capability  smart contracts  tx time etc  When you compare these networks  you ideally would be looking at all of them fully diluted with current state of development  Solana is currently valued at 30  of similar layer 1s  SOL is actually much better technologically than most layer 1s  It is easily worth the same as as many in the top 20 Tron   1B  Cardano   2B Tezos   2B EOS   2 5B XLM   1 5B In my opinion  Solana is worthy of being in that range  All of those are not even fully diluted for each network  Here is another example Algorand is a very comparable network to Solana as far as development  team  functionality etc  ALGO circulating mcap is  194M but fully diluted is  2 5B  Solana is barely 10  fully diluted to Algorand max mcap but is a very comparable project  So if you re buying ALGO at these prices over Solana then you re saying it is 10x better fully diluted  This is laughable if anybody truly believes that  If you re investing long term then you should look at the token distribution relative to when you believe you ll close your position  All of the networks I named should be valued in the range of  1B  5B fully diluted mcap  Hopefully this helps  I started a financial support group last month to help people understand the complexities here  This is a simplified synopsis and should be taken lightly  Only for perspective  Good luck  If you need any more help  reach out on telegram  jpbanks or alhog protonmail comGood luck to you Market cap doesn t simply grow by releasing coins  Think of Market cap like a Pizza  Right now they say the market Cap is around  10M with 16M  SOL Tokens in circulation which are priced approx 60 Cents give or take  Think of the price per token as a 1 Pizza slice  Releasing 450M tokens in to circulation doesn t make the pizza any bigger  But it makes the slices a helluva lot smaller But you realize even a fully diluted supply put the market cap at  300M   Anybody who is concerned with this is not very informed on how to properly value your positions  If you do not understand why SOL is worth  1B total supply circulating  then you should not be in crypto right now  Wait until it s mainstream and safer  Complaints like these remind me of Tezos ICO   go see how that turned out  XTZ was considered the biggest scam of 2017  Sigh some of you need to stop relying on others opinions so much and learn to DYOR The untrustworthy Solana Executives are talking about having auctions outside of exchange sales  The tokenomics behind this project is turning into a giant murky mess Wait till Jan 2021  Over 450m will be in circulation by then  Best time to buy is after that release if you believe in project So if Solana kept their word and didn t release 8m Tokens into the market before burning 11m of them  thus bringing circulating supply back down to 8m  that wouldn t have an effect on the price Price is Truth in the game of markets  So say otherwise is to admit you don t know what game you are playing  And the narrative that you are spinning isn t being reflected in the price of  SOL You re totally diverting the topic by the way  And now your assuming I bought the high  What is the point of this  to run inference of the truth  You re just babbling trying to sound smart  The article wasn t really about price or the tech  It was about a resounding character issues that are present within Solana team  The facts are that Solana lied  and one Shadow entity has the power to control the whole market  Any TA at this point can be flushed down the toilet as its useless gt Well my friend I always love a response that starts this way  It is like the southern equivalent  of bless your heart  But I digress I am sorry you bought at the high  it sucks when an investment doesn t just go up  But markets don t work that way  And if a market is behaving in this manner then you know it is fixed broken  A market needs to have price discovery to function properly  The Markets are still sorting out a fair price for  SOL  Side note Periodic Auctions can cause prices spikes especially in shallow markets  SOL still has a lot of work ro do  it hasn t formed a bottom yet  and it needs to show staying power as well  But the tech is robust  and the Proof Of History is a novel concept that has yet to be thoroughly explored and it has more potential than many other projects for that reason alone  Good luck w  your investment

2020-06-06,0.661071494785,0.66161878907,0.611780567274,I don t think they have anything to hide  U S  crypto regulations are pretty difficult to navigate  I just want to know how to become involved with this project  given the fact that U S  law seems to be boxing me out Thanks for the response  I understand there are legal barriers in play  However  what about purchasing the token  joining staking pools  etc   It is pretty important that Solana ultimately gets cleared to operate within the United States   given that the U S  is a major center of DLT innovation  Solana is one of my favorite crypto projects  and I d like to know how I can get involved as an American For the longest time Sol team confidently proclaimed there is only 8 2mil sol in circulation in first month  They were confident  Same confidence as now with 70k tps  As an investor that has been lied to on something so basic  like really so basic  I no longer trust anything they say Beware  Project that dont make attempts to woe US citizen might have something to hide since it makes no sense since US is the largest economy and has the largest capital markets  Like how the ICO bubble scam burst in 2018 Hey u scutcheon thanks for reaching out   Unfortunately at this stage this will remain the generally be the case in the near term as far as I know  this is to comply with relevant regulations  There is no immediate plan for this to change for now  thus will only be accepting non U S  entities into the validator program https   news bitcoin com no visa doesnt handle 24000 tps and neither does your pet blockchain  gt When it comes to measuring the speed of new blockchains  the comparison is always with Visa  Despite not being a blockchain  the 24 000 transactions per second Visa reportedly handles have attained mythical status  That figure is unquestioningly trotted out whenever scaling is discussed  In reality  claims of Visa s throughput  as well as those of emerging blockchains  have been greatly exaggerated  gt Bitcoin was envisaged as a payments system and so it was natural  long before the store of value notion emerged  that comparisons would be made with existing global payment systems  Bitcoin s early adopters knew that if the technology took off  some time in the future it would need to handle magnitudes more transactions per second than the 7 it could muster  Someone mentioned Visa with their magical 24k per second  and it s stuck ever since  gt Only that figure isn t entirely accurate  In fact it s not even remotely accurate  In reality  Visa processes around 1 700 transactions per second  a figure it rarely exceeds  The larger number is the one that Visa claims  and it s the one that s usually referenced in comparison to bitcoin and every other blockchain    In theory Visa should be able to handle that volume   in fact it s been reported that its servers can handle as much as 56k tps   but that s all theoretical    much like the claimed throughput of new blockchains that can operate at the speed of light in the lab  but significantly worse in the wild  There s a big difference between operating a testnet on a bunch of Amazon servers and a mainnet distributed around the globe   You Can t Have Your Cake and Eat It   gt Speed and throughput come at the expense of decentralization  and the more you increase the former  the more of the latter you lose  Blockchains such as EOS and NEO may be  faster  than bitcoin  but they re also highly centralized because they rely on a much lower number of validator nodes  among other things  There is nothing inherently wrong with having a fast but semi centralized blockchain  but it is never going to become a global payment system with censorship resistant properties that can rival bitcoin  gt  No  Visa Doesn t Handle 24 000 TPS and Neither Does Your Pet Blockchain  gt   Even at 1 700 transactions per second  Visa is still significantly faster than bitcoin and most other blockchains  but this figure is at least a far more realistic one to reference and a more achievable one to aim for    Blockchain scaling can be implemented in a range of ways  from increasing the block size to layer two solutions  Lightning Network  to using techniques such as sharding  all of which carry various trade offs  There is no reason why Bitcoin Core  Bitcoin Cash  and other blockchains cannot reach much higher speeds and levels of throughput without compromising on their decentralization  but this will take time and tech  gt No  Visa Doesn t Handle 24 000 TPS and Neither Does Your Pet Blockchain for now  any time a new blockchain starts making promises about  beating Visa s 24 000 tps   be sceptical and examine the fineprint  IOTA s meant to be fast and scalable  but like a kid who s terrified of removing the stabilizers from their bike  it still doesn t function without its coordinator  Hashgraph is also meant to be fast  but it comes with threats to sue anyone who tries to fork it and any blockchain that can be sued isn t a decentralized network  Come to think of it  it s more like Visa  by Kai Sedgwick solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io  we are on mainnet  its just in the  beta

2020-06-18,0.581582391057,0.650308613252,0.579285208673,Now wait just a second  I never said anything other than the possible implications that may stem from this  Its 2020  and anyone who understands cancel culture can see that this a PR nightmare waiting to happen  There is enough here to at least investigate if Kin is being used by a pedophile ring  Like it or not  the potential connections are there and this damning lawsuit brings it to light And lastly  the terms to describe Kin holders who are  extremely vile and disrespectful anytime brings up negative information about their favorite shitcoin is a valid title  not a derogatory term  Unlike yourself  most Koolaid bois hurl personal insults and fail to make any actual arguments  Furthermore  This post was made on a Solana forum  before it was censored   yet koolaid bois go out of there way to discredit solid information that was intended to inform Solana Holders I used BTC and USD as examples of other currencies used regularly for crime  Because that is what KIN is  a currency  KIN Foundation has no control over what the apps or its users are doing with it This document doesn t claim anything against KIN of any sort  just a fact of the matter that it is a medium in the app that users could use for exchange  Just like any legal document that mentions what could have been used to trade with  In this case they describe what KIN is as that likely wouldn t be apparent to those who will be reading this involved in the case  What you are implying is heresay and subject to be proven  this document implies none of that as it pertains to KIN The constant use of the terms Koolaid  cultists or any other apparent derogative term  derogative in this case because you use it as an attempt to insult  against anyone who disagrees with you shows your level of maturity  If you were serious  like actually serious you would lose the childish terms Nor BTC or the USD was mentioned in the complaint above   Kin however is the only medium of transaction on available Kik messenger correct  Kik messenger has a history that extends well into the previous ownership of Kin s parent company  This is grounds to investigate if Kin has become the choice of currency for Kik pedophiles  This should be a deep concern for u aeyakovenko as he has pledged to pay Kin to host what could potentially be foul and heinous transactions  Being affiliated with child sex trafficking would be very harmful to Solana s already tarnished reputation The audience that we try to reach will completely understand and appreciate the information presented  Angry Koolaid cultist are of no concern whatsoever In my opinion you both went off the rails and that s a bad look on both of you If you re trying to prove a point it literally makes no difference who you are talking to  it s for those who come a long to read it later and might not reply I see how you are trying to create the association between the lawsuit and KIN  Guilty by association  right  I get it But the context is that it s not being lumped in as a culprit  they aren t even claiming child sex trafficking was connected to KIN  or the use of KIN led to it  They quite literally are pointing out the dollar amounts because they want some  They are showing KIK isn t broke and has the cash to pay substantial damage penalties Now if they were actually saying sex was bought and sold using KIN as a way to hide identities  well now we are treading into Bitcoin territory  or even the god almighty USD  or any fiat currency for that matter Bit of a stretch man I would have gladly helped anyone outside of your deranged Kool aid cult  Your other dimwitted friend started off kinsplaining from the jump and it made zero difference whether what was presented to him  So why bother  I gave him the Control F tool he needed Here s the main take away  Kin is now being associated with Child Sex Trafficking Lawsuit  No matter how ever way you try to slice it  ITS A BAD LOOK  So bad of a look your leadership is actively censoring any post that mentions the lawsuit Ok since OP refuses to support their  work  and fights everyone when asked for a TLDR or quick run down  here is the excerpt that they are referencing  or what I can only assume  47  Furthermore  relying at least partially at Kik Messenger subscribers  base  KIK INTERNATIONAL and or MediaLab launched a Minimum Viable Product   MVP   that integrated Kin 15 within Kik Messenger  The MVP allowed users to use Kin to access tiered premium content  such as sticker packs  that were unlocked depending on the amount of Kin owned  Upon information and belief  KIK INTERNATIONAL believes that stickers are quite possibly a billion dollar industry  Upon information and belief  KIK INTERNATIONAL and or MediaLab amie s  to achieve financial result similar to a messaging company  Line which earned over  250 million in a year  solely from digital stickers  Upon information and belief  KIK INTERNATIONAL believes that roughly 20 percent of the thousands of TDE  token distribution event  purchasers linked their wallets to their Kik accounts  and participants applauded KIK INTERNATIONAL for implementing Kin into Kik online  Bruh if you re going to post it  and want to be taken seriously  do the leg work and show what you found  Not just the link to the 48 page legal document Interpret it how you want but this is not damaging to KIN and infact shows KIN works as a payment option and monetizing engine  It was brought up because the lawyers want a piece of that pie to divy up between themselves and their client s  Now if that s not how you would describe  THAT S WHY YOU SUPPORT YOUR WORK  Clown The trauma from finding out your mother is also your aunt must be preventing you from realizing when you are contradicting yourself  Move along filthy swine It s hilarious that you think I would defend it  There are far better projects to focus on and arguing with a person who lives in his mothers basement and get s off on weird fetish porn isn t really a constructive use of my day Really don t give AF what you think  Im not wasting my time trying to break information down to a brainwashed and rekt koolaid boi  Its obvious you are going to defend your worthless bag regardless of what information is presented  There are other people here that aren t spineless enablers that will see that this situation is totally unacceptable Since u kevin_from_kin decided to protect his child trafficking enabling employer and censor the lawsuit complaint link  you can now find it below    https

2020-06-19,0.62240659565,0.836398481391,0.620383816305,As the Solana token user base continues to grow  it is of utmost importance for the Solana Foundation to maintain a high level of transparency with regards to the SOL token Moving forward  the Solana Foundation will be releasing a monthly transparency report to cover the previous month s token activity  expected token activity for the current month  and other updates in relation to the SOL token  The goal for these reports is simple  token activity transparency I ll be curious to see how this transition plays out  I hope that the Solana blockchain can deliver the sort of speeds they are claiming  Already Kin s network is beginning to show signs of inadequacy for the number of transactions they are running Brother if you read my comment to them you d realise I said nothing that I didn t say here  not that I actually care what you think And I went on to scold them for not being respectful  Drop the self righteous act I knew you would read it and come back here  how many usernames have you had  I don t trust you  I trust you about as much as a I trust KIK not at all  or government even less than Kik Nvm I take it back u AnElderGod  I saw the way that you ran back to your cult to beat your chest about the conversation that was had here  That s definitely koolaid boi shit LOL Glad you found it  I wasn t responsible for the post on the KF page or for making this great find    I think you are missing my point of why I am even posting here by diverting into other avenues as they are irrelevant    Its simple    Kik owed Kik Messenger up until Oct 2019 when they sold the app to Media Labs  Kik Messenger still is an active partner in the Kin Ecosystem  Kik Messenger is still plagued with Child Sex Trafficking issues as highlighted in the recent lawsuit  CBS s 48 Hours previously reported that Kik Messenger is the  Killer App  for Child pedophiles   If Kik Messenger is the  Killer App  for Child pedophiles  Does that mean Kin is the Killer currency for Child Pedophiles    If Child pedophiles are actively using Kin to transact  Then why the hell would u aeyakovenko and the rest of  u solanalabs risk their reputation and possibly making themselves liable to lawsuits  The USD is the governments  they can get away with shit like that  A private company like Solana doesn t have that type of power    And lastly  If I am a  SOL Holder  do I want my investment funding immoral companies that enable child pedophiles to conduct pedophila and provide them financial services   To say that they only mention Kin to show that Kik Interactive has money is also a personal opinion and a very biased one at that  We all have no clue what evidence will be presented at discovery  All we know is Kin is specifically named in the initial filing    I will refrain from refering to you as a koolaid boi as you attempted to present an argument and didn t lash out in vile personal attacks  You ll have to excuse me if I come off brash as I ve become accustomed to putting the Koolaid bois back in there place where they belong I guess you just completely missed the point  that Kin is a currency  I don t condone the possible illegal uses that people can come up with  but you can t investigate KIN itself for it  They can investigate the paper trail it could leave  uncovering crimes done by using it  but using the currency itself while commiting a crime isn t a crime  I bring up USD again because you can t charge the government for supplying a currency  usd  when it s the users actions that are illegal  It doesn t work that way   Unless we are talking money crimes  like laundering or extortion    But again  those are actions and the currency itself is not liable And you were using the koolaid term while taking to me  Even if it s in reference to someone else  it s still being used while talking to me and unnecessary  I don t ask you to respect those who are disrespectful to you and can t make a sound argument without stooping to those levels  but you act all righteous and consistently stoop to that level Then you talk about discrediting solid information  yet you do the same thing when someone comes along with solid logic as to why you re wrong Correction to the post above     u kevin _from _kin  https   www reddit com u kevin_from_kin    was not the one who censored the child trafficking lawsuit that mention Kin  It was u Drpoofaloof in efforts to keep the news from effecting the price of Kin
2020-06-20,0.682522764479,0.688583471859,0.625625721953,Really  So there isn t an active child sex trafficking lawsuit against Kik Interactive that both them and Solana have been completely silent about     There isn t sufficient evidence presented that both Kik Interactive and Solana have made efforts to censor this information from their community reddits    Should the neutral reader here be aware that your opinion may be heavily biased because you are a former Kin Developer and had mooched over a billion Kin from the broken KRE This post is absolute junk very good project Is it possible to contribute as a US citizen

2020-06-28,0.713548036244,0.843976500665,0.687094919406,Alright lets us get that accommodated for you m am  That way you no longer are triggered to deflect and defend with terrible arguments  Take Care now  bye bye then No need to keep presenting the facts to you  Go back to some of your accounts that have been banned and you ll get all the proof you need  Im not going to present the facts to you with every single fake new account yall create ma am  And yes you can t stand resistance but yet again you thrive on it lol which may be your whole goal cause you reply very quickly which tells me either you have nothing in your life that is more important than fudding kin OR your being paid to bash kin which is actually what I m leaning to with how much effort you put in it lol Its isn t resistance m am  Its to help you from getting carried away with yourself  If you actually had evidence to proof the facts we present wrong  we d have no issue with it  In fact we d welcome it  You just proved yourself to be a hypocrite  as it is you that doesn t like the sharing of factual information that could have an negative impact on your financial interest  You despise our good deeds so much you ask the admin to have us banned  So yes we can accommodate a block free of charge to help you help yourself Seems like you don t like resistance and would rather block people going against yalls fud You seem to be triggered by our fact presentations and cannot exhibit self control to conduct yourself in a civil manner or ignore us  Would you prefer that we block you from our content M am  We can arrange that for you  That way you no longer have to get nasty and try to force your draconian censorship standards on other forums that won t coddle to koolaid boi demands And i stand by that claim and you were presented evidence to numerous times throughout your period of trying to hurt kin  i just choose not to present facts to you cause they have never changed your mind  Numerous times in your reddit kin career you have been presented facts yet you still hammer false narratives to hurt kin and get violent in private messages when someone does prove you wrong You made the claim that Kin is not Kik Interactive  and you were proven wrong with documentation M am  Its apparent that you don t even care about facts  you are just here to derail the conversation  All we can hope is that the Solana Community sees through your nonsense It takes intellect to recognize intellectual so im guessing that s why you don t see intellect in my response None taken M am  All we ask is that you follow the rules of the post above and stick to the arguments and the facts  It doesn t appear that you have any ground to give anyone life tips  You ve proven that you do not have an intellectual rebuttal so its probably best that you move along More lack of substance  What a petty little bitch It s a free world and everyone is allowed to express themselves  I just hope that this guy is just an ordinary person who has issues  It would be unfortunate if it was someone who was paid to do what he s doing I think the biggest problem in crypto right is a lack of independent minds and a lack of criticism of so many things that are obviously wrong  One of which is the money printing that is going on right now First we had stablecoins  most of which seem to have escaped real audits  and may have no real fiat money backing them Now we have this Defi nonsense  more money printing   Yeah  give me your valuable cryptocurrency and I ll give you this new unknown cryptocurrency  Don t worry  I ve a printer right next me  so you can have more anytime you want   What s so exciting about these loans anyway  and what are they doing with them  Oh yeah  they are using these loans to go and buy more of the cryptocurrency they had before  are they not  This is so stupid  you are just blowing a bubble with this fake Defi money  It s ridiculous  And we have people in the community making meme s about the  Fed money printer goes brrrrrr   No we are also a joke Unfortunately  nobody wants to talk about these things  No no no no  those heavy bags must be protected at all time Umm did you read the rules above  You violated 4 in just this one post  For shame Sorry ma am that you got your feelings hurt again  That wasn t a insult  I was saying your a joke meaning all the comments that come out of your mouth are humorous and false  Again this ain t an insult either just a life tip  but try to not be so emotional and wear your poor feelings on your sleeve and maybe your feelings would get hurt all the time like your a 10 year old girl  Again not insults  just life tips lol oh ya and your life would maybe get a glimpse of happiness in it too You re projecting your own lack of credibility  Zero rationale for any of your opinions and your transparent alt accounts  It s so obvious to spot your dumb ass crying about Kin over and over and over  Get over it silly bitch Its understandable that you lack any credible argument  It s a common problem amongst kool aid bois  Its also hilarious how koolaid bois claim and laugh at others for being rekt  when in reality they are really projecting about their own situation  I guess that is what being 95  down from ICO will do someone  So long Sir You re trying way too hard buddy  Sorry you got rekt Please calm down Sir  there is no need for that type of ornery behavior  I know it may be a great challenge  but if you cannot conduct a conversation like a mature and civil adult  then please move along  Kik Interactive is listed as the primary defendant in the recent Child Sex Trafficking lawsuit filed in April 2020  Although they do not directly own Kik Messenger anymore as of Oct 2019  they have allegedly enabled child pedophiles to abuse children for over a decade during their tenure as owners   https   digitalcommons law scu edu cgi viewcontent cgi article 3192 amp context historicalRecent law changes now allow child abuse victims to be able to file a lawsuit up into the age of 55 in some states  If Kik Interactive loses this lawsuit  it could open the window to additional lawsuits with the new statue of limitation laws in place  Furthermore Kik Interactive still remains in partnership with Medialabs and Kik Messenger  Medialabs is required to buy  100k in Kin tokens from the market for 15 months after the sale agreement and Kin is still implemented within Kik Messenger  Its possible that Kin is being used by child pedophiles Kik Interactive  the company  is no longer affiliated with Kik  the messenger app  Get your shit straight you fucking donkey M am  please refrain from using unsubstantiated personally charged attacks   You are more than welcome do challenge the facts presented  But you do not have the right to make things up and hurl insults because you lack a counter argument  If you cannot be mature and admit when you are proven wrong  then simply ignore the post  Its not that hard Sorry ma am but you don t have the right to only post toxic material known as FUD  If you would post material of all kinds positive and negative then maybe you could be believed but as for now its obvious you only post nonsense in an attempt to hurt kin because you got your feelings hurt that they won t hold your hand since you lost money on an investment that was completely your choice  Again no ma am your a joke and nothing but FUD That is false M am  Kik messenger the app was sold  Kik Interactive the company still exist as the parent company of Kin and has two active lawsuits against them to our knowledge  One by the SEC and the other by a child sex trafficking victim   Look at the recent Solana Migration Proposal  It specifically says Proposed by   KIK INTERACTIVE   You shouldn t speak on this subject because clearly you do know enough     https   github com kinecosystem technology blob master improvement proposals solana migration md  https   github com kinecosystem technology blob master improvement proposals solana migration md    I have every right to post here just like you Please do not infringe your toxic censorship desires on me because you don t like the facts that are presented  Shame on you M am Nope kik was bought out Um    no they are not  Maybe you need to do more research on your investments    The SEC s discovery shows that Kin Foundation s expenses are paid out from Kik Interactive bank accounts  Furthermore all their employees paychecks say Kik Interactive    Kin Foundation   Kik Interactive  No if  ands  or buts about it Who is trading SOL at such high volumes day to day  Total marketcap of 15mil but 2 5mil traded alone in the past 24 hours in one pair  SOL BTC  on Binance u Al3xF what do we have to do to get this guy banned  He did the same thing in the kin subreddit  He is relentless Kik and kin are separate company s  Get a life bro  your embarrassing yourself so bad I guess its a good idea to start doing this when the market maker finally takes theirfoot off all the early investors necks and lets the price go up versus when they were tanking the market the past 2 months   The current price action is exciting  But one must wonder much longer can it maintain  Solana s strategic partner and alleged child sex trafficking enabler Kik Interactive  r kinfoundation  has a big court date coming up July 9th regarding its SEC lawsuit  If the judge rules that Kin is a security and disgorges Kik Interactive  it could have grave results on Kin price  Which may ultimately effects Solana s price due to being bed fellows

price wise  Can it reach heights of etherium Where do you see it listed If you re so sure about that  create a bet on Augur Where exactly is it listed  I don t see SOL in any of the markets at https   crypto com exchange I ve updated the app but don t see it when I search for  SOL G day mate  Solana is Really F      fast   Awesome interview Alexhttps   solana blog 5m transactions should be  50 worth of SOL I dont think a few bad apples in the Kin  app  community should condemn the whole foundation  Facebook  Apple  Google  Tinder  Reddit have all had their platforms used for abhorrent things  As founders and companies all we can do is strive to be better than some of the people who use our platform and hope that the few does not reflect on the great work of the many We ve just started recently  Their documentation   examples are great and the team is very active in their discord server with any and all questions  We give them a great review on their tech   system design thus far   will definitely speak more in future about the developer experience as we get a few more weeks into migration Its probably in your best interest to stay away from the Kin Foundation crowd  Especially if your product   service is aimed towards a young company  Its not a great company at all  They are currently being sued for Child Sex Trafficking  You can read more about it and how Kin and Solana are attempting to censor the information from the community in the cointelegraph article below     http   shorturl at bkpIV  http   shorturl at bkpIV We chose Solana because it was the best technology out on the market today and we believe it will continue to be in future   We are now developing our contracts   programs on Solana  We re hopeful that the initial build should be done in the next month  testing  and then migrating games from our current infrastructure to Solana are two of the biggest hurdles after that   The next move for us as a company other than transitioning to Solana is our graphical dashboard for game developers   Can you clarify more on the  Prize of SOL I m hoping so  One of our goals as a business is to enable other developers to build ontop of the games within our smart contracts  Drop me a line  StardustCanaan on Telegram to discuss your idea if interested Awesome How easy was it to transition and develop on solana Well our community has spoken  amp  you wanted me to interview some of the new IEOs that are springing up again to ask them the tough questions  We will be diving into what these projects are doing  who s behind them  the valuation  token metrics  amp  product market fit  I hope all enjoy this new segment  amp  please leave questions  comments  amp  feedback below Why u choose Solana Whats the next state for Stardust and Solana Whats the next move What do u think of prize of SOL Is it possible in the near future that we can create something on stardust with an easy made features or tools that any people can make without hassle We hear a lot about composability in defi  nothing about composability in gaming and its because mainstream gaming applications havent had a way to easily tap into the blockchain ecosystem  With games on chain there will be an ecosystem that builds to surround and provide value to these games utilizing Solana s infra We share your vision I m excited for Stardust    Thanks Why did you guys decide to have a blockchain integrated into your product Great questions 1  We originally started on Ethereum back in 2018 and tried to use Loom network as a side chain  It was unfortunately too slow and way too expensive Recently we tried NEAR but their technology lacked some core features   we weren t confident today that they were able to answer the questions surrounding sharding and how that would scale long term  Solana being ready today is a no brainer when it comes to scaling Stardust to the next level  We re confident that their network will withstand the test of time 2  Its hard to give an exact number here  but we will be staking ourselves   making our program rent exempt so we ll prob be HODLing a fair amount  Our goal is to try and push 5m monthly transactions by the end of 2020 so depending on the SOL price   gas price the amount of SOL in transaction fees could vary 3  Huge news shortly so I dont want to spoil any surprises  Our next big feature is a completely graphical dashboard that any game developer can utilize to create NFTs on Solana  We ll make sure to post it here so that the community can give it a try Welcome to the blockchain  Im a big KIN supporter and they are also moving to solana  I think there is something special brewing with all these great companies coming together on the fastest blockchain in the world 1  What other chains did you try   research before Solana 2  How many  SOL do you need to hold to run Stardust 3  Roadmap for 2020   2021

advance already CMC has some internal technical issues with reading the correct data https   www coingecko com en coins solanaIs up to date Solana performance getting better day by day since launching Presale price   0 2390  of tokens bought presale by VCs  Ready to be dumped in December when all tokens unlock Yeah Keeps going higher and some heavy partnerships to top it as well Kin is migrating to the solana blockchain  It is a stellar based blcokchain now but is having so many transactions and partners wanting to join that the chain now cant handle the transaction volume so they are switching to solana to help on board more partners 0 06 is what they paid   0 23 was public offering in March  Anybody holding SOL at these levels with the seed investors who bought at  0 06 unlocking next quarter deserves to lose money for not doing their due diligence  There is no real support above  1  Even if there was  it would not be able to stop a dump from the seed investors who bought at  0 06  Solana is great but  0 50  1 is a fair price until the tokens unlock and dump I doubt it  since around the end of the year  90  of the supply will be released to the public tanking the price of the coin Commented something similar on your old chart  What you describe here seems to be becoming a daily pattern  ATH followed my consolidation  Obviously that can t last forever  but one can dream thanks  i m registered  doesn t seem like i can buy SOL via USD  do i have to first buy BTC before I can exchange it for SOL It s been really exciting to watch  Seems to be forming a daily pattern

cents for Sol  so these VCs have already made 100x on their initial investment Anytime Thanks for the info m8 Great u LeeDgreat    Thanks a lot for sharing this I am new and naive  Where are you seeing this SOL   It reached and established its new All Time High price of 34 157sats or  3 9 USDT upon breaking out from the previous consolidation phase of the market yesterday Currently  it is forming another consolidation range up here for a probability of continuing the price moving higher  On the other hand  a trend reversal to retrace a bit before continuing its bullish trend  Therefore  I plotted new Fib circles to adjust the range and possibly find the next price targets that it may reach to act as support or resistance  Let s wait for this consolidation to finish and see where the price direction is heading In that case better to wait what is going to happen than missing the opportunity  Almost all traders and investors who bought Sol less than  2 are happy Yeah  you re right there  that actually happened and it sets a new high  Cheers Lmao bro the diluted marketcap for Solana is already  2 billion  for a token that doesn t even have a mainnet yet  Even if this pumps  it s reckless to go in And mother of all pumps before realising the mainet Total supply isn t fixed it is inflationary  gt The network is expected to launch with an annual inflation rate around 15   set to

solana com implemented proposals ed_overview ed_validation_client_economics ed_vce_overview Looks like it s calculated separately and is continuous  gt These protocol based rewards  to be distributed to participating validation and replication clients  are to be a result of a global supply inflation rate  calculated per Solana epoch and distributed amongst the active validator set  As discussed further below  the per annum inflation rate is based on a pre determined disinflationary schedule  This provides the network with monetary supply predictability which supports long term economic stability and security  https   docs solana com implemented proposals ed _overview ed _overview  https   docs solana com implemented proposals ed_overview ed_overview  amp  x200B  gt The network is

inflation continuous or does it end    Continues forever to pay validators You forget the part where 90  of the tokens are presale owned by VCs and ready to be dumped in December when tokens unlock You guys will be holding the mother of all bags this  Hard to imagine any other scenario with that sort of token influx  esp if people are seeing 15 20x  returns like they would if current prices

2020-10-27,1.68546624,1.74540288,1.60528662,If you think they are scammers them move on  Your not going to change anyone s opinion just cause someone may feel sorry for you  I dont   Its all your problem  Move on and quit whining about your issues  There s nobody forcing you to be a part of kin so if they are scammers to you then move on Had you read their white paper  At 2017  we all already knew the limits of Ethereum  And the scaling solutions were discussed at the time  Kin  or Kik  already knew the issue before raising money  And they promised to solve that in their ICO white paper  After grab the money  they dumped all the collected ether  They SCAMMED the Ethereum community  There is no excuse at all  They are literally SCAMMERS Kik doesn t own 90  of the token  they hold 30   which is pretty insane IMO  the other 60  was for the KRE  Kin Rewards Engine  that rewards developers I second this  The only thing that I wish is that they had been upfront about the SEC from the start  However  I can see how maybe they thought it would be better to announce that they were in the clear after the fact to dampen the blow   it just went different from how they expected Yeah the Kin Foundation Subreddit has thousands of people that would disagree with you  and dozens of app developers among them  Just because Kin has a different use and purpose than other crypto currencies does not make it a scam coin  Besides  it s funny but I ve seen people in their sub making similar accusations about Solana and how they lied about the token supply etc  and how Kim shouldn t attach themselves to a sketchy project lol  Everyone needs to just calm down and do some research besides trashing projects we know very little about  Kin doesn t own 90  of the token  they hold 30   which is pretty insane IMO  the other 60  was for the KRE  Kin Rewards Engine  that rewards developers Thats all FUD1  Its not their fault or problem that ETH was not scalable and able to handle the amount of transactions that come through the block chain or able to handle the data needed on transactions  Innovation takes trial and error  They tried ETH cause at the time it was the best option  then quickly realized that it was going to work  Didn t screw any ETH supporters  invest in ETH not KIN if thats your priority 2  The money raised has went to incredible developments  Its not Kin s fault that they got hit with the lawsuit and had to dig themselves out of the whole  I applaud them for not laying down and fighting back at the SEC 3  They went to stellar cause stellar could handle more transactions than ETH but guess what  they maxed out that block chain too  Their are people and apps sitting on the sidelines right now ready to join in the ecosystem as soon as it can scale so the move to Solana is the only way to make that happen  You say they joined stellar probably just cause they received funding  That s false and if that was true than when Solana pulled their funding they offered to kin  then why is kin still coming over to Solana Wake up and quit FUDDING  Ted and the whole team has a great and stand up reputation  Your just butt hurt so want to take it out on someone either because you have an unhappy life or you lost some money  either way though both scenarios are you fault nobody elses Thats all FUD1  Its not their fault or problem that ETH was not scalable and able to handle the amount of transactions that come through the block chain or able to handle the data needed on transactions  Innovation takes trial and error  They tried ETH cause at the time it was

it out on someone either because you have an unhappy life or you lost some money  either way though both scenarios are you fault nobody elses Interesting view  I suppose I agree with some sentimates there Etherum wasn t fit for the kin model  Many icos held their ico on ether and moved it away Yeah they messed up using the fund raise to bail out kik  In hindsight this wasn t the way to do it   Although it wasn t a malicious act either   I mean if you owned a garage and wanted to build a car  You get a loan for the car part but spent some of that loan on doing up the garage you wouldn t think twice  Turns out you can t do this in ico world  Kik and kin go hand in hand I m not fond of their reward system and 90  token ownership They just want to be able to make crypto availible online   See it as a stepping stone   They are kinda centralised today  However in the future they will need to let go of this grip if they are successful and want to survive Perhaps it might turn out to be a money grab  Time will tell Nothing about SEC  1  They raised ether and promised to build on Ethereum  It is written in their white paper  They fucked all supporters from the Ethereum community  2  The raised money are not used to build Kin but to bail out Kik messenger  3  They moved from Ethereum to Stellar  probably received funding from Stellar  and then moved from Stellar to their own completely centralized Stellar fork  Basically the team has no reputation  does not care about communities  has no respects to decentralization  It s simply a money grab scam  I am sad SEC does not send these people to jail Harsh words  Turns out kin was never a bad actor  Sec was Kin is a useless scam coin  It is the kind of application you don t want on your blockchain That s just a normal part of the market  ups and downs  Just remember to spread your buys out and be patient  If you buy when it s red and prices are down then months years from now you ll look back and be glad you did  It s like Buffet said  you buy when there s blood in the streets   even if it s your own But the price will still go down Mmm gotta love that JSON PARSING for the BPF Loader  Not sure if I m more excited about that or the STAKE  Good stuff
2020-10-28,1.71023239,1.71902702,1.39457221,Dang it   I missed this webinar  is there a place where the video is hosted 3 PM PT happens when this comment is 3 hours and 39 minutes old You can find the live countdown here  https   countle com 1XPJ5m2Bb   I m a bot  if you want to send feedback  please comment below or send a PM Definitely not a scam and the usage that kin will bring to Solana will most definitely help Solana and maybe be what takes them over the top  Solana needs kin as much as kin needs it  Your just FUDDING thats its  To anyone reading this person s messages  just know that kin is a legit currency labeled that by the SEC by the way which makes it one of 3 cryptos in that category along with bitcoin and eth  Their leadership is legit and hard working and their goal is to make a way for the small guys to make a profit on there apps instead of the monopolies taking it all  They are looking out for the small guys in the ecosystem and are onto something incredible Fireside Chat  A Conversation with Robert Leshner  founder of Compound https   app livestorm co solana fireside chat compound  The Future of DeFi   A deep dive into the next wave of decentralized financehttps   app livestorm co solana the future of defi This is the Solana subreddit and I am part of the community  To help this community  I have obligation to warn other people here  While Solana decides not to pay Kin for their migration is indeed a good move  It is also a red flag to the project  Solana communities  please do not fall into this SCAM
2020-10-29,1.49005346,1.56689179,1.41242636,KF is forced into a subpar solution like the KF selling KIN  to buy SOL and then letting devs trade KIN for SOL or replace a future ecosystem Kin payout with SOL instead Otherwise  the developers could beg in the KF subreddit to exchange Kin for SOL   Its a pretty shitty solution TBH What about kin    Maybe all potential partners need to ask that question That is a very big issue that US developers don t have a legal means to acquire SOL  u wmougayar  u ted_on_reddit can you share some light on this please  What this means going forward if the grant is not honoured bij Solano gt Should the Kin community hold a new vote to just fork the Solana blockchain instead of migrating I didn t cover everything in the post above  but the carrot being dangled was the up to 1  of SOL tokens being given the the Kin Foundation   This grant would enable the KF to subsidizing the Kin ecosystem apps with SOL which would ease the migration process by eliminating the transaction fees to the developers  as they would be paid by the KF Now  since Solana did an ICO  and since the SEC and the CTFC both have the view that ICO s in general are illegal security sales  means that there are   ZERO   U S  based exchanges that offer SOL  coupled with the fact that the majority of Kin developers are based in the U S   they have zero legal means of acquiring SOL   I ll repeat for those in the back   WITH SOLANA BACKING OUT OF THE AGREEMENT  THIS LEAVES THE U S  KIN ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPERS WITHOUT A LEGAL MEANS TO ACQUIRE SOL   Several other enticing parts of the migration to Solana were covered in a post I made awhile back    Enjoy   https   www reddit com r KinFoundation comments fhgfrd change_my_mind_solana_is_a_beneficial_step I meantioned Iota before  and they are good supported in Europe even by the authorities  If you look from partners  hedera would be the chain to go for  with that partners on the same blockchain you know that is something for the future yes I like this  and if the funds are missing   they should do a kick starter campaign Just seems like they used the deal to get Kin on Solana and are using the SEC to justify not carrying out their end of the deal  AFTER Kin have confirmed they are moving Someone even asked on the telegram today and a moderator told them to  ask them  Kin    regarding what has happened  you guys pulled out  if anything you should be providing the answers  So far  this is complete bullshit It was a shot in the back of not just kin but crypto in general when that was announced  We want to leave the wild west rep behind and envoke trust in the kin brand and I don t think associating with Solana will be a good strategy that will be in touch with where the ecosystem needs to go   do we need 55k tps right now   i doubt it   visa volume   i personally think the  do nothing  option is the safest option now  especially after being isolated from the space by the SEC  unless there are infrastructure bottlenecks being experienced by apps or a scale of magnitude higher required to survive the current blockchain should be ok  Maybe a further integration with stellar would be better where users and devs can cash out to stablecoin both tether and usdc are available in the stellar network  have stellar got plans to improve their tps  What about the iota or EOS blockchain I wonder what would happen if the community voted again knowing the lack of trustwortyness of the solana management Solana have to respond to this and let the community know their reasoning for reneging on the deal  because it doesn t look good I would like to encourage you to be more cordial about it  but this is not the first instance of something questionable happening with Solana   I have more to say on the subject  but i d like for Solana to step up and speak up about what happened and what they can do to re earn the communities trust in them Solana has a reputation of being shady as fuck  KIN brings more to the table now  I don t even want a re negotiation with Solana  I have a feeling they will find a way to fuck things up again during KIN s upward trajectory  What if the blockchain requires better support than what they are providing  What if they start messing with fee rates that cripple our operations  Too many variables  Solana can not be trusted  I want KIN to find a better alternative  If we have to wait a little bit longer  so be it When they took the action of removing the KIN logo from their website  they blindsided KF and KF s investors  Who the hell wants to get into bed with that Seems pretty poor not sure why anyone would trust this project after everything they have done  Lying to their own community re burning of tokens  Now this  What will be next Obviously the leadership has their reasons   but without sharing them we are left to speculation and it really makes them look bad  I d also love some clarity on the reason for this change  Should the Kin community hold a new vote to just fork the Solana blockchain instead of migrating When  u aeyakovenko pulled the grant they offered the KIN team   this said more about his style of doing business than it did about the KIN project    This isnt the first time he has done some thing like that   He is getting a reputation that his word is not necessarily his word   I hope he reflects on that Thank you very much  Lets get this very clear   I want to ask here to the executives to Solana one question  What has changed with Kin that now made you change your initial deal and declining the grant  Kin brings right now  exactly the same at the table when the deal was made  In fact right now it brings even more to the table with a 5x higher market cap and even more signifcant legal clarity  If the Kin foundation would act in similar way then they should be the ones not getting 1  grant but asking for 2  grant  So will there be negotiations   Was this not a win win situation for both  so if that is true  then I do not understand why the initial staus quo is not applied  It is once again man kinds greed hindering progress Solana is the deal off the table or are you moving forward with it as both parties move into the future I also agree Solano should hold up the original deal including the 1  grant  now that it is clear that Kin today is a digital currency and not a security  If they don t honour the deal the Kin Foundation should look elsewhere  It just wouldn t be a good start  Kin Foundation should be able to trust what Solano says The incentive was also one of the reasons KF and developers decided to migrate to Solana s blockchain  Removing it  even if it was is because of the SEC fine  still needs to be explained to the community and most importantly to the developers They probably just wanted to remove the last layer of hopium for kin hodlers so they d sell their bags cheap before Ted from the kin foundation  made the official announcement that kin was given its  security free  status This also coincided with the confirmation that the move to Solana was still on  The price 10x for a day  So I m some some insider pennies we re made  Plus  any deal Solana offered kin was probably put on the back burner  Just incase there were any repercussions regarding funding  After all  it was a fund raising exercise which got kik into these issues in the first place  So why shout from the rooftops that you ve just acquired more funding from a third party ico   So yes  it s all smoke and mirrors  Everybody wants transparency but the truth is  it s kill or be Killed out there  I mean look at omg     They re attitude to the ico holders is awful  No news  They send out the signals the project has issues and may never come to fruition   The price plummets    Then one day  you can see people are soaking up sell pressure and then they release usdt news and main net launch  Naughty naughty  I think the same will happen alot  Perhaps xrp  They re struggling for security status as well  Expect them to be dragged through fud hell  All xrp holders will give up and sell after months of fail after fail  Then they ll get the backing they need and the price will break out what is a scam is that solana promised SOL for the move and then they retracted that offer I agree  Solana should stick to the original promise now that the SEC thing is out of the way They did something shady before with the token supply and release schedule  now backing away from a previous deal  who knows who they ll do next 1 50 And Network fees are subsidized why As long as Solana wants to be a decentralized and censorship resistant blockchain  they cannot block any project run on them  For example  there many ponzi schemes or scams run on Ethereum  and Ethereum foundation does not block them So   if The Kin Foundation is so obviously scammers why do you think Solana is welcoming them to the blockchain  Even if they aren t giving them SOL to migrate  they are giving them fee less operation on the network  Why would they knowingly do that for a scam coin  I m pretty sure you re misinformed  that or you believe the Solana leadership knows less than you  What am I missing
2020-10-30,1.42893639,1.46731855,1.34221311,Same Yeah    seems like this subreddit is dead   Try other venues for some exposure Don t hold your breath for a response how is that technical possible   I thought the nodes Solana holdes hence they can adjust transactions fees as they like or not We havent reached that point yet  but it would be nice if they could take the time to respond as its almost been 24hrs I know few prominent Crypto business people Personality  I ll do a virulent marketing campaign against Solana and his dirty tactics  You ll see far less people joining them  you can bet on that  Unless they do a u turn on this Dirty business Pretty sure SOL has been dumping without Kin s help  Perhaps that was the price of getting listed on Binance   who even knows  I will say that Kin is not a scam  Just because you dislike something it doesn t make it a scam  Maybe your favorite YouTuber said this and you just swallow whatever garbage he shovels into your mouth It shouldnt be a problem still  since SOL is avail on the project serum dex Then still is still a problem isn t it  u wmougayar You are right it was another community member and was also about the contract with Solano  I just mixed you up  I am sorry  I understood that you weren t certain you would be able to find proof and then wouldn t make it public  I was just curious about your ideas and got mixed up with another member talking about pm Hey  how ve you been  my hero Agora is still batching transactions  which reduce the amount of transaction fees paid if you cant tell  the italicized section is satire  mocking a current political non event and how ridiculous it is can you show me where I said that  because if I did it was an accident and need to correct it Ask Solana   They excluded US developers

comWhen I refreshed coingecko after you said that  more exchanges loaded under the markets tab   I think big exchange was monitoring my reddit comments and knew that I had damning evidence against them    its like that coingecko screen had vanished   I contacted coingecko and they completed the damning investigation in 5 minutes   They went far and beyond  but they found nothing  Those incriminating screen had vanished Coingecko executives were baffled and deeply bothered by this  and so am I How can you say it s a scam when it has gone tru the scrutiny of the U S  gov and only found that they failed to properly register as a security offering Nano  plain and simple  Faster than Solana  and zero fees I had some Sol I decided to sell it due the recent developments of them being shady with the Kin Foundation stuff  I think it s a good project just don t trust the leadership which then makes me not trust have funds tied to this project SOL is on Binance US  this information doesn t seem to be correct  Can you please change this as soon as possible I understood Solano excluded USA citizens from their ICO  This is also the information I find online  How can this still be a problem then KIN is a scam and Solana definitely should not grant this shitty project  If they receive any SOL  they will dump all of them for cash and move to another project very soon  It just happened before It is complete new to me about the legal obtaining Sol   I bet others do not know neither  but when you mentioned it  it makes sense and we knew SOL excluded ICO participants from the US  but with this uncertainty I ask myself why was SOL choosen in the first place or did we   KF just not know I though it works like this sol    gt  agora    gt  kin   in agora you have x amount of Sol   providing kins network with Sol for their transaction fees   where initialy some of the grant was supposed to be stored in agora to enable free transactions  but now with no grant  how is agora having Sol   who is buying it for agora and of course we do not need to pay the nodes   okay understand   This is of course a result lack of funding  why not do a kick starter for KF or they go for an angel wing investor I am not asking you to  then I misunderstood  In an earlier message you said if someone wants to talk further to pm you rather concerned about SOL price  is this due to the issue with KIN foundation or something else  can someone please shed some light on the current price trend in market I have no interest in playing favorites   Just be patient by letting the Solana team focus on layer 1  this allows the Kin team to put those people who work on the layer 1 for Kin to be moved to other parts of the project  at the same amount of yearly budget   IE  they get  more  developers  for the same amount of money thats the complaint   Everything was worked towards working hand in hand with them  and when they back out of the deal  it causes a huge problem I could be wrong here  but agora works like Kins private sidechain  so since they own it  there are no fees associated with it but that is a deal breaker in my eyes and it is more likely that devs   apps will rather not migrate best example would be RAVE still being on Kin2   so why does anyone believe they would more or migrate  Imagine just 1 2 top tier apps drop out because the dificult SOL obtaining part Can you pm me this reason  I won t share it public I will leave that to you if you can find the evidence well would not be the first time man power was invested in the right direction  take orbs  eth  stellar   or do you see the 100 ppl in Israel still working  The question I always asked myself  why do not tune the kinblockchain into kin blockchain 2 0 getting rid of the scalability issue  to then market it and invite other projects to use the kin blockchain as a layer You have to tag him u wmougayar and you did not mention  it is totally unclear how the funding   subsidizing of agora for the transaction fees work  and how long the funding can and will last There is more to the story  but speculation wise  Theres a good reason and it makes a ton of sense   but im still trying to find the source  as I am attempting to provide as much evidence as possible Then why was there no contract  You can t put in 5 months of time without a contract in place Your story is one shared by many in the Kin Subreddit   Thats what is so disgusting about this is that our community embraced Solana  because they were chasing Kin   Then  all the work our devs did for 5 months to make the transition happen was ruined when they broke their promise  causing ripples of damage not just to Solana reputation  but also for the Kin ecosystem developers who cannot legally obtain Kin on their own because they were reliant on the grant given to Kin Foundation I started following Solana because of the initial leak and disclosure of the deal between Kin and Sol  My thesis was that Sol would gain significant credibility for their POH approach if it could demonstrate the real world transaction volumes provided by Kin  This would provide a very real win win for both Kin and Sol  Based on this I increased my position in Kin and bought into Sol  From the outside looking in  it does seem as though Sol has acted in bad faith and not lived up to the spirit of the agreement that they had with Kin  That said  I sincerely hope that there is something going on behind closed doors that explains everything that has transpired  My concern is that Kin has fought so hard to establish clarity  This issue with Sol only  once again  adds to the uncertainty around the project  For Sol  having the most active blockchain will be a marketing coup  I could only hope that Kin and Sol can find an equitable solution and come with a unified statement on what their future together looks like I liken this to a startup company who provides stock options to a founding employee  The employee feels invested and works hard to raise the value  When the company becomes valuable faster than they originally thought  they now decide the stock options given to that employee was too rich and tries to decide to fire the employee before he reaches his vesting period so he can t exercise his options Actually  i don t know any real companies that would do this in real life  Solana would be a first that would fit in this camp That s just shameful  I wonder if he had this plan from Day 1 of engaging with Kin hoping to use them for publicity and also hope they fail  It feels like he rushed to reneg the deal before the settlement gave clarity that it no longer is a security Ethics  This is a simple matter of ethics Much respect to Kin for months of effort  but let s seriously get off this wagon as soon as possible  Blockchains can be replicated  Kin s vision and ideas are too good for this s  t A SEC investigation is possible OK thanks for the heads up gt Then one day  you can see people are soaking up sell pressure and then they release usdt news and main net launch  Then KIN s team needs to move on     William  not sure if he ll see this     start making calls and we ll move to another blockchain   William contact me here via Reddit and lets get this ball rolling If there is no contract involved then they can do whatever they want and the people at KIN made a bad deal most likely cause they thought they had no negotiating leverage      I don t know   We live an learn and move on to a high throughput blockchain and sign a contract if need be Please PM me if anyone wants to speak in private I haven t kept abreast of this issue but if so I say we walk away if possible gt I want to ask here to the executives to Solana one question  What has changed with Kin that now made you change your initial deal and declining the grant Agreed   If they have legitimate concerns we air them out here if not why can t KIN move onto xDai or eventually ETH 2 0 next summer   Maybe IM missing pieces of the puzzle Why the hell would he do so to begin with     KIN is NOT a security   Plain and simple    The courts decided this   I would understand if the courts said KIN was a security   Aeyakovenko the exact opposite of what he s logically supposed to do   Point being  why are we doing business with them  then   We waited 2 years and fumbled the ball countless times but ended up winning the end game  miraculously   Lets NOT do it again by jumping into bad relationship aka Solana   WE CAN WAIT until we find a partner   Lets NOT fck this up  In the end  this is major red flag with Solana and I vote to move to another high throughput blockchain    xDai is supposed to be better   If I m missing pieces of the puzzle not understanding the smaller pieces involved in this serious hic up with Solana  then I apologize They are built to handle upgrades forever   They rely on Moores Law to stay afloat as a fast blockchain see other comments as to why we cant   TLDR  Kin spent 5  months of their developers time working towards a migration to Solana   Not using them puts us 5 months behind schedule FULL STOP   We need to put the migration on hold till we find a blockchain that s kosher without an ICO as someone had mentioned that the SEC could go after Solana   Id think that would be a pretty big deal   Solana doesn t wants to break the  gentlemen s deal  then we move onto green pastures     AND the next time it s put into a contract Then WHY in the hell are we moving to Solana        We need to move to a blockchain that did not have an ICO Solano is a no no at this point  I bet they won t be able to handle Kins transactions  Is there anything out there than can actually handle Kins transactions

There probably was a contract  but every contract has certain clausules  With losing against the SEC Solana probably used the clausule to get out of the deal I think you mean Solana used a cleasule in the contract to get out of the deal when the Kin Foundation lost to the SEC Kin brought more users than those chains combined could handle together  that s why we need a scalable blockchain It probably was put into a contract  but most contracts have certain clausules  Because of the SEC loss they could use that clausule to get out of the original deal  I can understand that if you think there is a risk Kin will get a cease and desist order  But with the current situation it s logical and fair to correct that and honour the original deal audius so true I did the same Look this dum dum

discord  just asking why they are not restoring the original deal There s a lot we don t know  but going forward without negotiating the grant now isn t a smart move  We either demand Solana to keep their promises now before migration  or go find another blockchain and better deal  Leaving it to be discussed after the migration leaves us in a weak spot  Be like   hey we have gazillions of users just like we said   They d be like  yeah  we have the a scalable blockchain  the infrastructure and you re not the only token in here  We think its already a win win  since your fork of stellar didn t pan out   tks Its clear Solana doesn t care anymore about partners once they snagged the known market manipulator SBF and his crown jewel project Serum   Serum is now Solana and Solana is now Serum   All other projects are dead to them since they are wasting valuable block resources that could be dedicated to Serum instead If Solana is shady  then fuck off  Don t beg like a dog here I m a bot   bleep    bloop   Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit     r kinfoundation   An open letter to the Solana Community and leadership  https   www reddit com r KinFoundation comments jm1ad7 an_open_letter_to_the_solana_community_and   amp nbsp    If you follow any of the above links  please respect the rules of reddit and don t vote in the other threads       Info   r TotesMessenger       Contact   message compose to  r TotesMessenger Maybe it s something like this    KF and SOL reach out for a 1  grant deal  SOL for X reason said   no more grant  KF isn t happy but proceeds with the migration  KF numbers under SOL blockchain skyrocket over time  KF reach out to SOL   how about we negotiate a new grant   or we will start looking for another blockchainPoint here is maybe KF would be in a better position to negotiate once they prove to SOL that they add lots of value to them  Once KF proves itself to the SOL team  that would look so bad if KIN leaves SOL claiming the blockchain isn t good enough for KIN Or maybe there s a lot of things we don t know  That thing is so shady it s hard to believe KF didn t think about something The only joke here is you  son  You sound like a very uninformed and ignorant individual  Your grievances with KIN have no foundation to stand on  The only thing I see is a pathetic individual trying to protect his her investment at whatever cost  Beggars  Please  That s quite some mental gymnastics you re doing I had some Sol and exchanged it for Kin Did Kin bring users to Ethereum  No  Did Kin bring users to Stellar  No  All promises from Kin are joke  The team has no integrity Agree You pathetic beggar  Why don t you just fuck off if you think Solana is shady  Kin already raised hundred million dollars and still begging around  There is no reason to give them any money  even a penny is not worth Sol may be fast and I think it is good for Kin  but with their business track record thus far  I m glad Kin will be blockchain agnostic in the future Kin is about family and community  We are about working as a team and making sure everyone wins together  I find it concerning that there is so much bad blood between these projects  I thought it was going to be a wonderful symbiotic relationship where we worked together to become the leading projects in the crypto space  Kin brings the user base and regulatory clarity  Solana brings the transactions per second  It s clear that the Solana community does not want to be partners with the Kin ecosystem anymore  No reason to fight it  I propose that we just quietly walk away no harm no foul  Let s work with our developers and the Kin Foundation to find a blockchain team community that wants to work with us The only team that looks shady is Solana   by going back on their word the management team will become lepers in the crypto community that is small enough not to forget Kin is about family and community  We are about working as a team and making sure everyone wins together  I find it concerning that there is so much bad blood between these projects  I thought it was going to be a wonderful symbiotic relationship where we worked together to become the leading projects in the crypto space  Kin brings the user base and regulatory clarity  Solana brings the transactions per second  It s clear that the Solana community does not want to be partners with the Kin ecosystem anymore  No reason to fight it  I propose that we just quietly walk away no harm no foul and work with our developers and the Kin Foundation to find a blockchain team and community that wants to work with us Yes  i love what they are doin but what they did with the 11 million SOLD at launch and now what they did with KIN is disgraceful  Specially woth the project that supported them when they had no one Dude ethereum and stellar cant handle kin  We left those blockchains because they are obsolete  We love solana we just hate the greedy move gt I strongly agree the Solana foundation s decision not to pay this shady project Unfortunately  that decision made Solana the shady project  and I know a lot of long time Solana supporters who got rubbed the wrong way  including at least one team member Algorand is good   dont trust on solana team they are bad You mean to tell me that after 1000s of documents submitted to the court by the SEC and to hear an honorable and respectable federal Judge state that there s no fraud involved your opinion bears more weight Now more than ever kin brings more to the table Stellar and ethereum don t meet kin s needs as they are  probably the KF has more data on the stellar capacity than the stellar foundation itself  Even with their limitations stellar and ethereum are proven chains  solana promises to scale but never has been tested in real world  kin has more to lose if something goes wrong All who invested in KIN ico event in 2017 knew this  DYOR  ok And  what KIN brought to Ethereum and Stellar communities  Literally nothing  KIN is a negative player to the blockchain space I believe they did   Remember I m an outsider   But I think they did back out  I suppose from their point of view  it would have made sense perhaps to stand back with a wait and see perspective  amp nbsp I do think that since the SEC cloud cleared  it would be nice for the deal to come back  I would obviously say that since I am interested in Kin succeeding  But I think Kin s success is Solana s too Thanks    One thing that still isn t clear from your message  apart from that last line  did the solana team officially back off from the original deal already  Follow up question  wouldn t it be wise of them to back out from a potentially legally crippling deal Those are serious accusations  how did they  dumped  lumens and ether Solana and all blockchain platforms need projects that can grow the whole ecosystem with them  Definitely not some shit project that grabs ether and dumps immediately  moves to Sellar and  dumps lumens and then move to their own centralized shit chain  If KIN receive any sol  they will dump immediately and then move to their own centralized Solana fork  This is what exactly already happened My post is completely factual  Solana is a protocol like many others out there  Solana needs to grab projects building on top of it or else zero value will be created  Name one consumer product currently built on Solana  Reddit  Haha no I m not trying to change your mindset  however there is an opportunity here to create alot of value built on Solana for what in the long term will feel like a slam dunk Solana is a protocol  there will be many more that come afterwards  The infrastructure layer will only be valuable if people build ontop of it  That is the opportunity  We are not begging  others will likely come along and kin may never need Solana in 6 months  but weather you like it or not  Kin is closer to mainstream consumers apps then Solana and that s the truth  sorry IF I understand it correctly  there was some agreement between Kin and Solana regarding migration  The agreement put some milestones on the Kin Foundation  that awarded the foundation with SOL  over a period  The amount of SOL depended on the number of Monthly Active Users that Kin brought by migrating to Solana Since Kin has millions of users and plenty of big apps interested  this was a pretty good agreement for both parties I m out of the loop on this  can some one fill me in or point to an article Can you please stop begging you shady beggar  KIN is fishy scam and the Solana community will not pay you anything At least could we trust to solana to give us their reasons behind their decision To be fair  their only hurting themselves  We can move to a competing chain  while they ll be stuck with themselves Why would large partners want to build on a blockchain  even if it s top tech  when you can t trust the people running it At the end of the day Solana is as much a winner as Kin Foundation  They tried to make a rat hit but Ted took them by surprise with a settlement of only 5 million dollars  I hope they will backtrack for the interest of both entities Honestly  I still can t believe how weak was this deal  If i m not wrong  the grant was withdraw once Kin Ecosystem voted and aproved the proposal    I wonder what the ressult would be without this grant in the terms  since there were other blockchains where Kin could and can move its ecosystem and large userbase  Anyway  in my opinion  it was not a fair game and it will put in question solana s reputation in the future Come on guys why would you cross us like that  We mean good for solana For starters  I m advising people to build on Algorand instead  if Solana doesn t heed their end of the agreement  Also I have suggested KF reach out to Algorand  to see what kind of deal they can get there  In addition to grant offered by Algorand  they have expert team that are able to advise both apps wanting to build on KIN  but also KF I kind of agree  Kin developer here   I hang around the Solana discord and I must say they re great at answering questions and it s a good community However  this news felt like a kick in the gut to devs  We re all trying to win this together and those funds would have gone to growing the Kin ecosystem  which would directly benefit SOL and solana   E g  funding all those millions of wallets that were going to be created  Hopefully they are willing to come back to the table  since this is a win win scenario Crypto will be bullish then  but that is not bullish for SOL

2020-11-12,2.0021245,2.05029785,1.83172821,Right This Kin is migrating to Solana in December   Although not a big deal now  Kin have just been cleared by the sec as not been a security which means they re ready to push forward to bring a crypto currency to mobile apps and chat apps Huge buzz in kin foundation reddit atm What do you think about Solana running super nodes vs getting other many validators like Spacemesh and ETH2 Have you seen Cosmos  You don t think they re legit with Terra  Kava  and Band Glad to see so much community enthusiasm Excited to support  SOL onboard  https   stealthex io  to sol That s not my point  My point was to receive the valuable information I already received  The  why  is just so we can have a discussion but you fail to understand that If you need to ask you absolutely shouldn t Disclaimer  I ve never owned any SOL  and am mostly holding BTC  irrelevant   ETH  and various ERC20 tokens Solana is definitely better than EOS  Tron  or any of those other centralized attempts to outscale Ethereum  I still don t understand why a developer would chose to build on Solana rather than Ethereum  unless they ve got a lot of SOL they re trying to pump  but if IMO if Ethereum fucks up its 2 0 transition  Solana is going to be looking pretty good IMO Solana looks like the best hedge against Ethereum  I don t really see it succeeding unless something really bad goes down in the Ethereum community and there s a mass exodus  Still  it s a good  cheap buy right now  Higher risk than ETH or BTC  but a pretty high upside if it actually takes off for reals Also interested in the the tokenomics of Solana  Is there somewhere a good analysis available Usdt  usdc serum audio on Solana blockchain This is big things It s honestly fantastic tech  Centralization is still an issue right now as there are only  190 validators  but it s open to whoever wants to run a validator and there s no finite limit  My biggest issue with SOL right now is the token distribution and emissions schedule   It s just really unattractive  Someone correct me if I m wrong  but it looks to me like the community will only ever own 33 9  of the total maximum supply  That s really bad  The other issue is that almost all of that 33 9  goes into circulation in early 2021  heavily diluting the currently circulating supply and leaving early investors holding the bag  Then there s a time lock on 35  of the total supply  Holy shit is 35  a lot when the entire post ICO community only gets 33 9   I might get deleted for saying this  but if you buy right now you pretty much just have to pray that you don t get dumped on  I m going to wait and see how low the price goes in February after the token flood  My target price is  60  TLDR  The nerd in me loves this project to death  but that part of me that s been studying tokenomics since 2017 says the little people accumulating right now are gonna get dumped on I really hope someone in this thread can explain to me why I m wrong If your model can predict any price movement accurately  you already made a lot of money and have no time to post here  All these AI ML prediction models are BS It is highly centralized  just 180 validation and most are owned by their colleague and friends  This violate blockchain decentralized nature I m bullish on team   tech   space but still have wonders about the tokeneconomics  Multicokn of of the backers is very good signal to me  love their work How is it not a blockchain I am expert in low latency system  It is a good such system BUT NOT BLOCKCHAINIf you just want TPS  you should use service from google facebook  It is not decentralized enough  Plus serum wrapper solution is actually has centralized exchange which take all you real coins and give you back casino spl coins  I am early user who join base on guide from FTX SBF Twitter  which is misleading and induce me just create the wallet for the event and not need to keep themIn the end I do not use the wallet but created an enter in FTX      one day I accidentally chosen that entry and loss All my coins  Those wrapper provide later can actually earn them
2020-11-13,1.89913758,2.06111583,1.89913758,Is this the solana s position  I worry that they might change the rent price without proper given notice causing our wallets to be deleted since they seem not to upheld their word We are only asking for deals to be upheld by both parties Fuck off  you disgusting beggar  Don t you have any respect to your benefactor You already got reamed by u 44Dionysus but i ll say it again for those that are uneducated on the matter or ignorant can understand Since  Solana made a deal with Kin for up to 1  of SOL  https   www coindesk com fed up with its fork of stellar kin is looking to move onto solana  that had coverage in websites such as CoinDesk  and then broke the deal  without notice and refusing to comment publicly    does not shine a favorable look on Solana  especially after they have had multiple egregious events happen within their community such as  Solanas own market maker on Binance dumped at ATH to rebuy at a fraction of the price  Solanas circulating supply did not include the tokens that were given to a market maker  Solana burned tokens  but then secretly re minted them later a few days later when no one was looking  Solanas consistent refusal to spend the time to build a block explorer    which enabled them to hide that the circulating supply was actually much higher than previously acknowledged   This information about the circulating supply only came to light once a block explorer was created  and then the block explorer was handicapped by only letting you look at 40  of the chains history That is exactly the answer SOL leaders have provided by their silence and indifference  which is why the OP is asking the question  It s not unreasonable to think that some sort of professional response is in order The answer is all the Kin beggars should fuck off  stop being pathetic beggars  and do something constructive

2020-11-18,2.20218147,2.20592249,2.01269296,Fair enough  They have a lot of good news fairly regularly  but it never reflects on price  Maybe it s down to currently poor managment like you say I like ICX a great deal  I am just trying to discern which smart contract blockchains survive and will be the most profitable  From Simetri   After launching in 2017  ICON made big waves with its promise to  hyper connect the world  with an interoperable network of siloed blockchains for seamless  global value transfers  However  over the following two years ICON has largely failed to realize those promises  with low adoption and a still miniscule ecosystem  A successful roll out of interoperability features could restore the project s stature  but it will still have to compete with a growing field of competitors I m not quite sure what to make of Cosmos and Polkadot in the long run  They certainly are layer one blockchains  but they are more like ports for other blockchains that will do the functional DLT work What s wrong with Icons management Now  solana can be staked at mycointainer check out  https   www mycointainer com assets solana  https   www mycointainer com assets solana Nice list  How about Polkadot
2020-11-19,2.11502868,2.17502241,2.01816579,I love both projects  Banano has by far the best community i even seen   ban 69 Anatoly  good to hear from you  Keep up the good work The smart contract engine is so optimized that we use it for consensus votes   The implication of this is that TPS is meaningful for decentralization   More gpu cpu cores   gt  more TPS   gt  more nodes participating in consensus   gt  more censorship resistance Ah  I didn t see that angle  I like the Nano project  I hope it begins to gain traction No reward in Nanos  case is a well thought out feature It won t work on a network with more computing power needed How long can i get profit when i bought at the price 3 Im a big fan of Solana but how does it have more transactions than eth
2020-11-20,2.07676865,2.23039141,2.05697179,As someone who engages with the community often  I have seen a lot of people concerned about Solana I really hope to see Solana stick to their word  the reputation of Solana s team has been mentioned a few times but I am hoping its just a misunderstanding  Hopefully you can give us some clarity Would be good to get some closure on this  I hope they worked something out Yeah   I guess Kin bringing millions of users to the Solana blockchain isn t grant worthy  But what do I know Really excited to see that empty space where Kin is supposed to be Wowww How come the grant for kin got pulled yeah
2020-11-21,2.09539164,2.49882755,2.04852394,Fast and free  Nano I think it s unbelievable someone still put serious money to this big lie  Solana is just some old centralized technology wrapped like blockchain  It is more like the Chinese upcoming central bank digital currency which maybe faster  but we don t say it is blockchain because it is too centralized  It is actually very easy to have high tps when centralized  So using solana you are just defeating the purpose  They you make a lie that General public throw money to those stupid trillion of useless sol coins gt Kin has maxed stellar Two stellar forks and many projects are on stand by You can think whatever you want lol but its a fact that solana is in mainnet beta and its an opinion that kins transaction volume will dwarf what solana is currently handling  Only time will tell  Kin has maxed stellar so we dont know the true volume and only when we can surpass that max we will know    aka when kin migrates to solana in december Wrong  That s a lie Very true but Solana is in beta still and hasnt actually had their chain tested in real time  Kins transaction volume probably dwarfs what solana is currently handling  I want it to succed and i think it will There are not  plenty of options     similar to Solana  The throughput stands alone  The 2017 ETH killers all flopped  Sure  newer chains will claim to be able to reach 100k 1M TPS at some point in the future  but Solana is the only one actually doing it Please answer all the questions and worries people are bringing up about kin getting the grant pulled I agree with you You sound well educated and thats definitely a statement  backed by facts and research  Thank you sir for your great contribution to society  I ll keep stacking my bags though Wowww amazing News 6B transactions in short time of period   this is amazing Traditional weekly news digest     SOL capitalization    99 million  Trading volume 24h    11 4 million  Solana Ecosystem Bi monthly Recap   The Solana network passed 6 BILLION transactions   Solana is the leader by total transactions on top blockchain platforms    Tour de SOL  Stage 10    Solana community in TOP Blockchain Layer 1 Communities This looks very unfair to me  As someone already stated we voted for this move on certain conditions  Conditions were changed when the move was approved and already in process  So basically KF had no choice since then  I m sorry but who does that  KIN is going to bring millions of users to Solana blockchain  Taking into account nature of KIN ecosystem  every new user is new cost for KF  Grant made sense  removing the grant looks like very childish move and begins partnership with motivation to immediately look to another options  KIN isn t on Solana yet and was tricked by them already  Well  let s use them for a while  Later KF can fork the blockchain or find another one  Who cares about Solana if Agora is in place  There will always be better tech Because Kin is a scam with a group of beggars You may be on to spmething  Im much more impressed with Anatoly as a thinker speaker builder I like what you said but I disagree with  better tech always comes around    I think Solana might have something special  and may be in the process of cementing themselves as a top network for the next 5  years  Would like them to behave better  but they may have the luxury of being dicks and still being succesful What about the Kin grant I shared your message on discord  telegram and twitter  Also shared this text Solana is sharing messages on Twitter about building the ecosystem with grants  How about the Kin grant  Another Kin developer is asking Solana on Reddit the status of de original deal  I hope you will not ignore again  All questions are completely ignored untill now  It doesn t show strong leadership at all  Please fix at least your communication  I can t share links on telegram  So only this text on telegram  but on discord and twitter I shared the link  Thank you for writing this  I hope we get some respons this time  Although I don t expect it anymore I lost the faith that they are going to respond  I am not happy about the migration at all  I do understand that the ecosystem needs to grow and Kin Foundation motives to still move forward  I don t think this will be the last migration if you look at all the facts  The rent on the blockchain  accounts that are being purged  It all looks bad and the Kin Foundation has to subsidize the blockchain to prevent this from happening  Together with the fees for transactions it is just not a healthy base to move forward  it will cost to much and prevent scaling  This migration will be a temporary move without the grant to keep the blockchain working  It won t work Can you sent them a link of this thread Keeping mum on a reneged deal is not a very good look  Reputation is not something any company project should take for granted  Better tech always come around  I m just glad that the Agora is blockchain agnostic  The Kin Ecosystem is not tied to Solana As time goes by  with Anatoly only appearing with SBF on podcasts  its starting to look like Alameda Research is actually the ones in power controlling Solana   We have been appealing to the wrong person the whole time Solana will get a lot of benefits and success from their partnership with the Kin foundation  and vice versa   If that SOL grant will not be given at all  it is fine but the Kin foundation and the KIN community should know about the reasons once and for all from Anatolii and then  both Solana and KF can move on forward together  Clarity will never hurt A lot going on that we don t know about  before migration would be nice to have some sort of statement I may be missing something   Isn t there a single word yet about this  I can t believe that the Kin community voted on a proposal and conditions that have been modified once the process was already approved and in progress Solana is just a blockchain technology that KIN happens to be on  IMO  we should still focus on things from our end  active users spenders earners etc   Once we grow and have demand they will want to keep KIN on solana to which

systems in the world  such as Microsoft  iOS  and Linux  there will be a handful of surviving PRIMARY layer 1 blockchains  There will be company specific blockchains  analogous to our intranets  and there will be many utility blockchains  and there will be numerous payment crypto chains  But there only will be several primary layer 1 blockchain protocols that survive  Which ones will be good investments  however  is another question  Cardano  ADA  is fantastic by almost every measure  but there are 45 billion of them  That may be a bit too diluted to generate any serious ROI   Even

2021-01-01,1.50977505,1.8596563,1.50203819,This thing is going to take a huge dump on 1 7  Anything that suddenly has 100x supply will drop no matter what it is  Also they won t be able to manipulate it once there s 100x supply and everyone tries to sell faster than the next guy   amp  x200B I would sell out if you really have 50k worth but that s just me  I am going to wait until it stabilizes before buying in because I do see some future potential value incredible the truth I totally agree with this  a year that can be said was challenging and hard  but Solana achieved a lot this year great campaigns  activities  agreements among many other things that makes it today one of the great cryptographic projects congratulations And much success for this new year  I know that they will continue to add great achievements and face challenges as they have been doing 2020 was a difficult and challenging year for many  Despite the global challenges  the entire Solana ecosystem flourished and grew exponentially  Overcoming many exigent tasks  Solana saw its most accomplished year to date  Solana Year In Review 2020
2021-01-02,1.84558571,1.98929513,1.72148226,Year 2020 was great for Solana  Solana achieved lots of milestones in shorter period  Plus it listed on lots of exchange s This is really cool    I am sure year 2021 will gona be huge    Partnership with USDT USDC Audio Arweave are huge dude I am a whale ok  but I am exiting  Did you see the 3 min graph  They are propping it up hard for the upcoming unlock hoping for a short squeeze  this is such a joke  If you look at this forum  it has 0 acitivty  but yet you have 30 million daily volume  Further more  if you look at the way they are buying  its super sus  Ppl are buying 1 SOL at a time just to pump up the price  How this game plays is that Solana is now a shit project  and they have to make sure their investors dont lose money  So they are using the last remaining funds to prop up the price for investors to sell I don t agree the investors would devalue their own coin by mass selling  Most likely they ll work something out amongst themselves to sell slowly Well I feel stupid for getting in today Seems really odd that they would do this Yikes thanks for that info https   solana com transparency report 2020 07 pdf  https   solana com transparency report 2020 07 pdf By January 7th  2021  the total unlocked supply will be  457 384 933  excluding inflationary rewards  The exact time is determined by the stake weighted average of dates submitted by validators  amp  x200B Current circulating supply is like less than 50 mil tokens   amp  x200B On 1 7 basically all the tokens that investors originally got get unlocked for sale all at the same time haha  Crazy fire sale incoming for sure  This thing is gonna be like 25 cents per token before it stabilizes they unlock massive amount of supplies  so they pump now  hoping for a short squeeze so that their bosses  investors and others  can dump when it comes 1 7 What happens on the 7th I have been in the industry for a long time  this is way too obvious  I suggest you guys slow down  Nex time pick someone better to pump your coin 100   its funny 10 min after I posted this  it crashed  The pumpers prolly messaged their boss at Solana   should we stop pumping     no continue  and here we go Thanks a ton for this post  I really like the project  the team and their place in current blockchain landscape  I was almost a victim of this pump  Just Bought it  30 mins later saw this post  Sold it back immediately  Would definitely buy for long term once it s back to 30 cents I don t own any Solana at all but I m very interested in the project  Knowing the total circulating supply wouldn t be available until early January  I decided not to invest into the project until that happens  With that said  I was very surprised to see the price pump on Binance just days before the release  While I ll be new to Solana  I m not new to crypto  Expect a massive dump in the coming days  I ll be buying Plenty of investors who bought in during pre sale got Sol for less then  0 20 and as low as  0 02  There will be plenty of selling in a week This is been easily accessible  public information for like 6 months
2021-01-03,1.79990169,2.36498131,1.79990169,ALGO dumped that way because they had a completely fucked price guarantee upfront  It allowed big market makers and hedge funds to bid it up like crazy in the initial auction  dump it on retail  and then claim the price guarantee for themselves a year later when the price was below the auction  Retail was quite literally left holding the bags of an incredibly inflated initial price  where the ALGO team hadn t thought through the dynamics of their price guarantee  or worse  were complicit  SOL on its first run up at listing reached heights of about  0 80  During the dump afterward  the team stabilized the network  and racked up a ton of partnerships  The Serum announcement and DeFi summer was what sent it up to around  5 at the peak  followed by a drop as this unlock drew nearer  With the unlock out of the way  if there is not a significant dump  both SOL and SRM will be pretty unstoppable SOL team got a lot of flack over the last year for lack of transparency  but they came out of the gates with no floor to their auction right in the middle of the COVID lockdowns starting  and got a lot of people very rich who bought in at  0 22 in what seemed like a pretty fair  unmanipulated auction  SOL is now extremely undervalued and the team has done very little to overpump the price  That s why it s 1 10 the marketcap of Polkadot  But that won t last for very long  IMO Hype over KIN completing their migration to SOL Ethereum Fees are killing it LOL Meanwhile on Solana Blockchain it s super fast transaction and very cheap fees

https   github com username Well  look on the bright side  Assuming the price holds  which it should if the dump is already priced in   then increasing the supply by 10x would in turn increase the market cap by 10x  That would put in the top 40 coins  giving it more visibility maybe algo is just not very promising great analysis I m bullish but in no hurry to buy SOL  I will wait until late 2021 2022   With tokens already at 10x the ICO price  it is going to take a long time until we circulate the float and send the price higher   Look at what happened to ALGO even after they were listed on Coinbase   ALGO ICOed in 2019 at  0 60  listed at  3  dumps to  0 10  now trading at  0 42 I would like to see SOL on Kraken OTC Yeah that is an interesting read with a lot of formulas and  tfs Bottom line is the short term is a massive dilution in token supply  Even if 60  are staked theres a 40  hard supply that s coming in Imo 2 cents is a fair price in 3 days and 2 dollars in 10 years I ll caveat this by saying I m not an expert  I m a crypto professional who s been following the project  reading the transparency reports  and have close friends who work at trading desks and have been accumulating SOL 1  The unlock isn t as big as people are making it out to be  Not all of those tokens are entering circulation at once  It s still big  but about half of those tokens are controlled by the Solana Foundation and  unless they plan to release them all at once  will not enter the circulating supply  People sharing that graph from Binance Research think it s going to be the full 442m hitting circulation which is   10 5x current supply  The reality is it will be about 202m hitting circulation  which is   5 3x current supply  It s still a lot  but the FUD is a little over the top 2  The market and everyone holding SOL has known about this unlock for almost a year  SOL price has gone as high as  5 and the OTC markets have been incredibly active  SOL has been on almost every OTC Telegram group list for around 8 months  Back around April May  it was trading at a steep 75  discount to spot  Lately it s traded around 5 10  discount  which is pretty normal for any lockup  Basically the weak hands have already been traded out 3  SOL futures on FTX and Binance have been liquid for months  FTX listed SOL futures expiring in March about a month ago  This is earlier than they usually list quarterly futures  Right now they re trading at  1 92  with spot at  1 98  Does it sound like the market is worried about the unlock None of this is investment advice  and I will admit I m heavily biased as I have accumulated the large  large majority of my portfolio in SOL  But I think over the next few days the market will start to take notice of these facts  TheCryptoDog

not what if there s a big dump  but what if there is no big dump  SOL is 1 10th the fully diluted market cap of Polkadot  but has 10x the tech and  in my opinion  better ecosystem growth ahhh yess you

You interpret correctly not the devs  early investors most likely 400M tokens get released on the 7th right  which are immediately tradeable will 400 milllion solana be unlocked on jan 7th or am I just misinterpreting information Whats bitstamp It doesn t what you say  either  Anyone who says they know what the price is gonna do is full of shit  No one can predict future price action  full stop  end of discussion Why aren t the Solana team members and Telegram mods pushing harder to build this Reddit space  Every successful token or coin has a strong Reddit presence where the community can engage with one another and Solana severely lacks that Telegram is just airdrop spam and discord is for developers  where should the community actually grow Until the 7th when the token release murders any gains  Risky business staying completely all in at this moment of truth  Play safe amazing a great year for solana  hope this is much better solana is on the point of going back as in

the market trading around for many months  Just not these markets  And they re sitting with happy drivers that have paid market prices close to the Ferraris in this market  Everyone s just driving Ferraris they paid market price for  The interesting part is that the entire market thinks that Ferraris are about to be 1 10th of their current price  When that doesn t happen I expect that at least some people who were waiting for the sale will buy at market price anyway  With so many projects betting hard on this network and token  lots of deep pockets are dying for exposure to it Your points are well taken though  I don t think anyone wants pump and dumps of old times  I don t think Solana team are doing that though  Look at Polkadot if you want to see a massive artificial pump Yeah i

there will be some info before 7th ah i see what you are saying  No  the emission schedule states that all of these tokens will be released on the 7th of january  However  there is no mention when this will happen exactly  and how the tokens are currently locked up  The team is being suspiciously quiet about this  and its honestly quite a big red flag you can look on binance research for a little more detail regarding the project itself and the total allocation of coins being released So is this just a rumor Because I ve tried and there s no other info out there So how do you know that nope Hi  newcomer here  Is there any source of that to learn a bit more u DigitalInstincts u aeyakovenko Thank you for the updates  Do you know when Solana will fix the extremely slow to sometimes failing  when querying the blockchain for account information  Release 1 4 20 was supposed to fix it  Do you know if that has been implemented If there s one we both know for sure  it s that the market likes to be irrational lol Because something is going to have a downwards trajectory doesn t mean it won t also rise at times  The market is literally controlled by bots and exchanges hunting for liquidations  I ve moved my holdings into another coin and will happy sell back into SOL in a month or so time when the full circulating supply is actually priced in and BTC crashes  whatever comes first aparently that should have been fixed in  https   github com solana labs solana releases tag v1 4 20  https   github com solana labs solana releases tag v1 4 20    There are 87

claims to predict price action Why would any person or group pump any coin  If you don t think early investors are currently pumping Solana to maximise returns when their coins are handed over in a couple days  then that s on you buddy   The current price already has the Jan 7 priced in  LOL Who s pumping it  Why would the pumper pay money buying up current supply only to have the price tank in a couple days  That would make zero sense The current price already has the Jan 7 priced in  unless you re saying the whales are really fucking stupid    Just be honest and say you have no clue what the price will do Anyone who thinks they know what the price is gonna do is full of it  I ll give you the only honest answer here  I don t know The only thing we know is that uncertainty and risk is high right now until this all shakes out 100  mate  It s currently being pumped for the early investor token release in a couple days  Then it s going to dump Is it a bad time to buy in solana Is it a

the exact time  might be a question to ask the Solana Foundation on their Discord  I believe the coins are being released to the investors who purchased them for sub  0 2 prices I could see the price holding somewhat if the inflation plan was coming online too  but that still hasn t been sorted  I m expecting plenty of them to dump straight away and take an easy 10x profit Yes  for some reason there is an issue with the Nano X and Solana currently   I assumed that the X and S would be the same in terms of compatibility  but they aren t damn  would actually love to short this  but looking at the charts you can see clear manipulation so that might not be the best idea Do you happen to know at what time on the 7th they will release  Because afaik the coins are not locked in a smart contract Pretty much  This is a classic pump before the incoming dump  Stay safe Do we know when on january 7th the supply is going to unlock  Is this governed by a smart contract  or is this done manually

2021-01-07,1.93658582,2.61183107,1.93304323,sure did i think it is due to the bull market I ll eat my hat Solana  52 on CMC now  Been trying to tell people here the price might stay the same  but everyone was so convinced of their shorts Yeah  the next days are going to be interesting  I still have my belief that it will go down a lot  but it might be from disbelief lmao This is what people mean when they say something is priced in  The unlocking has been widely known for months  Which means there s no edge to it  Markets change direction when most people involved are wrong That said it could still nuke you never know  No doubt loads of people have been trying to short it Damn i cant believe that it is going up  I put my SOL into nano so i probably good anyway  but damn this makes no sense We ll see if it has legs  Broke up in USD but still a ways from local high in BTC There we go Kinda looks like it s about to moon rn  But would def be cautious  More than anything this behavior is due to the mechanics of leverage  Not investment advice Unlock was roughly 2 hours ago Price action is choppy af  Looks to me like people piling into shorts and being liquidated or having stops triggered  Looks ok tho and the market is trending up I dont think legit selling from early token holders would happen immediately anyways  This kind of movement is pure market mechanics So did the unlock happen  Because the market surely doesn t seem so I expected it to happen automatically as a smart contract  but that was a false assumption I guess Has it happend You were exactly right  Sideways non event  Huge vote of confidence by early investors and validators   52 now Have you tried asking in the Solana telegram Computing the largest is something that needs to be fixed in the explorer   Right now it s just a straight up synchronous call and it times out  that query should just run hourly and be cached imo the token unlock will be a non event and sol price action will mimic the broader marker and likely outperform if the market is trends up  i anticipate volatility because of the uncertainty  i dont anticipate a violent sell off  there s loads of money on the sidelines waiting to see what happens and early token investors have had 5 months to lock in profits by shorting SOL futures  if you invested early  why wait for the unlock to sell when you can front run other sellers by shorting  i expect there are also many traders who have positioned themselves short in anticipation of a sell off  short squeeze anyone  sell the rumor buy the news

2021-02-08,6.70244728,8.05593329,6.4889284,UPDATE  The SOL finally showed up after I contacted Binance support   it took over 3 hours Is the address a deposit address I don t know about you  but when bitcoin is over  44k  pretty much the last thing I m gonna want to do with it is fucking spend it Why you assume that  Everything is on the explorer in here  https   explorer solana com supply  https   explorer solana com supply There is no NEW Coin Release  All Coins Released  January 7  amp  that s it So only validators can vote  Not delegators I ve sent from the address with no trouble  This is my first time transferring back in Have you had any successful transfers to that address before  If so  could be a binance issue with them not updating their front end

error  last night and the day before   solana Transaction was not confirmed in 30 00 seconds  It is unknown if it succeeded or failed Right  but is there a way to visual see earned rewards after the epoch ends  I am not seeing a  rewards  line when you open the address Should get automatically staked with your delegated wallet  no warm up period   Pay outs occur at the end of every epoch  which is intended to be roughly 2 3 days Great to hear all is working well  thanks for updating us should i buy before this event Anyone know if Atomic Wallet will support this Sol Flare is up and running again  Apparently the wallet was under maintenance due to the rewards launch Same thing happened to me  Last week was seamless  but now there s some sort of traffic error  I believe it s do to the launch and a potential solflare lag  You can check the status of your delegation in the solana explorer engine which is the most important piece The only concerning part is i m unable to transfer out of the wallet now  Receiving an  Error   failed to get recent blockhash  failed to fetch  error  Is anyone else also receiving this error How do we view our rewards on Solflare  Also  how often does it pay out I had no problems when I did this last week  Got transferred and staked in a couple minutes Already shows I made 0 278 SOL   2 5 Anyone know if  Binance us  https   Binance us  will offer staking rewards for SOL  I know they do for about 6 other coins I think Binance is authorised in the UK I haven t found anything yet Whoo hoo    I got staked last night  excited for them sweet sweet

any resolution   I just had the same thing happen and found this post The same happened to me   I m a little concerned that my funds seem to have disappeared Thanks    Do you use a wallet to store it  If so   which wallet do you use ive used  ftx us  https   ftx us  as well Having the same issue  I was able to delegate some SOL last week to stake 0  sent funds to a new account stake 1 and when trying to delegate those nothing shows up in the UI  just  No Option  in the drop down box I just staked using the command line interface paper wallet  Here is a great YouTube video from staking facilities  https   m youtube com watch v jg2WQcfAXHoJust keep in mind  if you use a paper wallet  instead of a ledger  when it asks for  lt keypair gt  you put ASK  then you will be prompted to enter your private key for your paper wallet  Let me know if you have any questions about the video That s    not good Someone should make a clear youtube video on this and show how to view your APR  how

bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns solflare and trust   solflare to stake Mainnet is launched  It was launched in March and is successfully working  For your understanding   Yes  we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available  We will keep the suffix  beta  for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in long term and make sure we have a great product  But it s a working network   partners work on this network  Serum DEX running on this blockchain  KIN moves it s users to this network and that is exactly the blockchain the Solana Accelerator team winners use to build on Solana scales transaction throughput without the need for sharding by separating consensus from block production via Proof of History and brings fees close to zero Solana can reach over 50k transactions per second while keeping costs to  10 per 1 million transactions  That is 10   1 million   0 00001   per transaction  Have you checked latest ETH TX fees  It is truly different and powerful Seeing some of the great ideas in Discord  amp  wanna make them reality made me feel so optimist about seeing such new innovative ideas built on Solana blockchain Good luck Devs This subreddit is used for informational purposes only The Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon has commenced   Remember  project submissions are due by March 1st  Project ideas  team formation help  and developer resources to get started building can be found on Github https   github com solana labs defi hackathon No idea  Both BinanceUS and Gate io charge 0 01 SOL to send  That s all I know I understand your point  No stress mate  Good luck to you too Seems to me like a rip off of the Pi Network  imho  Atleast  they  Pi  are transparent about their founders and they have academic credentials in what they re doing You have to allow SSO  Social sign on  via Facebook or share your phone  contact  number  Further on  without you sharing your personal data they re not going to reward any potential  Bee  coins or whatever they call it  Also  it has no mention of who the authority is or the founders are So yes  it does seem like a scam with a MLM model   You can t sign up without a referral  Wish you the best  Your data  your money  your choices  Good luck Also  I feel having 1 verification atleast safeguards more than having none from legitimacy perspective I read this of their website  No  you are only required to verify one of your Facebook accounts  or phone number  or Apple ID at stage 1  Bee Network will require further verification from you when the project has entered next phases You don t have to give out all info if you don t want to I ll have a look as well  But to me it looks safe so far I m just trying to help people diversify mate I am outside of the US so I don t know  but if not  it may be possible with a VPN Spam  someone please delete this thread  it has nothing to do with solana Ftx for non us  ftx us for us  I haven t tried blockfolio but seems alot of people like it I believe your stake would get slashed  not just your rewards  I m just getting started in this too though  so don t take my word as gospel  For specific questions like these  it seems the Solana discord channel is the way to go As an aside  I found this to be useful when choosing validators to stake with  https   www validators app  locale en amp network mainnet amp order stake  https   www validators app  locale en amp network mainnet amp order stake I second Blockfolio  Haven t had any issues withdrawing Interesting  I read the documents but it can be a bit confusing  Slashing will occur when there is downtime or double signing  Does this slashing occur in ur principle stake or in your rewards  Worst case scenario  the validator goes dark and 100  slashing occurs   do you lose all of your stake Meanwhile in binance smart chain  up to 60 000usd in prices Solana s secret sauce is the VDF  verifiable delay function  which is a holy grail in crypto  And solana is a first mover of this technology   ETH and Filecoin are drooling right now Im pretty new to solana too What helped me a lot is this tutorial https   paulx dev blog 2021 01 14 programming on solana an introduction Also hang out in the solana discord But I totally think that solana and blockchain is not the most newbie friendly area for technical reasons  we aren t used to the new abstractions Also in solana  in addition to having to understand the abstractions of on chain programs  aka smart contracts  you have to learn using rust and its novel abstractions Im also a big fan on solana and im also an aspiring developer too   Might see some insights here As I understand it from reading the information on Solana staking page  which you should do too if you haven t already   the risk is that if you stake with a bad actor  any slashing penalties they incur  you ll also incur a portion relative to your stake  They can t just make off with your sol though as I understand it Have you been able to withdraw your crypto  Read some reviews where it has been challenging Im about to stake sol but i dont have ledger nano s  Moonlet might be an alternative for me  i dont like solflare  i might be dns attacked  since its a web wallet I haven t heard anything terrible about it  everyone in the Zilliqa community stakes there  This is my first time personally using it  where are you staking SOL 25 to join the top 10 Is moonlet safe  Ive heard of this wallet a day ago when they announce support for staking Thanks I ve been using Blockfolio  Quick registration and the bank transfers go through quick Bump  trying to stake on moonlet and want some clarity on this as well I did send some Solana the other day into a friend s Exodus wallet and saw that under its ticker there was a message saying   Network error   And I wondered what that was all about  and I ve also heard about the SOL network going down for six hours or so sometime ago  however  my understanding is that Solana is in mainnet BETA  so I expect some issues https   research aimultiple com bee network amp Can you even buy it if you are in the US Hodling is fun 145 100 by 2021YOLO CALLS Thanks  I need some fellow mining brothers  my mine is lonely  Referral is  grimandi  all lower case Staking is going to be the easiest way to contribute  see here  https   docs solana com staking  Here s  a quick short video about solana  https   m youtube com watch v 4dNuMXBjpr0 also staking facilities has some great videos about staking on YouTube  here is a link to their channel  https   m youtube com channel UCDTvEDqqOYLOqtWCYLPIMQQ      cheers and welcome Echoing others here  please tell us what platform you are using and maybe we can help  Solana is not broken Stop with the price talk in every sub Jesus Christ this isn t Wall Street bets I ve started to get interested in crypto just before December  but I thought there were only BTC and I also heard about LTC  which are relatively easier to understand for a new bee  Then I discovered the sea of projects  Solana sounded interesting and promising compared to Ethereum so I bought a few SOL  but yes I still don t understand half the way it  or the other projects  work to be honest  Even with reading  there are too many new concepts to acquire at once  Thank you for your answer The locking time   1 epoch  which is around 2   3 days  more or less  If you want to withdraw you SOL  you ll have to wait for the cooldown time  2   3 days  to pass first  meaning until the next epoch Withdrawing your SOL from any validator can happen anytime you wish  Unstaking won t be INSTANT if that s what you re referring to Choose the ones that proved to be it s 24 7 online  the Fees make a difference of course  but there is a good one i may recommend to you that has 0  Fees so far  Melea   Top 10 Yes mate  warmup should take around  2 3 days  more or less  same as cooldown  It happens every news epoch  your SOL should stake once the new epoch starts  Good luck Maybe the problem is with the exchange you re using not with SOL or the Solana blockchain itself  because it works fine Can you elaborate more what are you talking about Solana isn t a   DEFI    Solana is a blokchain the Dapps can use it to build their Defi  or whatever  on it   no idea what are you talking about Staking helps maintains the Solana blockchain network mate  make it more decentralized  when you stake to 2 or more validators   You can still help SOL by tweeting the good news about it  how scalable  fast  amp  cheap transactions     Dig more about it to know why Solana is better than many blockchains out there  how promising it is Try uphold app the fact that i cannot exchange  sell  or move my solana Any advice for choosing validators What do you mean  Did you have any issues using SOL  I m new to this platform and trying to learn  What are the current issues Thanks for posting  I did end up just using Serum itself to buy some which was prob the best thing anyway  but this is good to know I ve never heard of moonlet   have you tried contacting them directly  They have a  contact us  section on their website  Sorry I can t be much help  Keep us posted

2021-02-17,8.29868913,8.43329825,7.54439928,Humans are going to be a rounding error for tx load  The goal is to be cheap enough for bots and algorithms to trade gt 50k tps will be sufficient for quite a while It s a big pile code  no amount of audits will equal to the network running without failure and surviving edge cases for a few years Imagine Visa suddenly decided that they were going to also facilitate every stock trade in the market as well  along with transfers and payments  Also they would account for all online website traffic that somehow or another causes a transaction  Also as video games merge with the crypto space all online trading would need to be accounted for in real time  The blockchain has a lot more use cases than swiping a card at a POS and therefore basing long term efficiently of the blockchain off of Visa s small piece of the settlement pie is a bit short sighted There is always more hardware  The main thing of what we are doing is that while it s a big pile of work to scale the software to handle 500mbps or 1gbps or 10gbps worth of transactions  it s not a computer science problem  It s just engineering Rollups are basically a compression scheme where the transition from an old state to a new state is done without having to store all the transaction details in between Optimistic rollups rely on other parties validating that the new state was computed correctly  If noone objects with a fraud proof within reasonable the rest assumes the transaction to be valid zkRollup dont require validation  Instead  a mathematical zero knowledge proof is generated that guarantees that only legitimate operations were used to get from old state to new state  without actually storing the individual operations  The proofs can be verified easily but take a while to compute With both rollup technologies less data needs to be stored  so more transactions fit into the blocks Are those transaction numbers comparable  Solana already uses over 1000 tps without any big applications running on top of it  See https   explorer solana comHow will Solana tps grow when having the volume of something like Ethereum running on it  Where is the difference in tps coming from I d say it depends on if your app requires a high frequency of transactions  Thousands and thousands or just the odd transactions here and there High frequency   solanaLow frequency   eth my understanding Solflare is still not supported on windows  Have you looked at moonlet 50k tps will be sufficient for quite a while  Visas entire global network only processes 1 700 tps on average  In fact   global  credit cards transactions process about 11 500 tps  that s every credit card transaction across the globe  Similarly  Paypal only transacts about 300 tps  That means Solana could currently facilitate every credit card transaction and remittance transfer of multiple earths lol The base layer needs to be reasonably functional because there will always be a need for transactions to utilize the Core protocol  moving into out of L2s It s spelled  Ethereum In the same lines what kind of problems does  solana   wormhole   ethereum bridge is solving Eventually even with 50k Tp s with enough adoption the network will still become bottlenecked  I think layer 2 solutions are going to be vital regardless of the blockchain you re using  The base layer only needs to be fast enough to settle with the multiple L2 s quickly  This situation allows for fast tp s and doesn t compromise security  In this regard I think ETH still has an advantage because other blockchains aren t really thinking about L2 yet  Eventually all blockchains are going to face bottlenecks on their base layer and the only option is a L2 or to sacrifice security decentralization of the base layer for faster throughput Arbitrage between shards will always be a problem  having a faster L1 solves that  up to that point Thanks for the info  there are some new terms here for me but that s great   What do you mean by the Mainnet being earned  Would that be the result of a successful audit  adoption  or some other metric  Whatever the case  I m looking forward to that day for Solana  although another poster was saying that the  beta   in   mainnet beta   is only for stability concerns  and that we re essentially out of beta now I gotcha  a work in progress for sure  There are many different UIs for serum  have you checked out dexlab  Here is a dexlist  https   serum academy com en dex list for sure  here s also a ui where you can mint your own or head to github for the source code  https   www spl token ui com Brilliant  thanks   No idea why I didn t find that when searching Yeah solana supports custom tokens  They are called SPL tokens and are essentially the same as erc20 tokens Here s some technical doc on SPL tokens  https   spl solana com token it s about as long as a wait i had really positive outlook for pangolin  nice clean uniswap clone on avalance  low fees  PNG yet to drop on most listing sites  farm nowreason why i dont like serum is because the dex looks trash  and when im putting crypto into defi dexes any hint of poor workmanship for me is a big nonothough being a solana dex is attractive  dont get me wrong  just doesn t fill me with excitement when i goto their dex  and until there re more appealing upgrades i shall not be using investing In long terms make sense  if the plan is going to colonize it the colony would definitely need their own money
2021-02-18,8.23287085,9.27917537,8.23287085,Binance   I used a VPN haha This is awesome  Something I ve been searching for really long Hi Ansi  I deposited in my staking account and delegated back in September  When I check the address on the explorer it shows 83 activation epochs Great   Another listing on big exchange   congratulations team Solana Today s announcement of The Graph s integration with Solana provides another powerful tool for the decentralized Web3 stack  Graphprotocol s indexing of L1s allows developers to access multi chain data without the need to maintain their own indexers Working great so far  just stake with a good validator  set  amp  forget The Staking rewards are updated every Epoch  which is around 2  3 days   So let s us when did you started staking so we give you an approximate time to when the Staking Rewards are shown into your account Solana   SOL  is coming Keep following  bitfinex social channels to discover when  Solana  SOL  will be listed on Bitfinex   and the available pairs Ok  thanks for the answers Not in the explorer  Apparently you can if you have Solana cli Oh ok  it didn t seem like it had changed but I ll keep an eye on it  There isn t a way to find the reward transaction somewhere  right  I ve checked the solana explorer but I couldn t find it The rewards are automatically added to the staking account and delegated  If you look at your staking account  see how much sol you have  If it is more than what you staked originally then you are getting the rewards Any ecosystem is a chicken and egg problem Afaik solana is faster than most L2 on ethereum   and the ethereum bridge makes adoption easy  Early adopters would be power users wanting to do a lot of transactions at a cheap cost  Ie Kin and exchanges  I think something like BAT would make a lot of sense to be on the Solana network  They could instantly transfer the few cents earned   spent on ad impressions  Considering they have millions of users a high throughput network is needed It s for users to benefit from both systems while the solana ecosystem matures As I wasn t sure  I created another delegation account and delegated to another validator  In any case  it s better to delegate to different validators  I hope someone answers this though I m wondering the same  I m guessing from a CLI perspective  you just send the additional SOL you want to delegate to your stake account  then you run the delegate command again  However  im not sure on that one  Can anyone help us I have 10 years  IT software background and looking at Solana like Google Amazon 10 15 years ago  Solana just seems ahead of the competition  If mastercard choses usdc as stablecoin to use then i think this must send Solana very high Maybe I m completely wrong but i do believe it enough to go bullish on Solana   using leverages and will probably join soon staking  Does anybody have experiences with solana staking Beside raw throughput  another problem seems to be persistence of smart contract state  With Eth1 a problem is that the creator of the data only needs to pay for the storage a single time  included in the gas fee for the transaction  but the data needs to be persisted for ever  I see this as the primary reason why block sizes in BTC and ETH are limited  In case of BTC  Lightning network  and ETH  Rollups  they try to creatw tech to reduce the amount of data that needs to be permanently stored by compressing multiple transactions into single one  The BTC approach I feel is poorly designed and IMO  won t scale as it requires a complex network of payment channels that is hard to grow  The ETH rollup approach will help maybe 100 200x I feel  However  even with rollups in place  the data eventually outgrows what is feasible to store on a single node  In case of ETH  sharding will split up the data across multiple nodes  In case of Solana  it seems to be already the case that the data is split up across the network  Solana also seems to have facilities to mark operations as non mutable  which simplifies implementing a distributed caching system to provide data availability   at least if code can be practically written to take advantage of this   But eventually  can any of these  pay once to store data eternally  approaches ever really work  What is Solana s approach to this problem  It s entirely possible I missed something   still learning about Solana In my opinion  PoW is a dead end  The energy consumption is directly related to the market cap  Higher market cap  gt  higher block reward  gt  more mining farms until block reward only slightly above electricity cost  gt  bad for environment  It is only a matter of time until PoW based approaches need to be banned on a regulatory level for this reason alone  On top of it  it leads to scarce markets  Nvidia GPUs  which is a problem economically  Furthermore  the larger the mining farms need to be  the more it centralizes the entire operation  removing the security aspect as well because the few single miners can decide when to double spend etc  It may be a dead end  but PoS will eventually be more secure IMO Other PoW approaches like IOTA also dont convince me as it basically requires users of the network to burn the energy to make transactions  A battery powered IoT device should not need to do any computations more than necessary  such as PoW computations  just to do a tx With Solana  I like that Proof of History only seems to require a single CPUto continuously burn cycles to compute SHA hashes  As long as this is only required to be done by the validator  and not by the end device as well  thats about the only acceptable  PoW  style approach  doing busy computations constantly  that does not grow with market cap  I have to admit though  that the technical intricacies of Solana are still not fully known to me I understand the  performance  selling point of Solana here but what if other platforms come up with a technologies which will make it even faster amp cheaper   Like for example zkSNARKs Dig deeper Instead of being a smart ass  do something for the ecosystem and share you knowledge about the topic Seriously your research is not  deep  enough  Solana already has an answer to this question  Dig deeper Eth is Altavista I had  have the same concerns Though it looks like token price doesn t have to be correlated to transaction costs  Value exists because people think it s important  whether that s Bitcoin or stocks that will never pay dividends or anything else for that matter In general since the introduction of erc20 tokens ethereum has no real use either apart from paying for gas  But if you compare it that way     1 dollar of sol can power way more transactions than 1 dollar of eth  so by that metric it should be more valuable  In general   how I see it is that the more people think a coin is useful   the more they buy it and the more value they give it   SOL has the ability to be way more useful than eth due to the low fees As for the memory issue     every blockchain has this issue once they scale usage and I think that it could be the next big innovation  bottleneck that will need to be solved once adoption is more mainstream lol wrong SOL Yes  that makes sense  If these types of dapps are produced in Solana  there will also be a high demand for SOL  I hope to see some soon  Then  only the size of the blockchain will bother me  Is the Archivers model sustainable in the long run  It will work  Why don t other blockchains use it Good to know Solflare works on Windows  I ve had no problem using it with my Ledger on a Windows machine Transaction costs are extremely low now  If Solana s vision is executed  there will be apps with hundreds of millions of users interacting with Solana and the transaction fees will go up  but hopefully not so much that individual transactions are expensive   If you have hundreds of millions of heavy users of the blockchain  it s unlikely they will all only buy and hold enough to cover their transaction fees  Some will choose to hold it for speculative purposes and  if the blockchain lasts for a long time  it will acquire some  moneyness   You could have made similar criticisms of Ethereum back when gas costs were dirt cheap Serum is driving 1 5 GB s account reads and writes  Which would basically blow up ethereum     Again  the trade off is full embrace of weak subjectivity  just like eth2  and throwing hardware at the problem  not like eth2 PoS security may never equal PoW  So it s really hard to compare   Solana Txs actually have more compute cpu cycles then evm because the byte code we are using is a register based VM  It s  basically  equivalent to x86 in terms of performance Who s the best delegator Transactions  in the blockchain world are a bit misleading    they aren t only  transactions  in the financial sense For example  if you were to have a 100 message long convo with a friend in a messaging dApp  that alone would be 100 transactions  maybe even 200 or 300 if we include read receipts  emoji reactions   currently typing  indicators  etc   You can imagine this number would blow up further on a decentralized version of Reddit  Twitter  etc Right now most dApps on Ethereum are financial  because that return on investment is the only way you can justify the transaction cost  But with a technology like Solana  decentralized messengers  social networks  ecommerce apps  etc become a possibility Sorry  I think I was not clear enough  Let me rephrase It seems that Solana has over 1000 tps with it still not yet being mainstream  Ethereum on the other hand caps out at 15 tps  This big difference suggests that the concept of a  transaction  is different in both networks To do the entire work of an Eth transaction in Solana  would this require multiple Solana transactions  What is the factor here  If 1 Eth tx is equivalent to 100 Sol tx  the improvement with Solana is still remarkable but not an improvement factor of 10k  Likewise  where are the 1000 tps coming from when there is not yet that much trading going on If the entirety of Ethereum would run on Solana  would this be possible today with the 50k Sol tps  or would this require much more engineering as well  Does Solana have feature parity with Ethereum regarding smart contracts etc

you with a clear overview of what is going on and just work  So far what is available for SOL is failing at the basics Why do you think they are  shit    I am rather new in the sphere so I wonder how it could be better  Also  more experienced members may want to develop Other than terrible UI for moonlet  what other bad experiences have you had with them  I just staked through them and it was pretty straightforward Thanks     will keep on eye  on it after the next epoch  Weird that it wouldn t show some sort of transaction with the staking reward on the blockchain explorer though I tried to stake 1 sol on moonlet yesterday and in the summary it still says  activating  as opposed to staked  Is this normal I think the question is though  were you using a Nano X  or a Nano S  My understanding is that on Windows there are  or perhaps were  issues using the Nano X on Solflare  whereas the Nano S is fine  I too am interested to know though if these issues have been resolved because I m in the market for one and might want to go with the X https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs Your total stake increases every epoch  I had the same concern but realized it just adds it to the total The UX on solflare is bad I still have not staked my SOL because the options available where to do that have bad UX or don t seem serious enough To Make Money On Telegram

look into that link as well Feel free to introduce yourself  pitch your project idea  and chat with other hackathon participants on Discord  https   discord com invite gYAEpBJace Solana needs a good

feel an open source  reference standard desktop wallet with all the bells and whistles  is crucial for mass adoption   u aeyakovenko if you see this  can you comment on whether such a wallet is being prioritized or even considered  I found it weird that the official recommendation is a closed source web wallet Agree with the bad UI  needs major improvements  but so far the app has worked smoothly for me  e g  transfer from exchange to wallet  create stake account  and stake crypto   Right now they re in the warm up period   activating   and should hopefully start staking once this epoch ends  And it is my understanding that you do not receive rewards until each epoch ends  Moonlet states in their website 0  commission and up to 30  APY depending on total circulating supply until the end of March  so we ll see if the Rewards tab on moonlet appropriately reflects that I have not tried it but moonlet lets you create an additional stake account as I think this is the only way to add additional stake I agree that staking options need much improvement  Ability to add additional stake easily needs improvement  Forecasts of earnings and payout needs improvement Calling it shit isn t constructive

it Try  https   ftx us trade SOL USD  https   ftx us trade SOL USD FTX is always a great alternative for you Americans More probably from Binance part  yesterday i had my USDT from FTX to Binance take more than 15 minutes to settle in Binance It s always a good idea to see such things from Solana community  like yourself   YES i do agree with what you just said  we need a weekly chat from Mods or Solana team in here from while to while  On the other hand  been so busy developing Solana gives them the right excuse not to be in here as we want to Solana Discoed is always a good place though to get close to the team  amp  ask them what s in your mind It happened  and the price more than doubled that day  The smart sellers who sold at  1 50 thinking the price would crash after the unlock had to buy back    3 realizing their big mistake  The great unlock was done to preserve network security in the future as unlocks risk network security where major holder stakes can suddenly change hands

sure what you didn t understand  You asked me when I started staking  That was back in September  And I thought I wasn t seeing any rewards being added since it was enabled a few weeks ago but I just checked and everything is working as expected    My bad for not noticing the rewards being added to the stake  Thank you for the help Decentralization is the main purpose of bitcoin and

layering on top of ETH layer 1 or 2 as a base settlement layer  Though Solana already has bridges to ETH today  I don t see this as a zero sum game at all  more like a typical market  As a solution developer I could choose the network that best suits my requirements  speed  costs  security  data consistency  etc  and users would decide if they want to migrate the value between difference networks or chains  Meanwhile  my Solana powered project keeps on truckin  with value eb and flowing in and out  So long as my solution creates value for it s users  the chain eventually won t matter  because of a user s ability to swap cross chain thank you ty Sir Binance US   they just announced couple of days ago soon will be listed on Bitfinex You can do it on Binance or FTX Most of the code is in Rust  but afaik you can also use C   The Rust book is one of the best dev ressource ever created and a lot of effort has been put by the community to facilitate onboarding  I would argue the transition is not as difficult as people make it sound like  cf Kraken s excellent recent post about using Rust    As for the Apps  Flutter would probably make more sense  Dart is very easy to learn and you get access to the metal should you ever need in the future  hardware vaults    You ll be productive in Dart in days  the only downside of Dart being de  serializing json  but it probably is better now than it was 2 years ago And secret network solves both I highly encourage you to visit the Discord  Both the dev support and dev ressources channels are very rich in information 1  Legacy   Ethereum was the first blockhain to offer turing complete smart contracts  It was a feat in itself  Absolute performance was not the focus in the beginning  even though it is faster than BTC    2  Politics  Scaling is also a matter of strategy and therefore politics  Ethereum has been plagued by them for some time  Endless Eth 2 0 and scaling debates    It seems Rollups are a way to make governance easier and put the burden of platform evolutions back on devs   3  Tech  Solana uses Proof of History  which is a much faster consensus algo than Eth s PoW and PoS   Some paradigms are different too  like state  data  not being stored by smart contracts on Solana  but in accounts I don t get what you mean mate  are you receiving your Staking Rewards or not An Epoch is   approximate   mate  it may be 2 days  3 days  it depends Serious builders choose Solana for millions of usersEvery Solana partnership  collaboration  and integration   all in one place Please have a look here  https   solana com ecosystemBrowse the Solana ecosystem and select DeFi Here s some technical doc on SPL tokens  https   spl solana com token Didn t FTX exchange activate staking for solana and serum  Maybe I got that wrong tho You could look at KIN  which is already a solana token  Perfectly fitted for an ecosystem of apps like yours  Take a look at Kin org Thank you for your response   I know that with Solana increasing in market value there must be some capital which has been accumulated   I think it would do the Solana community a great service to put the effort into  which often means paying for  really well written and comprehensive documentation   I m not talking about code documentation  I m talking about documenting the fundamental design aspects of the system   I want to know how the pieces all fit together and the cryptographic means by which each ensures the fidelity of transactions   If the protocol is the fundamental description of how Solana works then I guess I m looking for really comprehensive protocol docs   Just a thought  thanks for listening Thanks  There is no farming for the moment Check this out https   www reddit com r solana comments llp9gl custom_tokens_on_solana gnqzigx utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share amp context 3 A majority of this went over my head but one interesting takeaway is that 1 3 of the validators run on Hetzner  I guess we have to hope their employees don t get any funny ideas Zksnarks are not faster  they allow a single prover to aggregate more work   Don t really do anything for latency We guesstimated that holding 2 years of rent is good enough to prevent spam since hardware drops in cost by 50  every two years fair and thoughtful criticism  It s really hard to optimize for latency and performance without increasing complexity  What s been interesting is that we haven t had any major protocol changes in 2 years   Just tons of optimizations in the transmission and execution layers  The chain of transactions and the vote smart contract has basically stayed the same I agree with everything you just said   It s why I got super excited about Bitcoin in 2011 but only bought 3 coins once I realized that the entire design is self limiting in its transaction processing speed which means that it can never serve the purpose that it pretended to serve  which was as an anonymous decentralized form of money   What I unfortunately did not realize at the time was that the market valuation of Bitcoin was not going to be based on its actual fitness for its supposed purpose  but more on speculation and hype   Had I realized that I would be a much richer person than I am now   Solana gets me excited about cryptocurrency in the way that the original Bitcoin whitepaper did back then  but with Solana I see a system that can actually achieve the transaction speed and cost necessary to actually operate as a currency   What I do not know is how much hype is necessary to allow Solana to thrive and whether or not that level of hype will be achieved There are also many aspects of Solana that I wonder about the technical soundness of  mostly because I do not understand Solana   There is no clear  comprehensive  and complete white paper like there was for Bitcoin   I read the Bitcoin whitepaper and could understand everything about it   With Solana there are bits and pieces of generalized algorithms described but most of the technical details are probably just artifacts of how the code happens to be written   That is disappointing to me As a result  I am never quite sure if Solana is working because the current pool of enthusiasts are cooperating to make it work  or if it actually works on its own even when bad actors get involved How long does moonlet take to activate staking  in others experience  Been waiting a day I am pretty new to this stuff too but there is a  rent  concept built into Solana as far as I can tell   This would slowly reduce the number of Lamports in a system account over time  which means that you can t store data forever on the Solana network just by paying once I believe that there is a threshold of Lamports above which rent does not apply   I suspect this because they are still building out maturing the ecosystem and don t want to discourage ownership of SOL   At some point I expect rent would become more significant But someone who knows better  please correct me  as I am basing everything I just said off of my interpretation of text I read from certain command line output and from reasoning about that text   I could easily be completely wrong Do blockchains that support sharding help with this problem
2021-02-21,9.98755024,11.64028854,9.88704665,Yea it s pretty dead in here I bought it on Blockfolio about a month ago For some reason the withdrawal was cancelled  Maybe I didn t approve it over email  Seems like my bad  Was able to withdraw within 15 min with another try  Already staking on Moonlet wooooo 25  apy this is free money It s all good  2 days does seem like a lot  I withdrew a small amount of SOL a couple of days ago and it went through in less than an hour  Never tried their customer support but maybe you should tx ID was blank  must be binance  can t thank you enough If you go to the withdrawals page  you should be able to expand your recent withdrawals to see the transaction id  If the id is blank  then Binance hasn t initiated the transaction yet  If the id is present  it might be a Moonlet issue  use the txn id on a Solana explorer to see if the destination address is correct I can t tell if you re trolling or just don t understand supply and demand I use Exodus and you re right  it does support Solana I agree  I would also like to see the sticky have information on frequently asked questions about staking  where to purchase solana  supported wallets  etc Just do FTX Yeah I think I just don t like centralized exchanges as I don t trust any of them I used Coinbase before to buy USDC at no fee and then moved them out of Coinbase  Closed my Coinbase account  I just used instant exchanges and decentralized exchanges to buy any crypto that I need  If I want to pull out fiat  I could use that fiat to crypto marketplace to send my crypto to escrow and receive funds in my bank account from the buyer of my crypto  All decentralized and done via mobile with a few clicks gt hasn t fundamentally increased in value Except for  ya know  The price going up 1000 Calling binance a  hassle  and then going through that process is pretty lol And 5 times the original float was unlocked  so it could go down 98 I use a peer to peer fiat to crypto exchange like Localcoinswap com  but yes if you want fiat to crypto using a centralized exchange  Binance is one of the ones that does it You literally can t buy Solana with fiat on there The price could go down 80  and still be higher than it was before the unlock I suggest you to contact Binance support Serum  It s decentralized and instant  It is built on top of Solana Finally a better Ethereum alternative You can save yourself the hassle of using Binance or similar  and just use an instant exchange like SimpleSwap io https   phantom app Phantom I would be careful to assume that just because none of those unlocked assets were dumped day 1 that the value shouldn t take a hit by a drastic increase in supply  I really like the Solana technology  but the economics around the token are not favorable for investment uh not sure about that  The support rep didn t mention it  and I had no issues withdrawing USDT before trying it with SOL  I was also able to withdraw SOL without any problems two weeks before withdrawal is disabled on Binance Yes  that s what I did  too  I did notice a  Split  link under the  Withdraw  link when you click on a  Staking Account  when in  Staking   I m  guessing  you can setup one staking account and then split the total number of tokens between different validators  but I m not sure  Regardless  I feel comfortable doing it the way you suggested 2P ORG   P2P Validator    https   p2p org    1 5 8    13 796 314 719 6 69      13 5      7      66 326 875    Vote Account   FKsC411dik9ktS6xPADxs4Fk2SCENvAiuccQHLAPndvk    Identity   DWvDTSh3qfn88UoQTEKRV2JnLt5jtJAVoiCo3ivtMwXP    Website   https   p2p org Who is your validator  I recently staked with moonlet and waiting for this epoch to end to see how much rewards I ll be getting I think that it wasn t until recently  1 or 2 weeks ago  Solana allowed earning rewards for staking  Previously it had not  Not sure this has anything to do with why youre not seeing any rewards It failed during the night  The label was saying the network was busy  I tried again next morning and it went through Did you solve your problem  My transaction is pending for 24 hours by now  Contacted that wonderfull support of binance but no reply so far I think you have to wait and contact binance support after some time again If you have some analysis that shows that solanas fundamental value is lower than otherwise thought  feel free to show it  There s no reason for that to be the case when so many projects already run on solana and it s demonstrated it s value time and time again

Sol in an exchange but would recommend against it as you don t own keys  Alternatively  if you re looking to stake your Sol you can try Solflare or moonlet  Here is a very helpful website https   docs solana com stakingEssentially you delegate your Sol to validators  These validators in turn help run the network and in return you get rewarded with Sol  I currently use moonlet  theyre offering 0

 the Solana Foundation will be releasing a bi weekly ecosystem update highlighting the vast array of projects using the Solana blockchain  Among these projects include unique wallet solutions

your words  Lol  I just want to buy and hold  Is that staking Are you trying to stake your sol or swap in serum dex How does it compare as far as fees Oy vey  I just got started with binance wallet app  Is there something better I should try  It is taking them days just to verify all my info I ve just recently lost my crypto virginity  I have a binance wallet  I bought some bitcoin and have been learning about Solana  With my bitcoin  I just bought it and leave it alone  keeping an eye on the market  Can I do the same with Solana  Can I purchase it and keep it in my binance wallet and just watch it trend as well gt Did your balance increase at the end of the epoch  I also assumed that the token balance would have changed once staking started  but it did not   I started staking this epoch   153 That s dope bro good luck   ‍ ️ Right  it s hard and MetaMask is expensive  Do you have any other platforms connected to your bank  If you set up Blockfolio  for instance  you can send your SOL directly there and then cash out  You could also swap your SOL to usdc usdt through dex projectserum com  using your sollet io wallet  and then send this to Coinbase or Binance and then withdraw it  Blockfolio would be the cheapest IMO because you could stick with SOL and the SOL transfer fees are so low  Good luck It would be nice if they would ever enable the exchange function of

remind me one week lol Thanks You re welcome Thanks  will give them a listen Great thanks man  Also how much would you have to invest to make trading actually worthwhile  Because with the fees it seems as though if you aren t staking a decent amount they will just eat up the profits Man I wan to take this serious  but I m struggling  I promise I m not trying to be a jerk but there is absolutely no comparison between the two and THAT s why you would choose SOL over ETH Think of SOL as ETH ripped on roids  Bigger  better  faster  stronger in every way  It s already getting over 50k tps and that s only going to get faster  The team is smarter and more capable  not to mention more professional  Personally I think Vitalik is an issue for ETH  and industry  growth  Yes the ecosystem isn t built out as much yet and that IS a bit of a hassle  But that s a short term issue I wanted to get a few bucks out of ETH just today and tried to transfer about  350 on Uniswap  Gas price   150  Good luck with that network I m currently using moonlet  Pretty straightforward to create stake account and start staking  I  believe the current epoch will end in the next 24hrs and will be receiving my first set of rewards  The UI unfortunately is not very appealing  It definitely needs an upgrade to its aesthetics  but so far it has been working out for me Exodus is a desktop wallet and it supports Solana Well I m not sure if you re absolutely determined to get SOL over there by way of not going through any centralized exchange  but if so  I m not sure how you d do that  Perhaps there are other decentralized exchanges that list SOL  but I m not aware of any that don t live on the Solana network and thus require some SPL token to buy it with If you don t have a problem just buying a couple bucks worth of SOL and transferring it to open a new SOL wallet though  I d suggest  FTX US  https   FTX US  if you re in the US  If you re not in the US I m sure there are other options  but this is the best one for US entities IMO Yes  need SOL to start  Otherwise can only receive plain SOL on sollet  Have not tried Solflare but assuming it behaves similarly Solana is much faster than ETH and is scalable  I think ETH is risky because of the inferior technology  while I feel solana is less risky because it is scalable  Solana could be seen as more risky because it hasn t been around as long as ETH  so there has been less time to test the network  hence why the main net is still in beta  Since solana is scalable I plan on hodling and would never trade it to try and buy cheaper Invest at your own risk  and take nothing I say as investment advise   I recommend doing more research on solana and make an informed decision  the solana podcast  episodes  1 and  2 are great

Decentralized exchange    https   projectserum com   https   projectserum com    Sam Bankman Fried is an advisor gt and for Solana opening an account for USDT SPL already seems to require a tiny amount of SOLI can t recall since it was a little while ago now  but are you saying when you try to open a Solana wallet  like sollet or solflare  you need a bit of SOL to start  That does sound vaguely familiar  but if not  you should be able to create a token account on either of those for USDT  transfer it there  it will become a wrapped SPL token to use on the Solana network   and then use Serum  or the DEX on Solflare which runs off Serum I believe  to buy SOL But with regards to decentralization  why when I use the Solana command line client  it talks to one specific host presumably owned and managed by the Solana founding team   Is it even possible for me as an end user to acquire the ledger and verify it locally   If I can t prove sufficient stake will the sources of the ledger   presumably the validators   even talk to me   If I could get them to talk to me  how much data and how many bytes of bandwidth would it take my client to acquire the ledger   And how much bandwidth would I be using locally to stay up to date with the ledger My transfer is still pending it is more than 12hours very frustrating gt solana localnet comand not foundthis command solana

going 20  by the end of March Where do you farm radium with Solana  Only usdt  usdc  and SRM to my knowledge Poh is a trustless clock outside of consensus  Works just like it does in radio  When two towers transmit radio at the same time over the same frequency you get noise   When two miners produce a block at the same time you get forks   In radio you can give each tower a synchronized clock   Crypto needs totally trustless clocks  which is what PoH is This integration marks a major milestone on aleph im s roadmap and ignites many further integrations within Solana ecosystem  including Serum  a leading DEX developed by FTX  amp  Alameda https   medium com aleph im aleph im integrates solana high performance blockchain meets crosschain cloud fbafe4f885ca I believe the main area of concern about Solana that I m aware of  is the coin distribution and the decentralization of it  or lack of Maybe someone can chime in here about those two points that keep coming up everytime I mention Solana to anyone in the space Was it Bc you had to check your email Nevermind  this time it went through  All good now EDIT  the transaction was eventually rejected due to  the network being busy   Ran it again  and it seems like it s again stuck in Processing without a TxID  Oh well  guess it s an issue on Binance s side  Will try contacting them tonight to see why this is happening High on making shitposts too Binance is garbage Consider using and instant exchange like SimpleSwap io if you re just doing a swap and can wait a few minutes  Also  Serum  SRM  is by far the best for Decentralized instant trading  if you are working with Solana foof Great advice all around RIP MY 0 04 BTC Yeah I was going to buy last August but a friend talked me out of it   I lost track of it and ended up having to buy in at  8 25   Kinda sucks   Oh well What do you mean   I acquired some SOL a week or two ago and used the command line client to split it into 6 staking accounts and stake each to a different validator   I chose two from the  top 8  and four from middle and low  tier   at least in terms of   of total stake  validators   Every one have them has paid stake for the two Epochs that I have had the coins staked   They are all paying out in the 13  APR to 14  APR region thus far So my experience has been flawless   Just wondering what specifically you are unhappy with Would be nice if Exodus wallet would support  SOL staking Same Have you tried reaching out to them  Other communities have mentioned they are pretty responsive I would be cautious  It s easy to buy high and end up selling low in times like these  In 2017 I got in and had to wait a year just to get back to even  If it was me I would dollar cost average in to BTC and maybe ETH  Then you could speculate with smaller amounts into other projects  Probably shouldn t put money you need soon into crypto and most people who trade end up making less than if they just held I traded Tether for SOL on  Binance us  https   Binance us   and I m in the US  I didn t do the KYC AML on Binance either  as I m not fiat approved  Just move some Tether onto Binance and do your thing Well if i enter my txid on the blockchain explorer it can t be found  Other transaction have no problems please keep us posted for me too Wondering this too  all the SOL staking options seem like total ass I got in at  6 13  which  honestly  was still a good entry point  But the great unlock FUD claimed many victims  both on the up and the down

 Mine was to stake FYI I think if users couldn t withdraw their SOL it would be all over Twitter and their app page reviews  I m hoping it s just a matter of time or there is something more you need to do I can t stress enough how  FTX us  https   FTX us  is where you need to be in the US  Not only does it take forever to actually get onto Binance  but Binance often wants to lock up your funds for 10 days so you can t withdraw  and also  if you want to deposit SPL tokens into Binance  like WUSDT from the SOL network for instance   you re unable to  On FTX you can  Simply put   Binance us  https   Binance us  is trash  I d stay away from it unless there is something there you have to have and can t find another way to get it No I am trying to leave moonlet but can t withdraw my SOL FTX

probably was able to get the 18  because they re not charging commission through the end of March Also  Ive mentioned in before in previous posts   their app is not great  It does the job but could be so much better  They have a  Rewards  box to track your rewards but nothing shows up  Had to look back how much I had initially staked and then subtract that from how much I currently have in the account  Cumbersome to say the least Are you willing to share how you got 18  APR   I split my stake 6 ways and distributed two among the top 8  two among the next 8  and two among the next 8  because like you I want to help the ecosystem by spreading stake around instead of concentrating it   I am getting consistently in the 13  range across all of my stakes  see my edit to my original post above where I clarified that I made a math error when calculating 9  APR Agree  which is one of the things that bugs me from Solana  Because of that I ve chosen to stake with validators that are not the top 10  I just got   18  APR in this most recent epoch gt The more stake a validator has delegated to them  the more often this validator is chosen to write new transactions to the ledger  The more transactions the validator writes  the more rewards they and their delegators earnWouldn t that incentivise people to delegate to the biggest validators and suppress the decentralisation No issues on my Nano X and Solflare staking Thank you for your response Are you using nano s or x Thank you It works fine  And is very secure  I have also staked my SOL using the ledger wallet alongside Moonlet I d better wait to buy some more then  but it shouldn t be so soon though  Anyway  thanks for the answer Does not work on my Nano S binance is taking forever to verify  going on 3 4 weeks now I used blockfolio but unfortunately the fees are pretty high  When I initially bought Sol there was a 10 15 cent difference in price for each Sol when I would compare it to other exchanges You are correct on both things Like you mentioned  the   APR is dependent on the amount of tokens being staked compared to total circulating supply  The higher the amount of tokens being staked  the reward rate will decrease  I feel like I read somewhere how they determined these changes but I do not remember exactly   I also think there are other variables in place  And for staking rewards   directly from their website    The more stake a validator has delegated to them  the more often this validator is chosen to write new transactions to the ledger  The more transactions the validator writes  the more rewards they and their delegators earn Not 100  sure but I do not think you can add Sol to accounts that are already staking  If you want to pool all of them you d have to undelegate  wait for cooling period to end  create a new staking account  and then delegate all to the new account Uphold As a buyer right before the pump let me tell you my view  Solana promises to be a real eth competitor  In contrast to other projects that claim the same it does it with its own technology  It is not a clone of another project and even more it seems to work  In that regards ray and serum prove you can have real defi and not cheap centralised imitations  Personally I believe sol is shifting places with bnb in the coming weeks Kin Great question  check out https   solana com en ecosystem oxygenIf this doesn t answer your question let me know DEXs are tired of Ethereum congestion and cost  Sol is the top of mind answer to a lot of frustrations  Also with SushiSwap considering expansion to the Solana blockchain  I think it is just the front and center answer  thanks in part to all the Twitter attention Blockfolio Binance us or ftx us when solana dump  buy bitcoin https   binance us Your right I am going to open an account with them because I tried to transfer USDC from Binance to Sollet and bonfida wallet but that isn t a straight forward transaction either  The other way I think is possible is to trade some sol for other tokens in bonfida dex  That looks like the only good way to do it if your coming from Binance I think it s combination of things creating strong network effect   Solana is experiencing positive and strong sentiment in Twitter  Serum DEX and Raydium   gt  Products that are actually useful  Hope the UIs get better   FTX CEX is growing and supporting Solana s growth  just like Binance and BSC   Big organizations like Circle USDC adopting the network   gt  utility  The obvious   gt  Actually fast tech with small fees Thanks for the response  Daily or weekly chat pinned on top of the sub just like in r CryptoCurrency or many other subs You got it  good luck I tend to agree  This is why I bought Solana in the first place  For anyone buy whales  gas prices are horrendous  Knowing that a bunch of people were going to be piling into crypto now for a whole host of different reasons  it was only a matter of time until people started realizing this This also makes Solana fit only for high value applications  which makes perfect sense for the defi ecosystem being built around it  Solana seems to win in the medium term  the long term is very far off to know This would imply that the market is rational  I have a hard time believing anything I see is rational given my experience in the space Exodus mobile wallet is working well No storage rent though ha you are getting the worst answers you totally can buy and hold you can also make interest on your SOL if you do one more thing with them   This is similar to  you can keep cash in your wallet but you get interest in a savings account Over time you can earn 20  more SOL than you have now   and it pays out about every two days If you want to make the interest  you have to stake them   thats where solflare and other long explanations come into play   and of course this isn t a bank  this is crypto   feel free to learn more about it if you want your extra percentages Alternatively  this could also be a user driven initiative instead of a Mod driven initiative  What s to stop me from choosing a topic and making a daily chat tomorrow  All we need is user consensus If true  then a Solana dump is coming I think it takes a few days epoches     my status is  staked  but did not receive any rewards till now Love love love Solana  but it likely was a chosen lifeboat for those who coordinated the BTC dump  BTC   gt  Lifeboat  lifeboat goes up 50    gt  BTC at a 20  discount   lifeboat gains  Rinse and repeat Will Solana have any application in the development of mold resistant cheese Its still early days in this space but your argument has merit   John Pfeffer published a detailed evaluation of this concept over 3 years ago and it still rings true to some degree today  You can find a link to the full article here  definitely worth a read  https   medium com john pfeffer an institutional investors take on cryptoassets 690421158904  https   medium com john pfeffer an institutional investors take on cryptoassets 690421158904 That said  there are many people disagree with his perspective  Some coins may retain some degree of value above the marginal cost of computing and  keeping the lights on   Some value may accrue to Defi apps that run on top of the l1 platforms  it s all unclear at this point Regarding DOT  there s a large  Defi and related ecosystem that will likely roll out by this summer as the parachain auctions begin and I expect they ll take large share of ETH projects  Hopefully DOT price will pop too  I m 90  BTC and may sell some of my non BTC holdings into a large run up of alt coins  Then the question becomes what to do with the fiat money I make from selling  Perhaps buy stable coins and earn interest on them on a Defi exchange mmhmm very great news

general frustration with a slow responding system  Solana can process 4 000x more transactions per second than  ETH  Second   30 40  in gas for 1 slow transaction on  ETH   only whales can trade  It does not work for everyone Oh  that s nice  I tried to do it with USDT directly as I was not sure if  ETH  means real ETH or wrapped ETH SPL  This guide makes it much more clear  Thanks a lot Check out uphold through the brave browser   I purchased sol through them and they have a wallet ray I transferred SOL  RAY and USDC directly from FTX  much easier The only nuance is that PoW hashpower increases because of the userbase  It s just not clear if PoS censorship resistance is good enough What are some of the facts you are looking for I got this image from https   www coinparticle com I wonder if it s a consequence of the dip  As crypto drops people start to move crypto to sell  gas prices spike  ppl can t sell or pay a lot to sell  general frustration with a slow responding system  Now crypto begins to recover  the former sellers are buying back in  Having experinced such difficultly in selling perhaps they will look for an alternative to eth base crypto  something that can allow for fast transfers and low costs   donno  my thoughts  still new to crypto world so may be I m wrong You can buy  Sol on Binance  That is where I purchased the bulk of my  Sol initially    But if you are planning on buying and holding   they you really should consider staking and learn how to use Solflare or another wallet gt PoS is as forkable as the user base I assume you mean the fork will have a new genesis block as I don t know if there s a point to retaining the previous coin distribution  If so  and these forks become commonplace  then investing in native tokens doesn t seem like a great idea Good question and I would like to hear others views My portfolio is all red  except for Solana  Starting to dip a little with the rest of the market at this time   I assumed it was partly due to the release of Raydium  There are some constituents that a blockchain needs for defi and it s all falling into place  I often look to find a source for where developer dollars are headed  and if someone has one   please post I also think the other reason is valuation  Solana has a fully diluted market cap of  6 4B at this time  Compare that to the other non Eth Chains like Cardano or Polkadot  not discussing any technical metrics PoW has some really unique characteristics  Your btc is as forkable as all the thermodynamic energy that went into all future blocks  PoS is as forkable as the user base PoH allows us to run at the same efficiency as tdma  so we can price txs at the cost bandwidth  Today it s  50 per terabyte per validator Was looking though some stuff and if you open a wallet with  sollet io  https   sollet io  it ll let you send eth  needs to be in metamask to use this function  to it to convert to sol  So that should have you covered  Once you get some sol in there you can also then create other token accounts for things like usdt etc if you want to send that over as well  https   serum academy com en serum dex sol wallet   https   serum academy com en serum dex sol wallet Agreed   Easy topics would be new dev  discussion of the growth   transactions  etc Check out Algorand  They have thought of this and are actively keeping prices at bay through staking until the pool runs dry 2027 2030    Unbelievable tech and team  Sleeping giant  Worth the look That timing Any explanation for why sol was up so much today  while everything else was down On Jah 350 Yo how much money should i shove into solana I think in your case just leave it on Binance  If you withdraw to your own wallet and lose your passwords you re screwed  Forgetting your password to Binance is simple as chatting with support A daily chat    It s in the title  Anatoly I have the same question  Did yours resolve What would you guys like to see Is Coinbase planning to list Solana  Any updates Do any of these support stake ing Facts Yeah this has been asked multiple times already  I can only assume that mods have abandoned this sub  which makes me sad in terms of taking advantage of the exponential growth we are experiencing Solana to the Thanks  I ll need some time to absorb the different info shared  but one more quick question  Serum is up and running as a uniswap decentralized exchange  but is there any lending and borrowing platform on Solana  like Compound or Aave I use exodus  it can have almost all cryptoes  You just send your crypto from the site you bought it from to the specefic wallet  Like for solana there is a special long string of symbols you send it to which will show if you press  recieve Remember that buying an selling on an exchange isn t the same as keeping your money in a wallet You can buy and trade tokens like SOL on different exchanges  like Binance  and then send them to a wallet  There are a lot of wallets that support SOL and many other coins  I like Trust Wallet  for one On the exodus wallet you can exchange eth to sol  thats what i did to get my sol  But its disabled right now tho
2021-02-24,15.2138421,18.14662172,14.86179947,My point by point response a  I discount this one because the code is open source  which is what matters at the end of the day  Documentation is great  but frequently does not match the actual code  Each crypto project is its own bug bounty program for black hat hackers  There is plenty of incentive for them to look for weaknesses in Solana  b Can you point to evidence of  specific endpoints that most users have to go through  c Took a quick look at the code base and did not find any reference to slashing  could you point to the placeholder to which you refer d This one is a concern for me  Their inflation system is complicated and thus difficult to understand  I am concerned that as a venture capital backed project  they will not be able to resist the temptation to print their own money if   when there s a big market for it I think your theory about Bitcoin  when block rewards are gone  is valid for retail users  but if it becomes a settlement system for big institutions then the fee system should work  That said  it does seem like there is probably a more energy efficient way to do this Solana s price action has been quite curious the last few days  It seemed to become uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market on Monday  It makes me wonder if they have hired a promoter to create interest by driving up the price  This was common practice in the early days of the stock market if the book  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator  is to be believed That s the undiluted value  it doesn t factor in vested shares  I don t think it s a useful metric because all the value of Avax will come in the future  so I think you need to primarily measure the marketcap from when the vesting period is up I have used Avalanche a lot  it s not very good  There are only a handful of functioning dapps and it doesn t work well with metamask  The transactions are fast  but they are expensive  There is a long delayed update that is supposed to slash the transaction cost by 95   but for the moment entering a liquidity pool is around 1 5  I haven t used Polkadot or Cardano  Cardano doesn t have smart contracts yet I think  that s coming in the next few months  I think Polkadot does  but on their test network which I haven t bothered playing around with  I was going through their roadmap today and it looks like they are at the final stages of tests before starting to add parachains to their test network  but seems like it will be a few more months before they get up and running Solana has Serum and basically nothing else going at the moment right  I m unsure on why the rest of the ecosystem isn t running yet  haven t looked into it I like you re theory  but Avalanche has a market cap of  just   2 2 billion  which makes it just less than half the size of Solana at this moment  which is  4 5 billion Have you used Avalanche  Polkadot and Cardano  If so how was your experience I know right lol I hear about how low the transaction fees are but that only matters if you actually receive your money Yeah unfortunately there is a select group which holds a significant amount of tokens  One or 2 parties hold about 30 percent when usually 10 percent held by one group is not good What happened Personally loving your conjecture thoughts   Lots of stuff I hadn t thought about Keep it up gt  It s going up continuously right now but I don t know if that s because of clever pumping by whales  overall cryptocurrency hype  or actual interest by a large number of people  I suspect it s a combination of all three but I don t know the exact ratios I think it s going up because of it s market cap compared to the other  Eth Killer  projects  Avalanche  Polkadot and Cardano were all in the 20 35bil valuation  while Solana is down at 5  If those projects are actually worth that much  and I think everything is insanely overvalued  then there isn t much argument Solana isn t worth something similar  none of them are remotely close to what people consider their potential I just keep hearing errors after errors in the Solana ecosystem  what actually works You really do sound foolish and have absolutely no clue to what you are talking about  Fools are the ones that invest in something long term and have no idea on where it s going or if it ll even be something down the line  It is not proven yet so wth are you talking about crying   the only one here crying  amp  mad is you just because someone else does something different than what you do as if you actually own the companythen want to get on a reddit forum and talk like you have a clue  If you don t like what people tell you or post then don t respond and ignore  it  because when you respond mad  amp  crying about what someone said and told you or becausethey gave you a down vote  then you show just how ignorant  amp  sensitive  you are Don t like what you see or hear change the channel  Have fun I m done talking Let s hope she happy with this meat It s growth not whoring       she needed that Solana meat XLM couldn t get it done anymore Almost certain they have jumped from project to project  kin is a bit of a whore Outgrew them transactions per second were not sufficient   migrated to Solana for mass adoption Hasn t kin already been linked with other blockchains in the past  sure they wer partnered with Stella xlm What does this mean for sol holders That was me being polite https   kin org kin and solana foundations sign agreement to support the largest migration in blockchain history What kin Please be polite By the way  I ve been posting alot lately and it s clear that I am not an expert and just posting conjectures and opinions mixed with a little fact   If people think that I am not adding useful text to these discussions with my big walls  just let me know  I will tone it down   Thanks I bought Raydium  think it s great Perhaps but I don t quite understand how your question relates to my post   Not challenging you  just genuinely don t understand   I didn t mention inflation   I know that they have algorithms to keep the circulating and available SOL in a sustainable range   SOL gets burned ever Epoch  I know that  and inflation is built into the system via staking rewards  I do not know how these balance out and if they do not  what keeps SOL count from growing or shrinking Really I am not an expert  I am just posting my opinions and sharing what I think I know in hopes that others will contribute what they  do  know     so please educate me Passive investing is about as much  nothing  as you can possibly do   You have made a trade  your work time for someone else s dollars  and now you want someone else to take the value of your work time and keep giving you free money for it   It is true that deferring your use of the value created by your work  in the form of that money that you are letting someone else use instead of spending yourself  has some value  but it s not much more than a few percent   Anything beyond that is just wishful thinking  and what we are all seeking but do not technically  deserve    and  90  in a week is not enough for me  is just the greed of yet another crypto get rich quick schemer If you want Solana to be worth more  do something actively to make it worth more   Don t just cry in reddit forums and downvote those who tell you how it really is gt EDIT  By the way  just keep in mind that if you don t risk anything  then you cannot hope for any rewards   A few thousands of dollars risk is nothing compared to the potential payoff  but you do have to be prepared to lose some thousands and chalk it up to a moon shot that didn t work if it failsYea  but a few thousand dollars just invested and staked in it doesn t look bad either  D gt I do not know what you mean by  I m in the US  so unfortunately unable to earn foundation rewards    I say that because I actually don t know anything  not because I am challenging what you say   In what way are US citizens hamstrung with regards to the Solana foundation   I sincerely do not know and would appreciate any info you have    US entities are unable to get SOL rewards for participating in their test net initiatives  like TdS for example  so the recommendation to get started there is useless for me unfortunately   You re able to start up a node on the mainnet  but unless you d been doing it for a while or had acquired a large amount of SOL  I don t see a realistic way in if you re an individual in the US  amp  x200B  gt As for me I was thinking that it might be better to go with a low end  possibly very low end  build first and try out a non voting node just to get a feel for what the steps are in setting things up and become familiar with the hardware and software processes I thought about this as well and am mulling it over  Not a bad idea at all  If I recall I think you can get on their testnet to get familiar with it  amp  x200B  gt I think part of the reason that people are likely hesitant to share  however  is that existing validators do not want competition And yes  sadly  this occurred to me as well  I ve been told the discord is very helpful  but I ve found surprisingly little information there as far as this is concerned Certainly if you d gotten in early and were eligible for rewards I could see that  because they do seem to be pretty generous  However  without knowing what the tx fees look like  it s impossible to know if a person in the US who is starting out with very little would want to participate  That s what I want to try to figure out I m pretty sure the majority of the validators are scrappy folks as is evident by the discussions in the discord  However  I assume the ones who got in early benefited by getting more one on one access  auto delegated stake and foundation rewards Yea I actually just built a system that is like halfway there  and am willing to do another  I also am lucky enough to have fiber where I live with symmetric gig speeds  so I think I can def do it  it s just a matter of am I going to spend like  3000  on a whim lol You dropped this           amp  32 To amp  32 prevent amp  32 anymore amp  32 lost

single family home   _ ツ _ Isn t staking their solution to inflation I m also curious  I want to be a part of the project  but it looks like the validator operations are super professional  From the website it looks like they want scrappy folks like me  but that they also don t want scrappy folks like me  I m willing to put together an expensive system if there s any return at all It might be a bit off topic but Kin is the project which seems that can grow massively on Solana  When we speak about internet currency   KIN already has monthly more than million spenders throughout different real world apps  Check KIN site to see spectrum of projects currently running on it and think of future apps potential  There are already real examples of replacing financial system on there  Check this one out  you won t waste your time Are you saying there is no coin limit on SOL  ever Came here to ask this question of this community  One possible explanation would be if Solana was way more likely to be locked in defi contracts so people could not panic sell  Are these types of defi common here Sooo glad I bought solana Hahahaha that s the most foolish comment ever lol  SMH   ‍ ️obviously it s not free money if I m using my own money to invest  I m in it to make money etc just like probably 90  of the  investors   if I don t deserve anything  then you don t deserve anything if you re not in it for the money as well as its capabilities and a better life financially  There is absolutely nothing wrong with making money  at the end of the day that s part  if not all of the reasons why we work  SMH   ‍ ️ If all you re hoping for is money for doing nothing  then you deserve nothing   If you have no patience for the world not giving you your free money as fast as you want it to  then you probably deserve even less than nothing I clicked on the link   You can see the transactions quickly but the  distribution  view just hangs   I don t really know what the distribution view is trying to show   Maybe it s a list of all SOL accounts related to that KIN thing   If so maybe it s too large of a query and the block explorer really should not even promise to be able to display such things when it s not feasable to do so   I don t know I recommend writing to Solana directly with your concern   I think the founders may be too busy getting rich at the moment to notice your post here It was  It was literally provided by raydium and the wallet on the site   The problem occured when it tried to settle the funds after swapping it  it froze and nothing happened the funds were simply just gone Seems so  Now I know to only test the waters and use like a couple dollars at a time before throwing my whole balance forward  I got too excited by the surge in solana and radium prices and lost it all I m aware of that  I had even more problems with the serum dexes honestly  Half of them wouldn t even let me settle the funds I had to delete all the extra accounts I made for different tokens and then it let me settle  But after that  the issue persisted  Solflare dex won t even let me trade and usually I just gotta use the convert or swap of available  Which only works like on 20  of exchanges for me As for the raydium there was none to be settled  It s simply gone it seems I can t get send my SOL out of this piece of shit app Any thoughts on getting into Raydium or Bonfida   ofc not asking for financial advice I haven t done any staking yet  Mostly just bought and held BTC  Started accumulating Solana last fall  Fees on ETH and BTC are crazy right now so I m just using  FTX US  https   FTX US  for everything  Not a huge selection of alt coins  but I m not trying to guess which alt coin is going to skyrocket next The cash app and swan bitcoin make it quite easy to dollar cost average into BTC if you want to go that route I have the same issue  ive tried everything  I think the money is just gone Solflare with Ledger is still the best for self custody Serum and especially Raydium have a lot of work to do on integrations  Even the UI needs a ton of work  They re super new and small compared to their ETH counterparts  But as they grow they will allocate more resources to UI and integrations Just found out on another thread it only partially works   doesn t work on some Solana network participants like Raydium Good to know  I was just setting up a wallet and saved me some time  I won t bother with connecting ledger for now  Do you know where the work needs to be done  On Serum Raydium or on the Ledger SolFlare side In Solana beach  California No  I m not sure where you can buy it in the US  but I do know you can buy it on Serum  If you re going to get involved with Solana  I d suggest checking out Serum  It s pretty simple to get started  Just open a sol wallet   sollet io  https   sollet io  is a good one as you can use it on Serum and Raydium   deposit some sol in it and then you can trade on Serum  You can do swaps there too  so you can swap your sol for usdt or usdc to buy kin  or you can just put a little sol in your wallet and then send usdt or usdc from  FTX us  https   FTX us  to your wallet and go about it that way Room it s up 90  for you maybe so don t tell me to be patient  You go count something Thanks You re welcome Thanks for the response  The TPS is potential is amazing I can t seem to buy kin on ftx us  is it not available Try to contact the support They could see if they can find a solution for you Bro its up over 90  this week be patient Heres an awesome  infographic  https   twitter com coin98analytics status 1364122734855249920 s 10  I found I think Kin may have played a factor in this  Kin was added to a reputable esxhange yesterday and a massive influx of buyers joined in to support the project  I think it gained something like 73  yesterday  Since Kin is runs on Solona  there was a lot of gas needed for all of that to work  I m sure that that s just part of the equation If you go into project Serum s website you can find a list of DEX UI implementations in the documentation   https   serum academy com en dex list   https   serum academy com en dex list   Worth a look if you haven t seen this yet Send USDC directly from FTX US to sollet io wallet on Serum or Raydium Dex and you can trade those coins plus 10  others then easily transfer them out to your wallet FTX US  And if you want Serum as well by USDC on FTX US and send directly the Serum Dex FTX US  Link your bank account up via Plaid and they credit your ACH withdraw so you can trade immediately  They do not have many coins tokens to trade  though I had a similar issue yesterday and went to the telegram for some support I learned that you have to go to the DEX  https   dex raydium io   market HZyhLoyAnfQ72irTdqPdWo2oFL9zzXaBmAqN72iF3sdXAnd settle your balance for the coins you swapped Those exchanges are adding time  Try transferring from a real wallet to another wallet  Transferring between solflare accounts takes a few seconds wow  did you check the price yesterday  I dumped it as well like you before the ATH I m staking with moonlet through SolFlare  I haven t made an epoch yet so don t have a return but possibly it s a better user experience  Although  not sure if the 18  is only available directly via their app Yeah   u No Neighborhood5731 is right       Can I add SOL to an already existing stake account   No  just create a new staking account for each delegation  even if its to the same validator        https   www solflare com     https   www solflare com         see bottom of page FAQ I use solflare too  ideally every time I add sol to a specific wallet address it would just auto stake to my existing staking account I m not sure if that is a feature of the command line tools  it wasn t clear to me   https   docs solana com cli manage stake accounts relocate stake accounts  https   docs solana com cli manage stake accounts relocate stake accounts Double check the withdrawal address is correct They might do it gradually  It would be the clever way to do it for everyone even for themselves For mobile I think ftx is the only good solution for now  Still not progressing on mobile front Should be    it s under SoL Good point  I am interested though in the difference in rewards right now being liquidity pool staking and token staking  I didn t think about how it will likely change dramatically every day for each project  because of the massive incoming trade volume Thanks   I am a Reddit newb That site doesn t mention the paper wallet option   Search for and read about paper wallets in addition to following that link if you d like to get a more complete picture of your options Ahh yeah unfortunately this does seem to be the case I think it will go no higher than  100 per SOL this year  but that it will go to at least  30 per SOL this year By the way  you are aware that there are at least 5 or 6  founders  who started with 5 million SOL right   For those who haven t sold  their theoretical max right now at  16 Sol is  80 million dollars   Ask yourself how long you think those people will hold out before doing anything in their power to bank their money regardless of what it does to the SOL ecosystem   It scares me a bit to be honest Leaving centralized exchanges is the bottleneck that has nothing to do with the Solana blockchain If you use the Solana command line client you are as  close to the bare metal  as possible   You will see the fastest time possible in terms of the completion of a transaction and it appearing validated in the block chain When I use the command line client  I find it takes anywhere from 1 to 10 seconds to finish   I can only conclude that the extra latency you are experiencing is due to those other systems  FTX  Binance  Trust  etc    You might want to contact them to ask them why they are so slow  if 2 minutes is indeed slow  which in my opinion it is not  depending on what is being done Probably not worthwhile to include point 4 at all  Especially for Raydium  as it will change dramatically in the early stages that we are in now 1     Raydium    2   Only compatible with SRM  3  Connects to  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  wallet 4  Does liquidity pool staking in pairs  Currently  only pair available is SRM RDM I know of these 4  Moonlet  Raydium  SolFlare  and Project Serum I meant transferring Solana directly to a wallet  You can do this on Binance  but not Uphold as far as I m aware Thanks  Any info on the reward structure How  I don t see Solana s network in Uphold Thanks for the info   I find you to be a consistently helpful poster Sounds to me like the problem is with these front ends to Solana that are provided by third parties  not Solana itself   If you are going to use a front end system like that then I think you should be prepared to take your problems to them when you have issues I have never used Raydium or Serum  but those two are the services that you are relying on to properly execute your transaction and it sounds like one or both of them failed you   You should contact their support I think I personally have only ever used the Solana command line client and it has never failed me   Sometimes it doesn t complete transactions but it never leaves things in a bad state    the transaction if failed just didn t happen and I submit the command again until it succeeds Sometimes I get a failure from the command line client but then if I check a little later  I find that the transaction has actually been posted to the block chain so it went through and the error from the client was spurious Maybe  and this is just a guess  those services you use are  conservative  in that if any part of the transaction fails  they halt any attempt at completing the transaction until some time period has passed   In that case  I would expect that all is needed is some patience as you want for the transaction to finally succeed   If this is what is happening  and I don t know if it is or not  it s just a theory   then I would recommend that you contact those sites and let them know that you d appreciate more visibility into your transactions  such as being notified if a transaction is pending or failed and retrying or whatever  instead of being told nothing But you know  good user interface takes work and 99  of the crypto ecosystem is get rich quick schemers who don t really care about anything except making money so it doesn t surprise me that they cut corners on things like user experience     sorry I just had to say that     here s hoping Solana is in the 1 Solflare with Ledger works with Solflare DEX  but not with Serum or Raydium Don t forget about your KINfolk that s running on Solana blockchain  KIN up 56  last 24hrs SOL needs to pick up the pace  It was doing so well earlier and now it doesn t want to move  plus volume is dropping off which is part of the reason Yes  and it s still very early for Kin  Buy and hodl  Not financial advice dyor dd There are few to none I think  I was looking last week and didn t find any compelling ones I did the other day Just use uphold Uphold  It s an app and is very easy and quick to set up  If you use a US based credit card  it will charge a foreign transaction fee  Bank account is quick to add and easy to use  They charge no commissions but instead a  spread  depending on the volatility and the coin  You can turn  anything to anything  on uphold  Once you preview trade the price holds  it doesn t change gt Just bought Solana to farm Raydium  what next this is currently on presale  right
2021-02-25,17.23018337,17.69544462,13.79591349,Yeah really try to avoid buying on the way up  but in an accumulation stage  ie sideways  so look for coins that are hovering and volume is increasing  Then sell in profit  Sol will bounce back but will still hover between the moving average    I buy in stages at various levels  Don t time the market  Also I learnt to avoid technical analyses  etc   I just stare at the binance charts and try to understand the tech industry nees  Btw I am picking reef for my moon coin Where do you stack them Please contact Exodus support I bought yesterday too  No biggie if you plan on holding for a long time  I believe any price you buy at right now will pay off very well one day  Don t panic over the ups and downs  Just watch as it has small spikes now and again  I ve decided to buy a little bit every week no matter what the price is for a little bit  Then I ll set back and see where it goes after some time  This is a game of patience  I believe the rewards will be there Price movement doesn t affect it  Your APR yield is in the coins  not in dollar value so an upwards price movement is always good with no downsides I sold 600  worth of ENJ  EnjinCoin  at 0 47  to get myself some nice juicy Solanda at 18 40  or so  so now ENJ is up 30   biggest gainer from all cryptos  while Solana is biggest loser  Ah btw I was holding on to ENJ for 3 5 years  Fml This could be why the price is diving today Why is Solana tanking a bit today  uggh  Bought too high yesterday and paying today lol It doesn t how did u resolve it  I tried sending it to binance and still haven t gotten anything in almost an hour  transaction is no where to be found also How does price movement affect staked assets  Does the yield increase decrease too Honestly it s not THAT complicated and most crypto wallets work the same way  so you wouldn t have to do much differently for another token in the future Alternatively  Binance are now offering SOL staking  slightly lower   rewards than a non custodial wallet but still decent Depends on the transaction  sending is a few cents  joining a liquidity pool or staking is   05 AVAX  which is like 1 5 All of it How much are transaction fees on Avalanche Hey  so I figured it out  the sollet io wallet has an option when you use  send  where you can choose between the SPL or the erc20  Not sure if that same option is possible off ledger Fails to fetch from mainnet api  which is beta  but not showing distribution looks more like a feature then bug  So no frontend issue  much bigger one  Doesn t look good for Solana  I am just doing my research on it    D I dunno but keep in mind that it is a locked stack for 15 day and i am capped to 20 SOL  in the end i will have 0 3 SOL  Maybe they have some free for promoting Seems so  Also  how can they offer this high    is this some advertising thing  There is no way that regular SOL staking on a wallet yield is that high No one cares i guess  Lmao Goes down every second and this is not normal for Solana Is ut capped to 20 SOL for everyone  Couldnt stack more than this Hi  I am also interested in any good reading about how to get USDC on and off Solana ledger  My situation is similar  but in my case I have some USDC on Ethereum chain  and I would like to bring them on Solana chain  Any guidance would be welcome  thank you Thanks for posting this www simpleswap io hmm  so you  converted  some ERC20 KIN to SPL KIN  I suppose you had to pay ETH gas fees to do that   how much When you first did that  what was the  Max  shown available to convert  And did you convert it all  And did it show up in your Main account balance of SPL KIN If you converted it all  then now there would be Max 0 0 ERC20 KIN available to convert And you needed SOL in your  sollet io  https   sollet io  wallet to do that conversion  How much SOL do you have  A few SOL is way more than enough I have this project in my sight since a moment and glaf there a dip so i could jump in Yeah you need to settle every single transaction swap or dex  It s something that will likely happen automatically in the  background in the future Well I was actually using the swap part not the actual DEX with the order book  So that s where my confusion came  It processed the TX But because I hadn t made a specific USDC address in my Sollet wallet it actually held the funds in the settle tab on the DEX like you are saying  I had a hunch that s where they went the next morning so I went and connected to the Ray USDC pool on the DEX and it automatically started settling my USDC once I clicked on the correct pool Oxygen is a DeFi prime brokerage service built on Solana and powered by Serum s on chain infrastructure  Oxygen is built around Pools    Baskets of assets that take collective actions  Starting with a borrow lending facility  users will be able to earn yield and get leverage against their portfolios  setting the foundation for a vibrant and decentralised financial ecosystem Just given it a try  it is really very good Did you get this figured out  It wouldn t of let you complete the transaction without the USDC wallet  Your sollet io wallet likely had one  On any Ray or Serum transaction you need to settle funds afterwards  Did you do this  You just need to click the settle funds button near balances  If that doesn t sort out your problem check explorer to see what address your usdc went to Orca is an AMM aggregator of liquidity pools  designed to provide a simpler  more intuitive experience for traders  built on Solana https

them for you Boom   Bitfinex is in top 5 exchanges with decent volume  Congratulations team Solana I didn t get your question mate  can you elaborate Solana   SOL  is now listed on Bitfinex Trading and withdrawals for  SOL are now available  Solana can be traded with  US Dollars  SOL USD   Tether tokens  SOL USDt Yes b  Perhaps I am mistaken but don t end user transactions and queries via the Solana command line client go through a specific server   I know I ve sometimes gotten  gateway time outs  and the like which suggests to me that it s a specific hosted server   I assumed that when you select your  cluster  you are using a specific front end to the Solana network   Am I wrong   I could be wrong   Please educate me c  I am not talking about in the code  I m talking about in the stated design   See https   docs solana com proposals slashing I think the recent price rise was due to the people seeing that the expected crash due to the token unlock didn t actually happen  so all the  I like SOL but was worried about it crashing with the unlock  people bought in and caused it to rise  Just my theory from talking some other more experienced traders  not an expert Wut  It s not beta  Go build stuff with it  It s fast and flexible as shit Please post proof I just look on Coingecko  they have Market Cap and then Fully Diluted Valuation Where do you find the fully diluted market cap Good to hear from someone that has used AVAX  Felt to me like it came out of nowhere and then all the sudden there are shills for it everywhere So far I ve just used Serum via SolFlare s DEX  primarily to buy and sell SRM and FTT  The transactions were fast and cheap  Much mo betta than my experience with Uniswap last summer  It feels like Solana is doing a good job making deals to get other projects using their chain  Can t say I m planning to use any of them  but I guess Kin is moving to Solana and those MoFo s post on their sub like crazy so I guess their using it for something No lending on Serum that I m aware of Did you get these numbers from the block explorer

At this point that stake account is earning  4 000 SOL every three days   At  10 SOL that s  40 000 every three days   10 probably being close to the price that you have to sell at to move large quantities    Must be nice The above is from the Solana command line client   At this point  I personally would recommend that anyone using Solana know how to use the command line client   I think we re still to early to be too dependent on other front ends The command used to get the above results is     solana stake account xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxWhere xxxxx is the stake account MetaMask Legacy Web3 version google chrome extention just tested with a 2 usdt tx   same thing happened that it could not get transferred due to insufficient fees  i rejected it but this time the tx was actually cancelled But with the FTT tx  the process kept going into a loop  when i rejected it  it tried it like 7 times over  kept coming back Is there anyone from the Solana team that can give support on this issue   Why does Solana interact ECR20 TX with a complete other platform as Metamax   how is this even possible  And i see that my FTT have gone somewhere on the TX id  but where have they gone no  i even have the Solana wallet on my ledger so would be impossible Did you ever get an answer on this  I am using SolFlare  validating with Everstake and my balance remains unchanged as well even after an

validator In my experience my rewards were incorporated into my stake account at the end of every epoch   I could see the increased balance a couple of hours after the epoch ended  which is the soonest I ever checked Although my balance updated immediately  the table of  epoch rewards  that is displayed at the end didn t update immediately   I don t quite understand who generates that data   it doesn t seem like it would need to be stored anywhere as it could be computed  so I don t know why it wouldn t always either be displayed or not displayed   I m talking about this     Balance

agree Solana has so far not been a smooth experience  I also thought I lost funds on Raydium but 5 minutes later the screen showed the correct amount     I ve used many dapps on other blockchains and Solana definitely has too many error messages popping up compared to others  Solflare wallet also has issues  Binance Smart chain is a bit slower but fairly confident the transaction will go through  Cosmos seemed to take too long to confirm  Fantom also has some technical issues  Avalanche was the fastest and has a high rate of transaction success I had issues too with sending to Binance yesterday but it was that Binance was taking longer than usual to show incoming transactions   I sent a small amount initially to test if the funds would go through because I hadn t sent a Solana transaction before and didn t want to mess it up My initial deposit showed up after about 30 mins of waiting  so I then proceeded to sent my entire balance The first transaction did have me worried a little bit so I contacted support  I really should have waited a bit longer I hope your issue has now resolved itself Solana tanked because it s just the normal ebb and flow of market prices  nothing has changed fundamentally so there s no need to worry I focus on the longer term instead of daily ups and downs I wanted to send from exodus to my coinspot wallet and had to enter a manual send with the transaction history and the amount of coins sent  not sure if it s the same situation  but I thought I lost my coins untill I did some research  good luck and I hope it works out for you I have tried to bump the gas ETH fees by transferring 0 02 ETH to my Metamask wallet but still the TX was not processed   Can you please tell me where my FTT are now   Also i dont want to lose the remaining USDT and RAY i have on this same wallet Please help Thank you  I will give it a try By  ledger   I meant the solana chain  not the key device Cheers xMARK token has successfully bridged to Solana

Solana offers industry leading speed  security  and consensus on its blockchain I have what I call the  Madoff Rule   There is no way that anyone can be consistently offering APY returns higher than 10   what Bernie Madoff was offering  without the risk of loss APY that high means one of three things 1  The underlying currency is rapidly losing value 2  The APY is flexible and will drop to 3 5  when people jump in 3  It s a straight up ponzi scheme  and promised returns don t actually exist In this case  it s probably  2  but if the APY actually stays that high  then get ready to jump out before it collapses DCA into SOL on a 5 year plan    no selling No it s just there isn t a lot of information out there that s easy to find and kind of ELI5s the use of the wallet and any possible problems from a slight over sight like mine  I pretty much knew I fucked up I just didn t know exactly where and how the program would handle it  If you have trouble with Metamask there s at least a moderate amount of info on the internet  Metamask Support or YouTube videos to help  There is like nothing on how Solana actually works I use the trading view website  I am still fairly new to technical analysis but that s where I m learning Yoyo  Do you mind sharing what platform or website you use to view technicals on crypto  I m dabble in stocks but have recently decided to finally start researching crypto some more  and i d love to find a good platform to do some technical research with similar indicators you d see on a stock screening app or website You re gonna need to give more info than this lmao Are you sure you re not just unfamiliar with how epochs work  Each solana epoch is 3 days  IIRC   When you hit  stake  it won t activate until the next epoch starts  Once it s started staking  you can t remove it until that current epoch starts  Solanabeach io has the epoch information When you hit  send  on sollet io it gives an option to send in ERC20 to MetaMask  Same exact process as getting ERC20 in It s not diving  it rose extremely quick in a matter of days and now it s finally slowing down and following what the market has been doing Ledger Nano S Anyone here who already get some staking rewards after activating the SOL How the hell are they giving 43 7  yield This coin sounds like a nightmare Nano S with solflare com UI  No app on ledger live at the moment RSI and MACD levels looked like they were about to drop that s why I decided to sell some I use  solflare and currently my stake is in Moonlet  I m looking to setup my own validator but I want

2021-02-27,13.60157446,14.6120646,13.0572728,Nice  indeed  Makes you wary of the fact that many PoS networks  not necessarily this one in particular  could in fact be ponzi schemes  I highly doubt slashing balances this out as I feel it s more of a deterrent than something large validators would actually risk happening   I ve heard of something called 100  slashing but I m not sure if any chains are actually doing that at the moment    Makes you extra wary when these slashed tokens go to a  treasury   Even if this treasury is supposedly guarded by the network  it s very possible that there are multiple corrupt validators set up by the founders  feigning decentralisation but with sufficient collective voting power to do whatever they want Doesn t look like it allows staking right
2021-03-02,14.96684488,15.22412493,13.46074941,Raydium is defi on sol  check it out Use a different wallet until Trust fix it   really  I ve changed wallets as part of this issue Thanks for your response  What do you think should be done at the moment Trust wallet and solana are still buggy https   www reddit com r KinFoundation comments lv4jiw how_to_withdraw_kin_from_ftxcom_to_trust_wallet  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share Computers making adjustments to pricing estimates I don t see it on Coingecko    scam No dapps No problem  I m newer to reading charts and interpreting patterns  Yeah it seems like there hasn t been selling resistance yet the price doesn t seem to move much  Over longer term it has been but jw
2021-03-03,13.96353988,14.72935857,13.76704854,There is some info about the transaction fees I reference here  https   docs solana com implemented proposals ed_overview ed_overviewIt says a portion is burned and the rest to the leader  which of course is chosen by a semi random lottery where  you have more of a chance of being leader based on your staked amount  at least as I understand it  Now I m sure those fees are small  but I ve also seen that someone with a 3950x and a 3080 was averaging 250k TPS on the testnet  https   forums solana com t results individual time trial benchmark performance testing 789   so I think the question is how many times are you gonna be chosen leader  and how many transactions might you process  At least for someone who doesn t have anywhere near that amount of SOL and can t reasonably expect to ever attract that type of stake  at least initially Yea I ve got 400mb symmetrical speeds and can get a gig connection through fios if need be  The build was gonna be pretty beefy too as per the specs below  so I guess I ll see what happens  I ll let it go for an epoch or two to see where I m at 5950xRTX 3090  although I thought I saw that GPU s are disabled on the mainnet currently  and I m gonna initially test with a 3070 1TB 980 Pro4 TB 860 EVO64 GB RAM  if this is profitable  I ll do my own build with these specs but 128 GB RAM I think that if you have your own network that is capable of sustaining the 200 MBit sec that Solana a validator currently requires  which is what I was told in another thread is what it is using  and have some moderately powerful hardware lying around to try it out  then why not have a go   I personally do not know the exact earnings that I can expect  and the only way to know for sure is to run one for a while and see what happens I believe the issue with Serum at the moment is the limited liquidity pool and high slippage when swapping Same issue here     just seeing it  If anyone can post update or help troubleshoot tyvm Bitcoin was not super easy to buy early either I don t think   I bought mine on eBay but they stopped allowing sales there pretty soon after that   Bitcoin had the early advantage of being there before lots of financial restrictions came along Anyway can t you just use an exchange like Serum to trade other cryptocurrencies for SOL   Honest question as I haven t tried anything like that yet   I bought my SOL from a friend directly The biggest problem is solana is comprimising decentralisation It is decentralized I don t even see how to buy SOL like I could Bitcoin  It seems to be marketed only outside the US  And the vanishingly small transaction cost has been in their literature since day one  like they intend to leave it virtually free  If I buy something for  10 on my credit card  the merchant might pay a subsidiary of Bank of America 25 cents as a merchant fee  but if it were done through Solana the cost would be  0 0001 gt p p s  I should mention that I have a friend with a lot of SOL who is willing to stake with me which is the only reason that this has any chance of being profitable   Unless you think you can attract a large amount of SOL to your validator  I don t think it is feasable to make money this way Were you able to price out transaction fee s at all  Even as a percentage of what you d take in  I can t really think of any way I could attract a large amount of stake  and I can t take part in TdS to get foundation rewards either   Also  were you able to price out a break even point on the amount of stake needed at current price to be profitable I just doubled down aswell the revenue will come from the actual utility of the network  not from artificially created scarcity Sorry  just saw this message  I m using a Nano S Inflation I got in the project for the money but after a month I am falling in love with the project  I might double my position at this point Where is the revenue if the transaction rate times the fee per transaction equals 50 cents per second  if the project were working at full capacity  And this is split between all the transaction verifiers I dealt with the same issues with binance  Took a week or so before withdrawal was enabled again  I switched to ftx Binance chain is a centralized clone of ethereum that was able to instantly onboard everyone already using binance easily   That s a big difference than the process something decentralized takes I think it is more about fear They are scared because they saw how many people use Solana to transfer funds in out from Binance  It was really convinient  fast and cheap option to move money between exchanges and wallets  It was cheapest and fastest option even with their very high SOL transfer fee of 0 01 SOL That s good for Solana   there is market need for Solana characteristics and Binance can t provide them on their own because of their high transfer fees Binance Chain is a corporate chain with closed source like project characteristics I can t find any GitHub repo for their blockchain node Binance is scared as fuck because of Solana   they recently blocked Solana Withdraw option because people were using Solana to transfer funds fast  amp  cheaply between wallets other exchanges Yeah  just look at binance chain  takes forever  like 3 whole days to onboard all those peopleLN is bullshit  lagging on for years  systemic flaws  that s why nobody uses it   Eth L2 s are way better   As soon as uni scales it s on I m seeing something way different on the FTX US exchange  https   imgur com hwxeYv4  https   imgur com IpafIQy It s fast when it works but it barely works Fac I confirm that Trust wallet doesn t work properly at the moment
2021-03-04,14.09486709,14.26036093,12.77126993,Exactly why it is so terrible Might be an interesting comparison if the number if transactions that Bitcoin processes was not a billionth or less than those supported by the payment mechanisms you cite BTC energy use scales with block reward value  i e   market cap   not with the number of transactions As long as BTC doubles more quickly than every 4 years even after accounting for the halving of block rewards every 4 years the net reward in USD  and incentive for wasting electricity to get those rewards  goes up  Note that even if the current BTC network would be stopped  the actual BTC tokens could be migrated to a different platform  so a ban would not necessarily impact BTC pricing Ah got it gt  published 3 monSorry  my comment was confusing and not fully correct  Agree with above  534 on Mainnet and I pulled my number from TDS Perhaps for now  but thinking ahead   what we are using today will not be high hardware requirements  even in a year from now  thinking moore s law   I would also assume the validators continues to increase and therefore so does decentralization valid point 89 90  of bitcoin has been mined  While I see your point  this seems to be a short term phenomenon  does it not  Once all 21MM are mined   the machines stop  I m no expert but this was explained to me this way ️ It s probably closer to 1 1 000 000th of BTC s energy usage Would be interested to calculate how environmentally expensive is to load cash machines by cash globally  imagine like g4s oil expenses  paying admin people in office to plan these people shifts  paying directors bonuses  in comparison to mine btc globally  Scalling might be difficult bit but forget inefficient btc blockchain  I believe that even inefficient blockchain is green agaist inefficiency of global cash system  Or would you think i m completely wrong Is that per transaction or just overall Because per transaction it s probably 1 millionth or less the energy usage Thanks Can t speak for the O P  but I think it matters a lot Bitcoin will face resistance as it becomes more obvious that it s a very  very environmentally dirty cryptocurrency   Kind of like how oil companies fight an uphill battle for public image and why electric car companies get a marketing boost just from being the alternative to the dirty oil industry Bitcoin may eventually be deemed a threat to national security  in the USA  if it starts using so much energy as to endanger the stability of the power infrastructure or create price pressures that are deemed so overwhelmingly bad for the country as to affect national security Bitcoin may also be deemed such a problem by other countries or even be deemed a threat to security on a global scale  like global warming So from that perspective a cryptocurrency which uses much less power than bitcoin has a built in marketing advantage Bitcoin is in a death  to the planet  spiral of energy usage   as its price go up  people spend more energy mining it  and as more energy is used mining it  it becomes more expensive to produce and so the price goes up   This cannot go on forever  which puts some kind of ceiling on bitcoin that a cryptocurrency using reasonable  scalable levels of power does not face This is why it matters Also on a related note  cryptocurrencies that require vast amounts of silicon  i e  Ethereum  may also be deemed a national security threat if their usage leads to chip shortages affecting industrial production of goods   We are already there  I would not be surprised if the other shoe drops and Ethereum becomes illegal for national security reasons having to do with preventing damage to the economy from artificially created chip shortages Nothing is even close to Bitcoin in terms of electricity use  My uninformed guess would be that Solana uses less than 10  the amount of electricity used by Bitcoin I m just curious how different cryptos compare to each other specifically Solflare needs a lot of work IMO  They don t even have QR codes which is crypto wallet 101 these days It has 534 validators  with the top 7 validators owning 1 3 of the stake  You can check up to date metrics here   https   solanabeach io validators  https   solanabeach io validators Mainnet is launched  It was launched in March and is successfully working  For your understanding   Yes  we were first calling it beta because it was just launched and not every function was available  We will keep the suffix  beta  for a year or so because we want to check the mainnet stability in the long term and make sure we have a great product  But it s a working network   partners work on this network  Serum DEX running on this blockchain  KIN moves it s users to this network and that is exactly the blockchain the Solana Accelerator team winners use to build on I got confused by an article published 3 months ago where staking rewards aren t active  It seems decentralized now  Thanks for clarification Their nodes have really high hardware requirements so it might not meet some people s standards for decentralisation then why do defi coins shoot up in price at about the same speed as bnb did   all the same speculative mania  puts the blinders on so you can t see what fundamentls are being priced in so only a few are actually profitable Solana is  a decentralized blockchain  It had over 100 validators just as of Dec  2020 and now has over 1 100 Sushi coming to SOL would be huge Great news to see new development built using SOL Agreed  I got introduced after doing research given frustration with ETH fees  I had  400 USD in one token and it cost me  122 to Swap it   I saw an article on my brokerage trading platform about the Solana team and it prompted me to check it out  I started buying and staking months ago You can buy Sol on  Binance US  https   Binance US  or transfer funds to a wallet and buy on chain gt Why do you say this So I  having the same issue   I emailed the contact us with a screenshot  and I ll let you know what I find out You are staking all of your Solana  and you need to leave a little bit unstaked in your wallet to cover any incidental fees associated with claiming your rewards   I have  01 SOL in the regular wallet with no issues   My ZIL I have to leave 30 ZIL unstaked as a buffer or cushion I hopped on their Discord  One of their

concerns I suppose that s possible  The word on discord is it costs about 1 sol a day to run a validator  Didn t say whether the fees covered it or what  but I guess I ll find out Oof   sorry to hear that  And yes  fios is unmetered  or so they say anyway  I need to get through a single epoch though first lol  I guess I ll have an idea after that on whether it s something worth doing Interesting info  thank you   Also are you aware that every vote a validator does is a transaction and costs a transaction fee   I am not sure exactly how the math works out but there is probably some staked amount where you are leader enough that the transaction fees you take in offset the transaction fees you pay out when voting
2021-03-07,13.04392705,13.99690288,12.72638542,Are there any outgoing tx  Or is it literally just non existent Thank you Toly  I will look up those terms  Gotta love a community where the CEO is so accessible Understood Aren t they all released now It s all open source  and we don t use tps metrics as a proxy for adoption  It s only a measurement of capacity performance costs   This is why solana validators don t need 32 eth   64k     to be a block producer We don t count validator activity as transactions   They actually are transactions   Big difference   This is why there is no min stake on solana   You don t need 32 eth to be a block producer Roughly 50  of the tx load is consensus votes  Why votes  Well the whole point of what we are building is core censorship resistance  To increase the min set of nodes that participate in consensus you need more signatures  more bandwidth  more messages etc    Our vm is designed to horizontally scale  so more cores   gt  more tps   gt  more capacity   gt  more nodes voting   gt  more censorship resistance You can t compare tx counts on solana with ethereum  Nasdaq handles 500k messages per second for about 5k actual trades   Most of those messages are cancels  This is why 40  is the load is serum  bids  asks  cancels   This is how MMs deal with impermanent loss No one is trying to claim that tx counts are meaningful metric of adoption   But it s a great proof point that the network is cheap  and cheap at its core  which is censorship resistance

2021-03-09,13.61529099,14.98644427,13.32018701,Ahh this may be why it won t let me create a token  Will try this I asked the telegram admins  OXYPOOL tokens will be locked for 1 year  and you ll be able to convert them to OXY tokens at a rate of 1 OXYPOOL   8 888 OXY  However you can still sell your OXYPOOL share on Bonfida  no lockup for that  What s SECO The read more link works for me  Here it is https   raydium gitbook io raydium  and to answer your question  yes  It includes a reskin of serum but also a bunch more I believe that you must have some Solana on your Sollet to add a token  It takes a very small txn fee to process Thanks for the reply  I tried to add the token to my wallet but I bet an error message that s says  Transaction simulation failed  attempt to debit an account but no no record or prior credit   So I tried to use the mint address to send Ray to it snd exchange said it s not a valid address Did not find an answer so I would assume a 1 year lock up  OXY is being added to SECO so you could get some exposure that way Crypto is getting a lot of attention nowadays but even slick GUI can t hide huge problems with mainstream blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum The best example are user reviews of mainstream crypto apps  Google Play   BitPay   Review  https   play google com store apps details id com bitpay wallet amp reviewId gp 3AAOqpTOGFliA5mcileoZBb yQEBqiWe7kWjaKPCoKQJSzmrRlkSg0J3xqL6wnlPiTNDUpZWVWGngAPAI2wp7vPQ Solana solves that problems   we need more integration with wallets exchanges Hey did you find the answer to this question  Im thinking of OXY from OXY Pool too however Idk if my tokens will be tradeable after Oxygen lists on exchanges You will want to first add the token to your wallet  Once you have a balance of 0 RAY on your wallet  there should be a button for Deposit and Send  You will want to deposit your RAY to the address listed under Deposit The mint address is simply an identifier for the token I think the perfect and canonical example being Bitcoin Lightning  wherein every user has to sequester bitcoin  a costly process  to establish a relationship with everyone else they want to exchange bitcoin with  and has to watch the blockchain constantly  a costly process  to ensure that their counterparty doesn t dissolve the relationship and steal the funds   And supposedly you can then send bitcoin through a mesh network of parties that your direct relationships are connected to  etc  but that just means that your transactions are now subject to N more possibilities of channel withdrawal before actual settlement   Sounds like a nightmare to me and I expect the only reason it s in use at all is that alot of hopeful people really want it to work and keep participating even though it s fundamentally flawed I tried to read about it   Their  Read More  link on their site doesn t do anything   Is it anything more than a re skin of a Serum trading app That was also my surprise after coming back to crypto In short  it s kind of a stopgap to hide problems under a new layer It does not solve source of the problem it creates new ones Does anyone have a solid resource about what all these layers are  Coming back into crypto and hearing about L1  L2 etc Have you ever heard of Raydium Good news everyone  I bet china will love this Will see how ETH 2 0 goes in July lol https   www identity com embedding identity into the blockchain with solana Metamask on Binance   No Also on sollet don t need metamask And then L3 on top of that L2 And then L4 on top of that L3 And then L5 on top of that L4 It depends how well it will scale beyond 50k TPS  which is a lot compared to Ethereum 15 TPS  If someone thinks CPU GPU performance peaked and we will not see any substantial improvements in the future then Solana won t scale well But I m supporter of Moore s law and I don t think it s over   it changed a bit to multicore processing but overall price performance is progressing as it should AMD  ARM and recently Apple are pushing whole CPU GPU industry forward and Intel is dead not Moore s law Thanks for this but it asks me to connect Metamask  Do I need to transfer to Metamask and then transfer to Sollet Avalanche is written in Go Go is quite good language but it is using Garbage Collector for memory management  This will cause a lot of micro sleeps for Garbage Collection and will degrade system performance under high load It is proven that systems with Garbage Collection are performing poorly under very high load workloads High performance systems should be written in C C   or Rust like system programming languages  Rust is especially good for that because it also guarantees memory safety and has other security related advantages Even Google  Go creators  is now exploring Rust   they are founding member of Rust Foundation Makes it sound like he is farming and able to do everything he was doing on eth on Solana now    Something tells me this is not the case which makes his statement quite misleading Unless sharding works How about the costs when there will be way more users  Will they stay below 0 10 what about avax tho It s documented in  Serum Academy Convert erc 20 to spl tokens   First make Sollet wallet  Put some Sol in it  Then     token and choose wrapped eth  Then choose  receive   Then choose  native eth Don t know why there is Cardano post on Solana sub But I can share my thoughts on Cardano   Cardano s founder Charles Hoskinson is targeting Tesla investors here  https   youtu be CuKhyz280zA  https   youtu be CuKhyz280zA Cardano is a pure pump and dump   founder is doing interviews on investment channels  And his arrogance with PhD style speak is a red flag for me Cardano is PR and academia like project IMHO gt Tds delegation grants more than cover it The problem is  unless I m not understanding correctly  that TdS grants are only available to non us entities correct
2021-03-10,14.85092886,15.18793776,14.07906427,Here s a  source  https   boxmining com solana sol  Proof_of_History  that is better than my brain haha It s the same bft if you assume attackers can t arbitrarily speed up sequential sha256 Cheers So basically each transaction has a time stamp encrypted via SHA256 that shows when it took place  What s the contingency plan of transactions took place at an identical time  Also what shared consensus mechanism is in place to make sure said transactions are legitimate  Sorry to pick your brain just trying to wrap my head around it lol Here s a  video

Guys if you want to understand what Raydium is  just think of early Sushiswap or Uniswap  It provides liquidity for swaps  There are other functions  but for now as a user most people use the liquidity mining combined with farms for high APY Then you harvest the earnings and deposit into RAY staking to compound even higher APY Looking good so far  So sick of ETH gas fees  will be shifting after this is implemented You can t find it on Solflare  The only way to know about the transactions is by using the Solana command client line   https   www reddit com r solana comments lt10w7 when

his wallet for it to work Elaborate  please I had a similar issue the other day  Swaps still worked just fine though Some exchanges like Binance   com  not  us  and FTX have generous deposit withdrawal limits for individuals that aren t KYC d  so you could always try that  alternatively  though  you could also try a service like changelly  If you onramp though changelly the fees won t be the best if though  so I suggest buying USDT or USDC through coinbase first and then using that to trade  If you do it that way I think you ll only lose about 1 2    but don t quote me on that number https   snapshot page   sushi proposal QmYBCGv3dW6svrgHyCZTtsFy3fpG8LqET2PCzDDVLjWYq4 I d love for this to be true  however  I didn t see any mention at all of Solana in the article  or hear any mention in the video Serum makes it easy to create and use marketplaces  but raydium links all these different markets together creating a much larger  more robust liquidity pool Where did you find that Curv runs on Stellar  I don t think it runs on any blockchain specifically or exclusively but I could be wrong  You have to request the whitepaper through email so Meh adorable you think that usability is what matters  IF actually being able to use a chain is what was important then EOSIO based shit would dominate all the top market cap spots instead of just dominating all the top spots on bloctivity The worse something functions the higher the market cap  DEFI and NFTs are only a thing on eth because they can drive the fees super high which makes miners cash  Miners drive the whole

Serum already does everything that they said they do in Raydium  so I m trying to understand what the value add is Buy on blockfolio Paypal is not crypto  It doesn t know what crypto needs  It bought crypto and lets users have credit for crypto but Paypal is not going to offer more than their safe choices  They wont even add ADA Big if true  In interviews  Anatoly always comments about how Visa MasterCard should and would want to use Solana since it is the only decentralized blockchain that can handle the TPS they require  More specifically  he says that if Visa MC don t do it  then they are at risk of being disrupted by a more forward thinking company  Enter PayPal That was posted 5 days ago and says  full story coming later today Interesting   thanks for the update  I guess we could consider OXYPOOL as a sort of leveraged play SECO is the Serum ECOsystem token which is an index composed of SRM  RAY  FIDA  LQID  MAPS  SOL  and i think they just voted on adding OXY Just curious  but how are people running the system making any profit or even breaking even  Where are the fees being paid at

legitimacy to this chain being a decent alternative to Ethereum This is an important piece of the puzzle  Very bullish good answer  i had never thought of this  what language and frameworks does solana use It is widely used  You can use it with Ledger Nano for extra security Well  I know that s the most use Stable Coin    but that s a Coin with suspected fraud Thanks I will check this out  Is Solflare a well tested product You can stake SOL without Exchange   for example using  SolFlare com  https   SolFlare com  or command line solana client You can find more information here    https

and date  just when in sequence it happened relative to other transactions Would be general collision resolutions  This is kinda what normal blockchains have to do   since they don t have a time   it can be considered that all active transactions  waiting to be processed happened at the same time
2021-03-12,16.02091887,16.48579592,14.11122934,It s just sha256 in a loop  Current output is the next input  Quantum computing is 20 years away still  which basically means it s theoretical at this point and there is no point in worrying about it  There is quantum resistant cryptography in development   and it s easy to switch once there is some industry adoption No  if you can arbitrarily speed up sha256  go mine Bitcoin Moving assets cross chains  e g  users  is really not that big of a hurdle  as long as what the user is trying to accomplish is available  As an example  USDC just launched on SOL  and SOL is now the 2nd largest token network with 3 2  of the market  That was money moving from one chain to another  not new money  I think the user base is fluid  To me  moving chains is not like leaving Facebook to   insert social media site here    where if you move to another network   you potentially lose the value of the network   your connections   friends While applications would need to be reprogrammed  from a user perspective    if I  can earn 200  staking on SOL and 200  staking on ETH   what value does the application on ETH provide  And to address the real issue  if I earn 200  and then burn my gains to cover ETH gas fees  what real value is created   This is what I think that cyrpto defi heads like me are figuring out  especially with the launch of Raydium  I am no whale  so the fees matter   There is reported to be good amount of development for SOL right now  All the tools are almost in place  Wallets  stable coins  DEX  AMM  Etc  But  I do think one of the biggest pieces missing is a marketplace like AAVE   I do hope a discussion about an AAVE   SOL application could be taking place as AAVE supported the recent SOL hackathon     That last comment is pure FUD BTW    Solana x Serum DeFi Hackathon  https   solana com defi I am using  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  as one of my wallets  When I have a SPL token and I want to send it to an ETH wallet  there is an option to swap the wrapped SPL token for a fee   The option uses Metamask to perform this swap  I would think that if you have an ERC token  you could perform the same process when bringing into your wallet You can stake   it s pretty easy  https   docs solana com staking Hi dumb  I m dad doesn t matter  There are like 50 people that understand how Solana works  It s model lacks approachability to regular  non IT scientific people to build the network I realize I m dumb  but I watched 5 hours of tutorials and youtube materials on Solana and still have no clue how I can contribute aside of being a validator that requires 5000  worth  of hardware 1  Uniswap from any to SRM ERC20 using metamask2  Buy 20  worth of SOL from moonpay com and deposit into sollet io3  Add token account for SRM SPL in sollet io4  Go to receive on the SRM SPL wallet and select the ERC20 tab5  Connect metamask and send the SRM ERC20 to the given address  It will be converted to SRM SPL6  Enjoy fast swaps and transfers on solana For SOL SPM tokens you have to use a solana based defi  there is dex projectserum com for classic exchange and swap projectserum com for uniswap style swapping  You can connect to those sites using your sollet io wallet  Fees are about 0 3  and swaps take 2 3 seconds You can swap on sollet io between ETH ERC20 and SOL SPL version of any token  fee is between an ETH token transfer and a Uniswap  Note  You need SOL before you can convert from ETH to SOL and need to open a token account  Token accounts have separate addresses on Solana  its not like on ETH where tokens are stored together with the ETH  If you want to buy a tiny amount of SOL you can use moonpay com and just pay with apple pay to get 20  worth of SOL without passport thanks for the input  i m lost with both these things    the help documentation on BONFIDA is non existent            Pools    amp  x200B       How do pools rebalance    https   help bonfida com pools rebalance   Updated on 20 Dec 2020  amp  x200B Right  It s to make it tradable on different blockchains  You can convert a SRM ERC 20 token to an SOL SRM token and back using Metamask and any Solana based dex  like dex projectserum  If you plan on just trading coins within the Solana blockchain and want to avoid gas fees  high b c of using ETH   then try to buy the token natively within the Solana blockchain if you can  using an app like Blockfolio for instance  Side note  That s the same reason some coins are  wrapped   if you ve seen like wrapped BTC for instance  it makes it tradable within a different blockchain  Does that make sense So I did some digging   The difference between Fida and Ray is  Fida pools are more like investment pools  Ray pool are liquidity pools  Fida is more like a frontend  its a wallet and a trading interface that runs on Serum and Solana wallet    amp  x200B That was the best I could find  lmk I think you can send SRM from a sollet wallet on either chain  you just choose by picking a tab when you transfer Bump  Someone has the answer and I d also like to know Bump  Couldn t agree more  They are both liquidity providers for the Serum DEX and both are GUIs for the Serum DEX  Yet  I don t see why there needs to be a new interface on top of the already solid Serum DEX interface Eth userbase is fluid  Installing another extension wallet  hooking up ledger to phantom sollet  etc    are not big hurdles for the existing crypto user base who already have some understanding of pki Commenting to follow this post  Also curious how to swap erc 20 tokens such as USDC onto the SPL network Because to move to Solana  you would have to completely start over and rebuild your app  To move to L2  you just deploy the solidity code that you already have  Also  Ethereum already has all the users  If you move your app to Solana  you re potential user base is cut by 1000x i m uneasy about centralized KYC providers like civic  seems ripe for abuse and antithetical to the goals and aim of crypto in general Solana captured 3 2  of the UDSC issuance in about 3 4 months  Lighting fast adoption and it will be interesting to watch how the assets on chain grow  When I look at market caps and see stats like this  it leads me to believe that SOL is undervalued Why wait for a L2 solution when there is a L1 that already works Yeah  so nothing to do with the website deposit to ftx then withdraw to solana wallet like sollet io I really like the idea of a wallet tied to an identity and I hope this can help less technically savvy people have access to crypto  Pumped to make a wallet and to try it out once released The person who posted that is an idiot  Read the comments Anybody know where to convert USDT from other chains to Solana Spam and referral fishing
2021-03-13,14.56380277,15.39439844,13.92005572,When you say it like that Sol is good actually SOL is pretty good in this respect ATOM  21 DAYS to unstake  LUNA  21 DAYS to unstake  GRT  28 DAYS to unstake  DOT  28 DAYS to unstake  can you imagine a cryptoCURRENCY that you have to decide to unstake almost a month before you can spend it Very very conservative predictions    crypto market has never been as widely accepted as it is today and there is a whole another level of investors in the market now compared to 2017 You haven t been keeping up with BSC lately I think it is quite common in staking  as a concept  that there is activation and cooldown period I m referring to sources   first article is from September 2020 and it clearly said  Stablecoin issuer Tether   has launched   its USDT coin on Solana blockchain  I don t see any difference from early February when I was last checking USDT Mint address and today Current supply as stated right now  updated daily  on Tether transparency page   Liabilities  USD  in Circulation on Solana     Total Authorized    1 54    Less  Authorized but not issued      1 54  So total authorized USDT is  1 54   can anyone tell me why this number is so low  USDC  current supply is 320 million One epoch   2 5 days How does that statement make sense  Ethereum s proof of work turns hardware improvements into a prisoners dilemma The debate on this for BTC has been absolutely ridiculous  claiming every raspberry pi on the planet needs to be able to run a full node   It s an excuse to surpress scaling On eth  the devs really do want to scale  and several methods are coming out   They maxed out the gas limit a few years ago  but it seems that requiring higher end hardware should be a no brainer  considering that POW is already centralized down to people who are willing to source  amp  deploy GPU s rather than sleep  amp  eat   They have large warehouse space devoted to it   So a highend gaming rig is  nothing  for a miner   To me  this seems the only rational choice  to up the requirements Solana s actually done that  so now we ll see if they can get a network effect through that eth bridge  and pull a binance No you send the ERC20 to MetaMask  and then go to sollet io and it ll have an option to convert your MetaMask ERC20 into SPL You could argue decentralization to be a different animal in a PoS chain than in PoW  Scalability and security are the ones it solves  decentralization is an ongoing governance effort that won t go away Right  and the FUD that comes with that is centralization due to the large hardware requirements and ever growing size of the chain  over 8TB already Ok  I had the notion of mining in my head  I was under the impression I could acquire the coins via hashing power I have at my disposal rather than using fiat  but I don t understand how mining in the concept of Solana works Get them from Binance or another exchange Get your facts right  Back in Sept 2020  Tether had merely announced it would launch their stable coin on Solana  now they have done it Yeah just figured next epoch will be in more than a day Not cool bro Tried that once  Took about a day Here s a good article on the subject    https   medium com solana labs turbine solanas block propagation protocol solves the scalability trilemma 2ddba46a51db  https   medium com solana labs turbine solanas block propagation protocol solves the scalability trilemma 2ddba46a51db Here s my interpretation  Ethereum considers high end hardware a risk to decentralization  Solana considers the hardware accessible enough to not pose a threat to decentralization  Therefore the trilemma is solved as you can scale with accessible high end hardware  having a secure chain with PoH and have enough nodes for it be decentralized  The trilemma invites for a subjective interpretation of what is sufficient decentralization and secure enough They are allergic to hardware  Why is evm single threaded Buy them If it was a hardware problem ethereum would have already solved With hardware  Latest nvidia GPU has 10 000 cores   So imagine each validator doing 10 000 more work then a single threaded evm environment Thanks but this is exactly what I don t get  Quote   In order to stake tokens on Solana  you first will need to transfer some SOL into a wallet that supports staking   For me it sounds like   in order to make the butter   first you need some butter  Where do I get the SOL to transfer to the wallet in the first place You re not Dad  You re bot  And you are Bad Isn t bsc being used by more users  now than eth  I don t use the ethereum blockchain  for anything not available on Sol I fall back to bsc Eth 2 0 was announced 6 months after the release of the Ethereum mainnet  it was announced at the end of 2015  It s been way harder to build than was anticipated I think  and it s why I take estimates of sharded networks launch dates with a grain of salt If ETH 2 0 was released now things would be a lot bleaker for Solana Unfortunately some GUIs are buggy I had problem with settling funds using popular GUI and fixed problem by just going to original Project Serum one  https   dex projectserum com   https   dex projectserum com To be honest I m surprised that ETH 2 0 is not here  I was hearing ETH 2 0 is coming in 2018  3 years is a lot of time in crypto world Of course it will be instant success because in one minute all of current ETH will become ETH 2 0 shard so 100  adoption  yay Unfortunately sharding is not a best idea   it mimics current financial system where transferring funds between SEPA and SWIFT systems is cumbersome and costly Eth 2 0 is coming along  these cosmos chains are okay that s an interesting way of framing it I don t hear much that is specific to Solana  However just like a bunch of other in development blockchains the big risk is that it can t be done in a reasonable amount of time  Eth 2 0 is coming along  these cosmos chains are okay  If Solana takes 5 years to work properly it will be extremely difficult to migrate users over   Even then you are on the assumption that crypto is hugely held back by Ethereum costs and transaction limits  However BSC  despite being centralized  hasn t seen enormous growth and it has way more TPS and way less fees than Eth  It might just be that there isn t demand for dapps blockchains It s not ethereum or bitcoin and it s not  1 000 per coin  Lots of blockchains claim they are  the third generation blockchain  but honestly solana is the only one that is a real evolution and doesn t involve sharding yes it does thank you You connect metamask to sollet io refer to this guide serum academy com en serum dex sol wallet So I could send an erc 20 tether for example to my sollet io and it would automatically wrap into an Spl tether  That s going to solve my problem if so Good news  USDt is natively supported on solana blockchain Yes  Sollet io has a function that bridges erc20 tokens to spl tokens Some states in the U S are prohibited from using practically any centralized exchanges  Is there any other way to convert  to spl tokens or even buy solana with the erc 20 tokens Is there a way to convert erc 20 tether for spl tether through a serum dex Protip  I use FTX   gt  BTC   gt  Fiat exchange of choice to avoid Ethereum altogether  You can deposit or withdraw any token as ERC 20 or SPL on FTX Good  fair question   I was moving tokens back to an exchange so I could use the exchange as an offramp to fiat  so I needed to go back to ERC As a former Ethereum trader moved onto Solana   I have to ask why you d ever be transferring tokens back to Ethereum You have to complete a Tour de SOL run which you have to apply to do  and which they are not offering again until later this month   You can read about the hoops involved here  https   docs solana com tour de sol And what other crypto projects do you contribute to How do you get the foundation to help seed Thank you creative  haha That s what it seems It looks like all you need to be a validator is  100 mo at a cheap data center  and the Solana Foundation will seed you with enough tokens to make a nice return at current SOL prices I would hope that the foundation starts pulling those stakes when higher quality validators come along   The goal should be to increase validator capability and quality  not reward anyone who can sign up for a cheap cloud hosting service and run a few command line programs
2021-03-14,15.30158118,15.34983211,14.37876449,Thank you I m in NY  Exchange for Solana in Exodus Wallet     or it may be on Bitrue  but not positive  XRP  XLM  DGB  VET and ATOM can all be exchanged into Solana in Exodus Wallet  Good luck and invest wisely  Just my opinion  not financial advice Thank you Thank you It went 10x on top of an ATH   It s a centralized shitcoin  but was able to absorb some defi traffic but yeah  the topic is solana Sorry  what s you point actually  sorry if missed the message here or being out of context   I can only say  I experimented a lot in the past days with BSC defi  While most of them are very  very close to scam projects  copy paste github codes  the speed and the low fees are really amazing  if you just look at that  Besides  since its controlled by bn it will be for sure supported to be that way  speed fees  for some time  Question is  will other serious use cases move from eth to bsc to give it a real reason to exist I don t like to call my post  FUD   rather some observations based on my short experience with the project itself     So  I am neither an expert in block tech  nor a programmer in general  I am a trader  And as a trader  since 2017 in crypto  I need to say  handling all the dex es while using  sollet io  https   sollet io  for the wallet it sukz  I had a really headache to solve that one issue here   https   www reddit com r solana comments m3rigz open _orders _account _is _undefined _any _solutions   https   www reddit com r solana comments m3rigz open_orders_account_is_undefined_any_solutions  and so I decided to leave it that project for now at least as being an active user of it  My idea was actually to change sol  that I did buy on an exchange  to usdt  buy with the half ray to put it into the ray usdt lp and gather experience while betting on a positive outcome for ray in the middle run  But the problems described above paired with other minor bucks like an endless need of unlocking  even I say  keep unlock   the wallet whenever I switch the  use cases  within the platform  which I can understand at least  but also whenever I reload my page since some fields are not being updated just to recognize that the page is saying again  please unlock the wallet    So I decided today to revert that transaction  means  buy sol  move it out from sollet wallet to an exchange and keep it there for future price speculation  But even that was a pain in the azz because the page wont let me settle the traded amount  from usdt to sol   I tried again few things out  but the   showed always  failed   In the end  I deleted the mnemonic  imported new the wallet  connected the wallet and said   settle automatically   After that my amount was settled automatically and so I could move out my sol to my exch wallet  I know its all in the beginning  I know there a lot of bugs and so on  Yet still  whatever the chain promise in sense of tps or speed or fees  for me  as a trader it doesn t matter if I need to read first the code docs to understand why something went wrong  Besides  there are a like hundreds other chains trying to  sell  the same story  low fees   fast speed  too TL DR speed fast   fees low but user experience terrible    p  s  btw I don t use eth chain for a very long time already bc of the fees I am having this issue  did you work it out I am confused Could I still use wrapped USDT address in my wallet I use sollet io  to receive USDT or I have to creat a new address by manual input this new USDT token mint address Es9vM No  FTX is fully custodial so you don t see the details about your staking address etc if you transfer your SOL there  Basically you trust them that you are able to withdraw your deposit again in the future     Doing the SOL staking on your own is more secure  and rewards are also around 10 If they are just testing with 1 5 USDT then why so much buzz about launching I am comfortable on the command line and would rather keep in wallet but that does sound good    works for  https   ftx us  https   ftx us   too  Thanks BTW if you dont feel comfortable with the command line  consider custodial staking at ftx com   over there they also generate 10  per year and they have very good reporting that can be used for tax reporting  Advantage of ftx is that you can also stake SRM which is not yet available as decentralized staking DM me if you want a referral link  5  off trading fees solana is still beta  so  the mobile apps such as moonlet have similar problem that it only shows the total but does not have reporting functionality Thanks u etan1 will give this a go  I m really surprised this doesn t exist on the UI  I don t see solflare on github maybe it s not open source  I m happy to file a feature request https   docs solana com cli install solana cli toolsyou can install the command line tools  then use  solana stake account YOUR_STAKE_ADDRESS  to get a tabular listing of all individual epoch rewards  it doesnt show the date though but epoch happens every 3 days so should be easy to add that missing info The first article from Block is not reported correctly  At that time  it was only announced  not issued  As for the 1 5 USDT supply on Solana  I guess Tether is probably still testing out the contract and mint more further
2021-03-15,14.47712718,14.79047269,13.69805655,how about  Cosmos chains  Binance  Terra  Secret  are among the most performant live deployments  Eth 2 0 is an ambitious vision for the future I am using nano X with Sunflare Moonlet io  https   Moonlet io  works very well Have both  one Backup  s  and one where i can manage  x   gt  ledger live   and both of them works great  Sure i can say i had some trouble with some Browsers  Opera doesnt work properly so i must use it with Edge all the time In solflare i must create a staking Account  So i dont know is this staking Wallet on the ledger or created by solflare I think ledger nano S is but not X Why isnt solflare supported  Using it for 3 month I just got it  how are you liking it I m using Moonlet   https   twitter com moonlet _wallet status 1360845299355439104  https   twitter com moonlet_wallet status 1360845299355439104 Binance There s only about 10k active defi users  it will have to get easier to use   There are a lot of defi dashboards  but people don t even know they exist or how to get into defi as a whole   Once the robinhood crowd gets on board  by making it as easy as robinhood  then the real game begins   Initial scaling would cause a quick pump  like BSC So  question for you then  Do you believe that your current TdS rewards of  500 of SOL is enough for someone to run a profitable validator  I ask because me and a friend are currently working on setting one up and were just gonna run it to find out  However  from all the information I d been able to gather  it seems like it would be difficult to be profitable without a large amount of SOL to stake right off the bat  I think the question comes down to how much one could make off fees  but given the nature of how leaders are chosen  that seems about impossible to forecast yep     this is has been a challenge for US based layer 1s I ll start mining your butthole  don t scam your stupid sites here You got the point didn t you 1  Bonfida is one of the many GUIs for Serum DEX  They are also providing own APIs with candle market data    https   docs bonfida com   https   docs bonfida com     for Serum DEX which are used in Serum DEX GUI source code    https   github com project serum serum dex ui  https   github com project serum serum dex ui    for some features You can use original Serum DEX GUI which is built from Serum DEX GUI repo here    https   dex projectserum com   https   dex projectserum com  Or you can use Bonfida GUI if you want more features from them I host own GUIs for DEX  Swap and Wallet   it s free using for example Cloudflare Pages  Just fork repo and create free Cloudflare account and then create Cloudflare Pages project Defi compare could have stored this data  but will try to pull from API retrospectively Please vote for us in the hackathon and we will store TVL and 24 hr vol for all Solana defi applications The is the math wallet but only on chrome if I recall correctly I m all over BSC  however the valuation of these projects assumes they will get incredible amounts of traffic  I ve actually found the growth rates of BSC underwhelming   I was hoping that the huge fees and transaction time was stopping defi from widespread adoption  However there are like 30 40k new addresses a day on BSC  and many of them won t be new users  It needs to grow at a faster pace than that to realize these valuations in my opinion  Pancake swap has averaged  7k addresses a day  and that s been steady for a month How should I have framed it Solana is proof of stake  So mining rewards get distributed depending on how much SOL is staked towards each node  The more SOL you stake the larger   of the mining rewards you will get Bad english   comments ignored  Sorry DONT CLICK ON THE LINKS  gt  HIGHLY SUSPICIOUSTHIS ACCOUNT IS SPAMMING REDD IT  is not REDDIT I would like to see a chart illustrating this growth  I feel like it was just last week when I saw numbers showing    100mm in pooled liquidity and    4mm in trade vol Why Eth 2 and all the sharded systems out there just have wildly different security and performance characteristics Of course  If you ever need help or want to swap crypto knowledge  give me a shout man  I m still learning everyday myself Solible is operated by Bonfida you want to mint a nft on a dex Check out Solible  I have tried to mint an NFT by emailing Bonfida  per instructions  but its taken a while
2021-03-16,14.16391157,14.28289603,13.229815,I am excited too for people to fill out mock brackets like the NCAA does in office pools et c and bet on those Why thank you sir  I ll look into that  Last year and this year I was trying to grow it to get people to love it as much as I do Implement this like DraftKings does with sports betting  you have a lucrative platform It s not a bad idea  if the pitch was for everyone to pump the winning coin to there s 560 validators on mainnet  The actual concern with decentralization is making sure delegators stake more evenly among validators so that it takes more validators to comprise 33  of the total stake FTX us I discredited the entire point actually   due to the low credibility of the flawed writing  and the insecure body language cues of the video presenter my X works with solflare Exodus    IBeen using it for almost two years  They support most coins  quick exchanges and good customer service
2021-03-17,13.634964,14.26679703,13.13052874,Is that number accurate  Only 10k defi users  Where do you find that metric Ok  I just thought we should talk about Cardano if we re talking about Ethereum killers in 2021  Cardano is the coin with the 4th largest market cap Solana is still impressive  of course  I m happy to see the progress it s made AI mentions Cardano in a previous article LINK  https   research sideshift ai ethereum killers of 2017 UPDATE PENDING No cardano Thanks  Appreciate hearing from you  Keeping making the magic  Hopefully the value follows I ll look eventually  Bonfida currently is not good with communicating all relevant information IMO I use ledger x with solflare
2021-03-27,14.78624602,16.80416436,14.75804617,Yeah  I would assume they are more focused on building right now  Once The infrastructure has been developed to a point they are satisfied with  they will probably open the floodgates with marketing any validator with low skip rate and low fee is what you need  Ideally  anyone from top 10 should do It would be nice if it automatically created contracts for each token as soon as you setup a trade  etc for some reason  Solana has focused more on Dev side of things and less on community building  Less than 6k people here for a project with  4B cap and many exciting things  The discord is always flowing with high IQ people there if it will be like on eth or bsc and metamask then it will be perfect Kin is what first got me interested in Solana  I ve been holding since Kin1  Kin4 is a whole new ballgame Then they should consider changing their messaging to  Pools coming soon  or something if they re going to promote the website at this stage  as like I said it appears broken all of us at KIN love Solana I will say that I did have to dig around a bit to figure out how to properly setup on Raydium  I would like to see some improvements to make the process more straightforward and user friendly in that regard i like Solana but needs better user experience with defi and for other token and after Solana hit into top 10 then community will grow Once we pass the event horizon  there s no going back The wormhole is also being developed  This will give you the opportunity to transfer tokens from ETH to SOL I m curious how this will evolve in the near future Check up time    of validators  are they going up  Do they have a website and socials  are they involved in staking other networks All these attributes can help you make your decision It sure is sexy  As is the name They are obviously still under development Nothing released yet  they are still under development  If they have anything like that  they ll announce it in their official Social Media Accounts I love the logo  That drives my investment decision OK  so what s your prediction for how when this gets priced in  It s been a few months since that unlock  and the price is up over 1000  since then Edit  Jan  8 is almost the exact day the price started mooning Yeah Sol has to be some of the best user experience in defi right now  can t believe it s not more widely adopted yet  It s a great project I ll be around for awhile to see how it goes Thanks   love people in the cryptoworld who are here for the technology Solana is a beast The Solana ecosystem is getting wild compared to it s 1 year old  The next coming months  years will be more than great for    SOL  diers out there  Glad to see Solana taking decentralization to a whole new level More information about that can be found in here   https   medium com solana labs chainlink and solana integration high quality price oracle data cd9fa41f6ecb  https   medium com solana labs chainlink and solana integration high quality price oracle data cd9fa41f6ecb Can you give me a link or something that proves these   basic facts    Where did you get that info of   80  is an Insider Owned    This is just plain irrelevant but you keep saying it as a shiny fact  Sorry mate  but you re totally wrong about this My advice is to split your stakes among 2 or more validators  just to make sure if X or Y Validator is offline  for any reason  or become malicious or     you ll still have your best Staking ROI guaranteed  This is good for your Stake  amp  the whole network itself  so it s a Win Win situation I just showed you proof that 4x the circulating supply was unlocked on Jan 7th 2021 and you are referencing April may 2020 data  If you didn t do this basic amount of DD before your investment    don t know what to say No assumption  just basic facts as stated by Solana themselves Chain link is on solana now right Do the math  I really like the tech  but this massive unlock has not been priced in  Which is smart for the insiders  but bad for anyone spending money on this right now It just moved into my top 3 favorite projects  And one of my other top 3  Kin  runs on Solana  I am honored to have gotten in at this level Giddyup Sure is nice they provide a transparency report  That s pretty unique  I m still not seeing the issue That s totally inaccurate my friend  what makes you assume such things Solana is literally 1 year old blockchain in this huge  amp  amazing cryptosphere  Solana grew amazingly in such a short period of time though  amp  it will take time to grow even more next coming months  amp  years  Fasten your belts  amp  enjoy the ride with the SOLfam I just dug up  this info  https   research binance com en projects solana  on some of the tokenomics  Here s a breakdown of token distribution Seed Sale 16 23 Founding Sale 12 92 Validator Sale 5 18 Strategic Sale 1 88 Coinlist Auction Sale 1 64 Team 12 79 Foundation 10 46 Community 38 89  amp  x200B So  with that being said  what s your argument again  Insiders  Hmmm  Not quite seeing it  myself  But maybe you can elaborate Welcome to the SOLfam buddy  enjoy the blazing fast  amp  frictionless  transactions  Solana ecosystem is just getting warmed up https   solana com transparency report 2020 12 pdf Once people catch on  it g gonna get crazy Got any links to back that claim Just wait until you realize that 80  of all tokens are owned by insiders and a whole new anxiety will start Love solana too  proof of history is amazing but the community is very small for now Interested to hear more from Solstarter Everstake  for instance  is charging 0  fee  They seem like a large operation  Is that a safe way to maximize rewards Some validators received grants and are offering low fees due to this to build up their stake  Malea is a good example  A great resource for validator performance is validators app  You want to disburse your sol amongst multiple validators for risk management purposes  I e  if one validator has significant downtime or becomes  malicious  once slashing is implemented  you don t want all your eggs in that single basket Staking reward is given by inflation rate  There is cost associated with being validator so if current is e g 13  and if somebody gives you max its morelikely one person having machine somewhere   To run sustainable business as validator you must take commision  So I wouldnt expect anything stable from validator who offers max reward  Am I right that any validator can change commision himself during after epoch
2021-03-28,16.47942327,19.38600611,16.34500899,I love you At 0 00028651BTC or 13 12 USD As speculative as anything else  ADA can a million dollar too some day that s good i should try that gt best user experience in defiI m sorry  have you even used any of the projects Well I hope you make a nice profit Cryptocurrencies aren t necessarily currencies  They represent value within their dApp or Blockchain  Although the word currency is  cryptocurrency  they fluctuate too much to be a common currency  let alone a world currency  However  there are these wonderful things called stablecoins that are not subject to the same volatility  USDC is one of the most popular  Let s say you have a wallet of cryptocurrencies  SOL  BTC  etc   and this wallet is connected to a credit debit card through smart contracts  When you use your card at the store  the smart contract seamlessly converts from your cryptocurrency to USDC and sends to the recipient  grocery store   Refunds could easily be processed through USDC  USDC has a native SPL token built on the Solana blockchain Lol Wait till sol goes to 1k then come back to comment fomo Absolutely But also any coin I buy I hold for 90 days before selling FOMO FOMO rick voice    heeyy check this out  https   solana com ecosystem I learned everything from the Discord server  People on there are very helpful not long before you brother Gives me hope for a few of my coins that have an actual working proof of concept like SWFT Did a YOLO on 1mm coins I think that around 3 usd 2 months ago or less time ago  I wanted to buy more when price dropped  It never dropped to reach my price by a few cents    Arggffg Would be greatly appreciated if you shared  valuable articles here Got 35 coins Bought at 18 96 People in S  Korea are already paying for goods  amp  services with cryptocurrency using the Chai dApp Many people in corrupt S  American countries use Monero Bitcoin itself was first used to by goods  amp  services on Silk Road  Cryptocurrency has been used as money for over 10 years I bought 100 coins at  18 25 todayWhat did you get in at cardano will likely never have any meaningful developer adoption I know I considered this and obviously made the right decision    amp  x200B I like the coin Considering the price is up 1000  since the token unlock on Jan  7  I would say the tokenomics aren t affecting it too negatively at this point anyone know when Sushi swap will by on Solana wonder if coinbase will list it anytime soon This isn t a meme stock but glad you re here nobody   puts Solana in the corner I am on both     but not much activity     I just want to contact the team to get into private if I can As of right now there is only Twitter and telegram  telegram  https   t me solstarter  Twitter  https   twitter com solstarterorg s 21 Possibly  I think it will just take time to build a healthy broad userbase that believes in the chain team Yes also holding positions in Eth Ada  Long term bull on both  SOL is just so cheap for the long term possibilities here  Thinking maybe price is held back by lack of exchanges trading it Yeah i ve been testing out the defi on Raydium and it s quite cool  It s my first experience with defi and I m now a believer Do they have discord I think at least 20b is reasonable for where the project is  I see no reason why it lags so far behind ADA with the actual on chain tech  however  Hoskinson is doing one hell of a job with their community  whether you like the guy or not   To be clear I do like ada dot in terms of long term projects No reason we don t see at least a market cap match of the likes of cardano  Exciting times A meme here or there wouldn t hurt this community How much   of the coins is released in circulation Sir  no aping on solana  Just good decisions I just aped into this coin yesterday Their commission is 9  now   Guess they figured they waited long enough to accumulate stake at 0  commission   I m very interested to see if their stake decreases now that they ve raised commission Check out how Solana works and you will realize why it s a good investment  Don t follow the trend people telling you what to buy  Instead find different cryptos that has a stable foundation with a bright future gt  6UszbwwcK4jBVmJBtaDKbA1EP6XuMgxWKV5x322PsRVRAs promised  I sent 0 1 SOL to this address   Hope it helps you with anything you re trying to do People are discovering Solana as a true replacement for Ethereum  Slowly but surely  It s not a coin with promises for a bright future  it s a coin with solid utility NOW All these shitcoin a going around   but Solana has actual value to me  I actually use it to do things We effectively wiped out a month long consolidation from previous ATH in 3 daily candles  Saying I m bullish is an understatement  I expect April to have explosive growth for the Solana ecosystem Yeah seems closer in valuation to a top 15 at least   My reasoning is it s faster than stellar and has a more defined ecosystem   There is a lot of symbiosis going on in Solana ecosystem as well Anyone heard of forbole  They offer 0  fee and seem like the way to go You re asking a biased crowd but we would say overwhelmingly yes  solana is incredibly undervalued Well said  yeah hopefully we can get a larger broad er userbase to use Sol  I used it once and I was hooked  Working defi with low transaction fees and lighting fast speeds  It s crazy to me that more aren t involved  coming soon I m sure Hard to say  but either way we are a tiny community  Given how much stuff is built on top of solana already  and some other coins with higher market caps  I think it s fair to say that 4billion isn t where it should be  None the less no one knows  I m just happy to be along for the ride I stake on solflare  Moonlet and ftx  non US version  offer staking as well  It s all same APY so really up to which ever you prefer Where are you staking your Solana coins  I am interested in staking my coins as well  Thanks So far  RAY  SRM  OXY  MAPS  MATH  ALEPH What solana projects have you looking into so far Have you tried the  migrate  tab  It should provide a simple walkthrough on how to migrate your LPs  Also  if you aren t in the Telegram I would recommend joining  Usually information drops there 1st before Twitter or anything else  You can also contact admins and other helpful people to assist with all types of problems  https   t me raydium Ohh i think that s what happened  The problem now is though that I can t even see or remove my liquidity from the wrapped usdt pool Do you know if you provided liquidity with wrapped tether or the SPL native tether It s Blade Validator  vote account BLADE1qNA1uNjRgER6DtUFf7FU3c1TWLLdpPeEcKatZ2I am not trying to sell my services here  really I am not   You can probably find validators in tier 2  that I am in  that have lower commission than I do and would be better choices if you are looking for max returns   Here are a few for you to consider stake fish  7VGU4ZwR1e1AFekqbqv2gvjeg47e1PwMPm4BfLt6rxNk I staked with them for a couple of epochs  their returns were quite good Moonlet io  GMpKrAwQ9oa4sJqEYQezLr8Z2TUAU72tXD4iMyfoJjbh 0

on steriods Buckle up  kiddos  Solana is running on a fusion reactor Same feel man  I used to respect him but not now haha  I respect the projects more than face nowPlacing my bet on the future with Solana too for this niche It was a good investment at one point  but man  Justin Sun represents such a high level of douche iness  I could never touch it because of that  I almost forgot about him  It s nice not seeing his annoying face all over crypto anymore  lol Lol thanks mateBut still TRX did  But SOL TRX   gt  SOL   Smart Spot on mate cheersAt least my small investment in SOL is already X3 or so Not that much to brag but I had them due to the need for token creation Ditch all my TRX for SOL For sure  I was being a little cheeky  I would prefer to see only the choicest projects on Solana  Thus far  it seems that s all that s available  Curious to see how this unfolds  Cheers Yes mate  I do have tokens created in this platform but looking for more of a future tokenomics potential not those BSC pump burn dump crapsToken created in SOL that is to stay will be super awesome Once we ve got a fleet of shitcoins to choose from on this platform  we will know that it s made the big time Looking forward for more features for token creation so we can have good tokenomicsBSC shit tokens are on the wild now Thank you  What s the address of your Validator Thank you  Extremely informative Solana was down a couple weeks ago   Any reasons the site was overwhelmed By the way my validator is basically entirely self staked    I staked my initial investment in SOL on it  and a friend with a lot of SOL staked the rest   So I don t really expect people to stake on my validator except out of a desire to spread stake around  although I am doing my best to provide quality service  hence my pride in my validator s very good voting record    However  this last epoch someone staked 20 SOL to my validator   my first stake from an unknown party   Whoever you are   thank you   I will do my best to make it worth your while If you re talking about top 10 from validators app  then I agree   But top 10 on solanabeach io is bad because then you re just concentrating stake in the largest validators I think that solanabeach io is doing a great disservice to Solana by showing the validator list by stake amount   It just contributes to people concentrating stake on the largest   The validator that runs solanabeach io is one of the largest so I think there is some bad for the network bias in how they are doing it   Oh well I agree   The best possible return is very likely to come from a large validator currently offering 0  commission  like Everstake I also agree that no commission validation is not sustainable   These validators are foregoing immediate profits to try to build a user base   I don t quite get what they expect to happen when they start turning on their commission though  given that they ve attracted all of the users looking for max return who presumably will then just go elsewhere  I run a validator and I have 8  commission which I think is pretty close to the average Within a given commission range  you can also look at the total number of votes being cast  since the vast majority of rewards are based on voting   Which means that if the validator votes as much as possible  then the overall take will be as large as possible  but then the commission comes in and higher commission will result in less payout to stakers  On validators app  you can see this in the  Skipped Vote    distance from leader   metric   The closer to 0  the better  so  0 40  is better than  1 0    because it represents what percentage of votes the validator is missing relative to the very best performer So basically there are two factors  how close to optimally the validator is voting  represented by very small skipped vote    and what commission the validator is taking   Of the two  unless the skipped vote   is very high  the commission will make the larger difference My validator does very well with votes and is consistently within about 0 25  of the very best  represented by values like  0 24  on validators app    But I charge 8  commission Another factor to consider is that concentrating stake in the highest staked validators is bad for the network   it makes it more centralized and reduces its security   So if you want to do what s best for Solana itself  you should probably at least take some stake and spread it around to smaller validators   Maybe something like 3 4 of your stake on big low fee validators and the rest spread to a few smaller validators That s what I did when I started   I picked 6   two in the top 10  two in the 10   30 range  and two in the 30   100 range  in total stake ranking    I found that my best performers were consistently those with low commission or no commission   The overall difference was only like 1  APY but still perceptible Yes the commission can be changed on epoch boundaries by a validator The feeling that I get is that people who know their stuff in the world of crypto are on board which is what is driving price increases and platforms built on Solana   The unwashed masses are still out there unaware
2021-03-29,18.08330268,18.98784228,17.70036375,Elon Musk called  Next stop Mars I don t see any lending platform on Solana  Hopefully soon Sollet is ok  I dislike having to renter passwords  but raydium was a breeze to use  Some there isn t much liquidity some of the swap pairs aren t there  so I swapped SOL to USDC  then USDC to RAY and staked  Pretty easy Sollet and raydium has worked smooth for me  I recommend joining the radium protocol telegram if you are having troubles as the admins are very helpful Not sure if you re being facetious or not    I ve found Sollet Raydium to be difficult compared to Compound or Aave  Mostly because Sollet is not so good and would be better as a browser extension Great  I must have missed Oxygen last time I researched this as it just launched recently They will probably list it eventually since Solana has USDC now It d be hard to scan the wrong QR code  but a customer could also submit a transaction ID  which would be the same as an order number  and the customer support agent could use that instead  however  I should note that any systems that have employees are prone to employee errors  and that that ll always remain true    In real life if you screw up on the job bad enough you get fired  or are required to pay the company damages  or both   That s just life  but the benefit of the blockchain is that it empowers a lot of the little guys to have access to financial opportunities otherwise not available  and to create markets and businesses that would normally require a lot of middlemen and difficult to set up infrastructure Yuppers  raydium easy to use as fuuuu This is very anti community  which is solanas biggest fault ATM  perhaps you want to lighten up I d understand if it were multiple days  Maybe you should post more fundamentals content to drown out the hype of people new to the project Can you imagine being upset about a little excitement and liveliness in this sub for one day  Relax buddy  I m sure you are real fun to be around Oxygen Protocol for lending and Raydium is an AMM Gentelmen  its a pleasure hodling with you For this niche   I would truly support SOL instead of BSC shit stuff Could ve sworn it tasted twenty yesterday   One of those fleeting reaches   Moonward Jaybirdmcfee thanks for your comment  A good thinker  Well  I still think merchants will be reluctant to start this since what if the emplyeee for example due to a lapse in concentration scans the wrong QR code and sends the refund to another customer  What now  The only solution would be to ask that random customer to send back the money  right  You think that they will 100  of the time Hi  Just had this problem on my new Ledger S and figured it out  Seems that the issue was that I had not enabled  blind signing  in the Ledger Solana app  This detail is mention here   https   support ledger com hc en us articles 360016265659 Solana SOL   https   support ledger com hc en us articles 360016265659 Solana SOL I just discovered SOLANA  will look into staking a few hundred coins Refund mechanics can be coded  Here s an example  although it doesn t cover every possible situation  Say a company sells shoes and each of their shoes is cataloged in a blockchain dapp that functions similarly to Amazon  What would that look like 1  A customer accesses the dapp  pays for some shoes with whatever cryptocurrency the marketplace accepts  and a smart contract executes to place the funds into an escrow until the merchant s account verifies that they have the item in their catalog and are able to ship it  otherwise  the funds are automatically sent back after X minutes have passed 2  It turns out the Merchant has the item in stock  so it s immediately shipped through a process which could be verified through other outside sources  or code 3  The escrow releases the funds to the merchant s own within a special wallet  This special wallet labels and timestamps transactions in a nice GUI and provides limited access and visibility of funds to different users in the organization 4  The customer eventually receives the shoes but sees that they are damaged  and so  like on any other website the customer goes and reads the refund policy  sees that he s in his rights for a refund  and contacts the company s customer service through the same dapp in the part one of this scenario 5  A customer service representative sees that a user posted a complaint with pictures of damaged shoes and a QR code  or something similar  that matches a transaction in their specially made wallet  Clicking on the customer s address within the wallet shows that the customer has bought from them many times in the past successfully  and that the customer is generally a good actor  and not a malicious scammer   so the customer service rep presses a refund button which re sends the original funds back to the customer End of Scenario The fact its showing up in the block explorer should give you some peace of mind  I ve had multiple issues with binance us and switched to ftx us  all you can do is wait on support for it to show up in your binance wallet I believe Between 5 usd and 15  Long this project is awesome  Hold tight and don t ever sell for lower than you paid  HODL if you can i think the uptick in memes also has to do with Solana co founder tweeting a meme contest Thanks for the reply I ve had issues with binance taking quite a long time to accept withdrawals deposits  but my funds have never gone missing  Give it time  and make sure you sent to the right address I won t take offense with this post  because clearly  the one meme I made was dope I mean  we  are  in a bull market  but the majority of large cap alts have been sideways the entirety of March   so I actually appreciate a little bit of good news in meme form To each their own I see nothing wrong with the memes  just need a daily price speculation thread or something for all of them You follow different people than me  I almost never see SOL mentioned Yes we can chill and discuss the fundamentals I m curious when Solana will switch to execution of BPF contracts in Linux kernel as opposed to current execution in user land  It would give a big boost in performance and it would be nice to see how much more than 50k TPS it could achieve then This season will focus on the movers and shakers within the Solana ecosystem  Here s a sneak peek of the first episode featuring the CEO of Star Atlas  Michael Wagnerhttps   twitter com solana status 1376326316056748035 s 21 Hey man  Thank you very much  I found the migrate info and successfully transferred to new pool  Appreciate your help Based on  SizeChad on Twitter lmao Ive been staking over a month or so  I just checked balances  they still are around the same I m in for about 275 at 18 usd  Hoping for a lot of upside in the future LEEESS        GOOOOOOO Suckers Nicely done   love it Yes outisratwell is the Artist  she is dope Lol

2021-03-30,18.89140274,20.86947517,18.89140274,Yeah I know I was like  hm  it goes to 16  drops to 12  then goes back to 16     I should just sell at 16 and buy at 12 next time   But I didn t because it never works out that way    once I figure out the pattern  the pattern is gone No  transaction fees are not 100  burnt   Only a fraction is burnt I know right  I m having difficulty figuring this out      No problem  here s an incorrectly worded answer that just makes it more confusing  15 upvotes Yes you need to delegate the account  I probably would add all sol to get max rewards  I delegated to moonlet but use who your prefer just stay outside the top 12  Also it take an epoch to activate the stake and another to deactivate the stake  Epoch is about 3 days  Make sure to leave 1 sol for transaction Yes you need to delegate the account  I probably would add all sol to get max rewards  I delegated to moonlet but use who your prefer just stay outside the top 12  Also it take an epoch to activate the stake and another to deactivate the stake  Epoch is about 3 days The CEO Anatoly is hyper focused on improving the tech and putting out working protocols  Crypto Twitter is just now starting to coalesce around Serum with the recent  COPE airdrop Seems like YOU haven t used any of these projects I put current fair value just below BNB which would be around  150  So DCA ing on any red days is a no brainer  I d buy in small increments twice a week and bigger buys on short term corrections  I watched it from  3  then thought  7 was high and DCA d but ended up buying the majority of my stack at  13 14  Now s not the time to be cheap lol  Get in and hold Either you have a good team of people helping you to answer people under your name  or you have the dedication necessary to actually reply to people about SOL on reddit  On the next pull back I ll put another sizeable amount behind you  This is the dedication you want in a founder  Thank you for taking the time to reply  the nasdaq analogy hit home 1  I think SOL s userbase is growing organically and as more Devs try building on Solana  it will start the real snowball effect  Most of what made DeFi summer a boom is now stifled by ETHs fees  Eventually the market will see you can do that and more on Solana  2  The issue is there is heavy competition and it s still up for grabs  People are waiting on DOT  waiting on Cardano  testing Terra  migrating to BSC  etc  Solana devs desperately need to improve the UX for Serum based DEXs  This is already happening so it s only a matter of time 3  FTX is still pretty unknown but growth is amazing  Despite that  It s the  2 exchange  IExpect much more in the future 4  Technologically and adoption wise  I d put fair value SOL at Tether s marketcap  below BNB  which would give it a price of about  150  I think that s 100  doable this market cycle and we could see higher values if a 2017 like frenzy starts 5  I found out about SOL after realizing DeFi functionality was doomed if it were to continue on ETHEREUM  I stumbled on a medium article from FTX about Serum  Read more about SOL and once I got over the pains of adjusting to the awkward UX  I fell in love lol I don t mean to disparage ADA and DOT  It s just those projects aren t live yet beyond staking  They ve reached impressive highs with only a fraction of what Solana has  After I realized this I went from watching SOL to becoming a full on advocate and holder Personally I am pretty bullish on Cardano and Polkadot as well  I run a stake pool on Cardano and think using Haskell to build is a good decision  Polkadot  or rather Substrate  of which Polkadot is an instance  is an awesome building block tool  However  I agree Solana has had a lot less hype and is potentially getting ready to roll app wise quicker atm  however atm changes fast here  Also I do think BNB like progress might be the model to follow for Solana I hope so The craziest part to me is how SOL is currently everything Cardano  Polkadot and ETH 2 0 promise to be but still less valuable  Hype is incredibly strong in crypto but Solana s growth is very clear  There will be a parabolic run like no other once the market realizes this  With the exception of BNB  no other top coin has an entire worldwide exchange behind it either Stake and HODL indeed Wait   every single one is burnt  Wouldn t that mean eventually supply becomes limited Sounds like a good endorsement for me  I just went from 100 coins to 360  Will see where it is in the next 18   24 months Good summary  Thanks None   I am 100  focused on Solana Solana has a deflationary issuance schedule starting out at 8  for the first year and decreasing by  15  until it reaches 1 5  after around 11 years  from which point on it will remain constant  https   forums solana com t solana inflation design overview 920   Inflated SOL supply is distributed to those staking  95   with a small portion going into a treasury to fund development of the Solana ecosystem  5    Solana transaction fees are paid in SOL and burnt FTX US  https   FTX US  is not built on SOL  You re thinking of their DEX that is built on SOL I haven t run into any issues I couldn t solve relatively quickly on Raydium  and at this point the experience is extremely smooth Prince song  1999 Wow  x1000 for the seed investors ther is no other project that

back down  as it s been doing for weeks   Womp womp  Hoping it comes back down so I can get back in Dude I m so happy with Solana  In November me and my friends were exploring mid cap alts that could have some cool potential  Stumbled on upon Solana  thought their new consensus protocol was cool then bought a shit ton  I m shocked by the price moves  Originally was planning to get a cheeky 10x and dip but now we re both long term holders  Solana to the moon What s the meaning here 1  Adoption  but this is the case for all cryptocurrencies 2  The state of mind of the development team is an essential factor  I think it takes time for something to grow  Along the way  you will get setbacks  Therefore you need to stay strong in your vision  And communicate with your community to keep a solid foundation  For example  Solana is a big competitor of Ethereum  They won t allow Solana to come into their space without a  fight  3  Solana was launched in March 2020  So to me  it s relatively new  And for a while  DiFi was focussing on Ethereum  With the heavy gas fees  people are now looking for alternatives  where speed and costs are essential  Solana brings speed and cheap transaction fees  Although 50000 TPS still need to be proven 4  I have no idea  But I like the crypto 5  Via the KIN community  I was holding a bag of KIN since 2017  After the crash in 2018  I never looked at it  Suddenly I got messages KIN is up 10   KIN is up 20   so I had a look at what the F was going on  As I dug deeper into why KIN was moving  I found information on Solana Great write up and explanation  Also I threw away 100  BTC when an old computer crashed in 2011 so don t kick yourself too much  Very few people saw this coming  If you don t mind me asking what other coins   projects are you watching Trying to  but it s tough Yes I can  Can you When OXY Ath Can you be happy Solana deserves 90  ATH Biggest bubble in my portfolio https   i imgur com ojC3uBZ png  https   i imgur com ojC3uBZ png LFG    To the We hit  20 Hell yeah My KIN is still stranded in Eth land  Gotta check up the worhmole progress  thanks for reminding me Yeah man   i started buying SOL in Jan when it was around 5 7   noticed around 2 5   Solana goes 50   sooner than we think   i think same moon applies to the other solana coins like KIN  Oxy  Ray  SRM 1  Time really  as with all crypto  Continued development from the team as well as community involvement  2  You tubers shilling solana   also would love to see an official wallet 3  I didn t hear about FTX us until this year  it sucks I can t access FTX  but I suppose once the DEXs  raydium mangomarkets serum  get going you won t need to  4  Unknown and speculation only gets you so far 5  I found out about so ironically through a YouTube video on REN  and the guy talking about get kept saying  and they are going to be hooking up with solana soon  and I was like WTF    WTF IS SOLANA     Also I saw another video on Sam on why he chose to put serum on Solana and pretty much just started researching from there  I saw they had a BUNCH of projects being built and knew I need to own it as compared to Cardano sitting at 35 billion at the time This is no longer valid lol  we breached to new ATH I don t even know where to start  When comparing it to other coins  you will find advantages and disadvantages  I like SOL because it has a different approach  Using PoH is diverging from 98  of projects that are PoW or PoS  Is it the winner horse  Difficult to say  but if it is  its growth is going to be exponential  It has its own technological challenges  so this PoH comes with other unique features that need to be developed  So comparing it with DOT is difficult because they have different approaches  DOT will be based mostly in parachains doing the work but leveraging the security of being part of DOT  SOL is about providing muscle TPS directly in its blockchain I can see x5 in 2021 when compared to BTC  I don t like to look further away because the bull market could disappear in less than 12 months  Who knows Get out of Binance bro  I moved everything already a month ago  It was such an utter mess Mango Markets  live now  and Oxygen will have lending You will earn a percentage of your SOL every three days or so  paid directly into your stake account   Yearly you should gain around 9   more if compounded   That will probably be dwarfed by the gains or losses in SOL value though  so if you like SOL long term  you buy it  hold it  and keep it staked to earn interest on it while you are holding it As an example  I had a 1000 SOL account staked since early mid February   It now has 1011 SOL in it  so I earned 11 SOL over that time period just by keeping my SOL staked So what s the reward for staking  I can t figure it out
2021-03-31,19.10168383,19.79580246,18.15625631,Solana has a deflationary ISSUANCE SCHEDULE What he said is not false  but that doesn t mean the total supply is going down either Oxygen is supposed to offer what you re looking for  and while they just had their IEO  they re not up and running yet Seed investors  VCs pre ICO  got  02 why avoid the top 12   I m going to everstack for the 0  fee but what is the most profitable way to stack Follow  cyrii_MM for more info from the creator  I would also follow  SBF_Alameda and  CryptoKaleoRough Background   After  COPE was airdropped to  OGs   which were people that had verified their vote for COPE in the Solana Hackathon  liquidity began to pour in  Someone made a COPE USDC market on Serum Bonfida  and within a day of the airdrop  someone hosted a COPE USDC Fusion Pool on Raydium  All of this liquidity  influencer driven hype  and the relative scarcity of new SPL tokens  has made this project a short term winner  The project s info is on  this site   http   www unlimitedcope com whitepaper I think it was only for people who voted for the cope project during the serum x Solana hackathon There are fake solstarter websites on google Please be warned How about maps  Also a project on solana  Low mc and relatively cheap ICO was  22  round up   its 100x which sounds extremely good but where you getting 1000x Yeah you re right  never touched solanahttps   github com t 900 a odoo solana payments Awesome thanks Ah ok   That is the refund of all the fees associated with those transactions   They failed to inform people properly about the fee structure  so they ended up just paying everyone back From Bonfida s Twitter feed 1  You will see the pool tokens in your wallet 2  The mint of the pool token is

you buy OXY during it s IDO That sounds pretty good Is this website no longer operational Cool  thanks The chain is healthiest if all staked SOL is split across as many validators as possible  Size of the validator does not matter for profit  On average  over time  every validator receives the same   reward on their staked SOL if they stay online and functioning well  See validators app for factors that can influence profit Thank you Thank you for your very fine answer   I have one more  smaller question though  Does the size of the validator have an influence on the profit you get for delegating to them  Also  to be sure  you re saying that splitting my SOL to different delegator is healthier for the chain  right Yeah once I saw Circle included them in their USDC multichain support I felt like they were going to start getting some visibility  It would not surprise me to see Visa do a write up   I can t see them sticking with USDC on Ethereum once they look at the other chains they ve added Thanks u Smartmud  Absolutely  Kreechures is an NFT on the Solana blockchain  Gen 0 Kreechures began generating last Friday  26 March  and will continue until we hit the max  20k Kreechures arrived  After that  the only Kreechures that will be created are Gen 1 2 3 90 that are a result of breeding   amp  x200B Let me know if you have any questions about Kreechures or the process we use to create the token  images  etc  Sharing is caring Is it inflationary or deflationary   It s deflationarily inflationary   Glad to clear that up Another one   https   solible com  https   solible com https   www kreechures com    It s using Kin  which is an SPL token on Solana How can we invest  Is there an option of private sale This is what I m looking for  I m defi 100   and if I can avoid a centralized exchange I want to  Ftx is better  Do they accept usdc on sol You can always check    https   solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io     so you know when the Epoch ends  amp  you can withdraw your Stake An Epoch is around 2   3 Days  Your Stake will ALWAYS go through what we call   WarmUp    Before getting Fully Staked   amp    CoolDown    When you UnDelegate your Stake Awesome that s what I wanted to hear  Thanks because if you used an ACH to fund the account they hold the asset for 10 days before they let you move it out of the platform  this is to prevent chargebacks Yes  Some ERC20s   ETH can be converted directly  Link MM to sollet io wallet  Then within sollet  click receive  amp  there s a converter  You have to pay gas tho MetaMask has a bridge That s a fair point about the fees  but for anyone who is coming here and asking that type of question  I assume they are capable enough of understanding that answer  and it provided perfect clarity Binance us They said that transaction fees are burnt   That s incorrect   They are partially burnt The original question was from someone obviously uncertain and looking for clarity   The provided answer was unclear and used confusing and nuanced wording   It was the kind of answer that is  technically correct   except the part about burning transaction fees   although even that is  technically correct  if you want to play the semantics game of  he didn t say how much was burned   but unhelpful to someone who is trying to get clarity The validators with 0  commission are running at a loss right now trying to gather stake   It is also possible that they own a lot of SOL on their own and run their own validator   In that case  it doesn t matter what commission they choose because all the SOL is going to go to themselves anyway   So maybe they then choose 0  in hopes of attracting some stake that they can take advantage of someday At any rate  validators with 0  commission will eventually raise it once they have collected enough stake so that they can finally make some SOL   So don t expect 0  commission to last   Forbole is a good example   they were 0  commission for a while and just switched to 9  commission The reason for a large number of 10  commission validators is because a lot of them were started by people taking advantage of the Solana Foundation passing out stake as part of a program to attract new validators   I suspect the foundation put a requirement that these validators charge no more than 10  commission  and most of them chose to go with the maximum to get the most SOL out of the foundation stake delegation   They are all probably aware that they have little chance of attracting other stake but they started a validator knowing that the compromise was that they d get guaranteed stake from the foundation and are happy to just make the most they can off of that In the ranges of commission between 0  and 10   you have a variety of commissions chosen by each validator to try to maximize their growth while at the same time maximizing current SOL take where they can get it   Everyone has their own way to decide what the best commission is I have tracked the gains on several stake accounts and sampled a lot of data   It turns out that the difference between 0  commission and 8  commission is only about 1  difference in yearly earnings on stake   So it actually doesn t even matter all that much what the commission is    unless you are super concerned with every last percent of return   You have to balance the needs of the Solana network  spreading stake to some validators with a slightly higher commission  against your desire to earn the absolute best possible return  down to a 1  difference Thanks for the heads up The new solanabeach io is very buggy and gives incorrect data sometimes   It has been having particular difficulty with the metrics it uses for computing  uptime   a poor choice of wording  it s not uptime in any traditional sense of the word  Check out validators app if you want to see much more reliable data about validators This is the best thread that can help you choose the best Validator to stake your SOL too  https   forums solana com t validator information thread 577  https   forums solana com t validator information thread 577    Key Features to put in mind to choose your valdiator     Uptime and performance stats from TdS  amp  Mainnet Beta  Duration of involvement with Solana  Links to contributions  features  github issues  bugs uncovered  blog posts  to the Solana ecosystem  Experience outside of Solana Step finance is creating that solution as we speak  Check them out on twitter  The creator is a super nice dude I tend to move coins to Binance  swap over to SOL on there and withdraw SOL to my wallet and use that to buy whatever coin on Serum  A bit longwinded but gets the job done Thanks for that  Yes  could add the serum to the wallet  Should be able to dex what I want now  Cheers Are there any good sites for defi tracking on solana analogous to zapperfi or zerion etc FTX US  https   FTX US  supports withdrawals of BTC and ETH to Solana FTX FTX US Bianance  if you have a metamask wallet there s also a converter if you connect it to a sollet wallet Mango Markets looks promising  It seems strange you can t trade SOL on there but I guess that will be coming Solana uses PoS which roughly means the people with the most stake have the most control of the network  The ppl holding  gt   33  of staked supply  currently 12 validators  can halt the network  This would clearly be very bad  for network health and for the SOL price For delegators this means Do not delegate to a single validator  spread your SOL across multiple Do not delegate to the validators who already have enough power to stop the network  scroll down https   solanabeach io validators  it has a line showing how many validators make up the 33  stake  Yes this may mean that in the short term you are not maximising profit but remember that a healthy network will in the long term  which isn t that long in crypto  be much more valuable than an unhealthy  centralised network No worries  It s great to connect with folks in the community   Plus no sleep and lockdowns My fault king  I don t even programz Does not exist yet I believe I picked them as well  currently looking into the uptime issue I m here from Kin as well   I was setting up Ray LP when I realized SOL is pretty awesome to transact with after getting hosed on ETH fees   I hope feel like I may have stumbled into another one early   Anyone have any realistic projections 100  agreed  We definitely need to diversify the staking providers pool  So go to solana beach and pick one of the smaller ones that have good traits Nothing in my profile or usd history does it say anything about a lock That s one of the drawdowns  Since there isn t an official wallet by the team  Although    the community really is pushing out sins sick wallets  Otherwise it s a solid chain Thanks a lot I know very little about Solana  I was expecting the  epoch  to take only some minutes  It would be great if that was informed on the UI to set user s expectations I look at validators app  and go with a combo of top Performance fee below 10  and not in the top 1 3 of stake delegated  check the solanabeach io validators tab for this info    I also want a validator with a website that looks somewhat professional Yeah you need to wait until the epoch is over  Usually about three days and we still have another 18hrs left for us to start a new epoch  There s a  cool  down period after you un delegate Moonlet has 92  uptime  less than 1  delegation  and 0  fees  That s what I went with  Evertstake was 90   over 3   and 0  respectively  Look for high uptime  low delegation  and low fees  https   solanabeach io validators
2021-04-01,19.41568124,20.3615394,18.84424514,Is sollet secure You can withdraw your ETH to the Solana chain  I ll check USDC next time I login over there Now were talking I m a huge ETH ecosystem and defi fan  although more defi than anything I ve got a lot of kin  and looking to get involved in the raydium defi platform Why do they do that  Seems very inconvenient if you need the money So it takes 3 days to withdraw your money To be clear  I m not looking for ways to buy solana  I m looking for ways to get ETH on the solana chain to trade on raydium Do you mean  ETH on the solana chain  or selling eth to solana I want wrapped eth or usdc on the solana chain There are other Solana Ecosystem Projects that have shorter cool down periods for staking providing liquidity  I recommend checking out Raydium if you haven t already Stealthex  was sketched out by it at first  However it s working smoothly  I prefer it over MM because you aren t limited to 0 1 Eth The app looks and works very good with my Ledger Any changes you ll support the tokens on the Solana chain as well I am just thinking out loud  Would it be possible to manage Raydium pools and farms in the app  And you definitely need to add swapping Is it happening again  that is to bad  I thought it was fixed 1  amp  x200B Have same issue  while trying to make an order on serum I never see Solana mentioned in the app s features or release notes  Android    why is that What is a locked account This is an awesome update ı think it s gonna be star in 2021 You can simply connect your Ledger to Moonlet and start staking if you didn t already  Enjoy orca so giving out NFT Guppies to early users also u know when i can a kreechure needs to be listed on binance so my bags can pump  i know u see this cz ADA daedalus Wallet have that info And u can withdraw anytime u want even If its staking Yeah  That is how I noticed ALGO when Circle started using it  Since than I have been looking for a second similar coin to hold long term which is apparently SOL  So yeah  is getting visibility Just trying the Alpha version of the Dashboard   Pretty awesome   Hope they can show the value in Pool Stake soon yes solana  ftx  and serum all support spl USDC T  The easiest cheapest way  imo  is to deposit your erc20 stables into FTX  amp  withdraw spl USDC T to whatever Solana wallet you re using They could certainly be more clear about a lot of things  For instance the fee burn you mention  I don t see anywhere where they break down the percentage that is burned  only that a portion of it is  Maybe it changes dynamically  but I certainly can t tell from the information I ve seen My intention was not to make it seem like they were lying   I don t think they were lying  just not being as clear as I think the situation called for I think it s going to be continued source of confusion to many people that Solana has inflation but that it s reducing every year   In addition  it has deflationary forces  irretrievable loss of SOL due to user error  and burned transaction fees  that need to be taken into consideration too   I think we need very clear answers to avoid further confusion   I just don t think the answer given was clear enough  that is all    Deflationary issuance schedule  is just not a very clear answer to the question of  is it inflationary or deflationary  in my opinion   So I offered critique   That is all
2021-04-02,19.08463141,19.82457274,18.568419,Well bro the thing about Solana is that is slightly new but there are a ton of resources money wise to build on Solana and many devs joining in with sick projects under construction  Like MAPS an app like Google maps for traveling where u can have money  lend  borrow change currencies  Will be huge since the app is already huge  Also Raydium  RAY is currently so small where u can swap tokens also stake and do yield farming of different pairs  Solana will be huge man  It has the hard part done which is an insanely fast blockchain that only gets faster so any application built on it will also be lightning fast It works now  It seems like I needed to run the app on the ledger without having ledger live open  Ledger live was causing the app on the ledger to close somehow   If this is happening to you  try to start the app on the ledger device without opening ledger live EVM support will come if the devs want a mass user migration to Solana  And   I think they do  Anatoly said in a Clubhouse awhile back that it s something being worked on but will take some time  There was also an interview on YouTube where he said EVM support would work as a smart contract within Solana and anything ported over would simply use more gas  SOL  which would be pennies  This was an older vid from 2020  To lazy to link but you can find it  so not sure if that idea ever developed Hello  I m new to Solana and I d like to stake some SOL  which validators do you recommend Thanks in advance what article i don t see any link By   locked   you mean Staking  Well you can Unstake whenever you want BUT keep in mind that you ll have to go through what is called CoolDown  that may take till the the end of current Epoch during which you asked to unstake The same thing happens when you  Stake   Delegate to a validator you go through what is called   WarmUp   before your SOl enter the network  amp  start getting the APY earning You re Referring to the Fees the validator s  take when you Stake your SOL with The Validato s  take a small    each validator sets its own    of the Earning that comes from your SOL Stake  So your main SOL Stake remains Intact  only   of the earning from Staking is what the validator s  will take   Your Question    If you are staking would you want the commission to be 100  or 0         Answer    Of course the lower the commission   Fee     of the validator the better A 100  commission   Fee means  you get 0  earning on your SOL Stake A  0  commission   Fee means you get 100  earning on your Sol Stake Glad you figured it out Not certain of reward cycles  I would guess daily as blocks are validated and Validators reap rewards It has a warm up period of 2 3 days before your staked SOL begins accruing rewards and a cool down period of 2 3 days after being unstaked I will Thank you Thank you What is serum then  It seems like a lot of app are built on top of serum Validators are incentivized to operate in alignment with the network otherwise  and penalized if they act maliciously   the bad actors will lose a percentage of their coins as well as anyone staking with them Thank you for the details And I learn that Solana doesn t support EVM for the better or the worst   Any idea if it is on the roadmap or if they are gonna build their own stuff  Like dfinity I will Great thanks  This list is gold Serum Dex  Raydium for swapping  Oxygen for lending etc   Kin for in app currency  Maps for travel  Just to name a few It does say that in the article It s how much they take from your earnings  You want it to be 0  Most validators have it set at 10   it seems  Its a balance of finding a low one but also one that you trust not to do something nefarious and lose your precious coins Massive air quotes on the  gas https   solible com Couldn t find anything under that name  anything to share Also how long is your SOL locked to the network  and what is the reward cycle times on the network Mango markets for leveraged tradingSerum for the DexRaydium is the AMM  You can provide liquidity here and get dual fusion rewardsOxygen Protocol for lendingAll of these tokens use Solana for  gas  fees I agree with the comments and also suggest you check out this video from Sam BFhttps   m youtube com watch v qci0_O2Qtr8 amp feature youtu beHighly informative and explains the limitations of other chains eg ETH Here is a link to the  UI  https   www spl token ui com     and you ll want to ensure you set the quantity to 1  decimals to 0  and turn off future minting  This is probably only helpful when minting a small number Documentation on the token program  and NFTs on Solana  is  here  https   spl solana com token example create a non fungible token I think the market is just now starting to realize the genius of Solana and its devs  So not much exists and a lot of what you see on ETH  are projects built from 2018 2019 blowing up in 2020 and beyond  SOL projects are just in that early phase and simply not fully built out yet  Realistically  I think you start to see all those lending farming optimizer type apps on Solana over the next few months Check out Mango Markets for lending Now if the SOL team happened to drop that EVM support Also check out the ecosystem here https   solana com ecosystem You can use the SPL token program to mint NFTs  You ll set the quantity to 1  decimals to 0  and turn off future minting  There is a UI for it if you re just doing a few or you could use the spl token CLI if creating more More than willing to talk more about this if you d like I highly recommend you check out serum  fully decentralized exchange built on solana   I also recommend following Anatoly Yakovenko  solana  cofounder  and Sam Bankman Fried  ceo of FTX  serum advisor  on Twitter  The solana podcast is a great resource for learning about solana and its ecosystem  https   podcast solana com   Welcome to the Solana family That s the problem  it SAYS it s in an open order but there s nothing on my orders screen  Trust me when I say I ve been over every inch of the dex and wallet  I ve even tried other Solflare compatible dex s and nothing shows up on there  Just this morning it started saying I need to migrate old orders but even THAT says I need to cancel orders and settle  There s no place to cancel my orders because I don t actually have any open orders  It s like it s just stuck Check the open orders  it needs to be cancelled from there  Once done  amp  you still have the same error  just refresh  amp  unlink   link your wallet a gain  amp  try As for SolFlare  here is their support group in Telegram   https   t me SolFlare _Wallet  https   t me SolFlare_Wallet ideally finding something to do the latter  I see a lot of arguments that anything running of the ethereum block chain is in efficient so I just wanted to see if the same concept was offered or even executable on SOL Could you say that again I mean do you have something to read about what you have stated I did link a source  POLYGON network sir APi3 What you recon V link Um   coinbase plz Solible Which networks allow that fees  can you link a source Do you mean minting an NFT as a user via a frontend or coding a program  smart contract  which would mint an SPL NFT If it s the former you could head to https   solanaproject com and see if there s anything that lets you do that If it s the latter  I would start by going to the documentation and take it from there https   docs solana com developing programming model overview as i understand it that is correct if one does not already exist  almost every NFT I ve seen leverages the Ethereum blockchain  however i have seen it offered under TEZOS as well Someone correct me if I m wrong  but there would have to be a project or protocol that runs on the Solana blockchain in order for you to mint an nft off of it Are you sure it s not showing up under the  open orders  tab I ve been trading on Serum for a few months now  no issues Not familiar with solflare but can you reimburse your wallet using your seed phrase  Or do you not have one because it s just a json file Yeah I ve tried that a million times and it doesn t do a thing Have you tried clicking settle all funds I m not familiar with solflare but have been using sollet and it s running smoothly  You could tweet at them and explain your situation Moonlet helped me get a decent amount of Zil off of my atomic wallet  wouldn t let me withdraw Zil I had unstaked and there customer service is non existent   quick and painless  I know stake all my SOL there  very happy with Moonlet The problem is it s stuck in a non existent open order on Solflare DEX and I m logged in with Solflare wallet  I can t import that wallet into Sollet because Solflare gives you a  json file instead of a seed phrase Maybe try on another dex like raydium and do not click automatically approve transactions when signing into your sollet thanks  exactly what I was looking for Yes it is  it s a non custodial wallet  your keys your money
2021-04-03,19.79645158,23.827189,19.78944967,There is still a fee involved  It still is a transaction  Not sure what the confusion is theres no point to put cancelled transactions on a blockchain I m just saying that it s not smart to close the door on anyone if you want the project to be successful no matter how much or how little research you think they have put in  I m sure you re a super nice fellow though Try not to worry for now  Wait for Blockfolio support and see what they say  Could just be an error on their end Nope  It would have been better if OP said nothing at all  If you look at my page you will see I am a genuinely kind hearted individual   and prettty active in a lot of crypto subs that I don t even have a stake in  I just want To help how I can  Sometimes being brutally sarcastic is the only way to have people re think their approach Such as you  who disregards the ZERO  do your own research  OP clearly has put in  but go ahead   guide him to the restroom and hold his wee wee while you guys talk about how rich you ll be and how much you  believe   in the coin    I have SOL since the jump  That s not a brag  that s a fact jack  And it s noneyabueez jnessssss You think eth maxi psyop What a total asshole response  If you are into solana and you want it to succeed you might want to adjust how you deal with people asking pretty basic questions about it  Community is an important component of a project being successful  You need people  This kind of shit isn t going to win anyone over  It would have been better if you said nothing at all Check raydium io It is profitable for now  Fee are very low  APR is high I m not sure of anything at this point  and doubt I ll have answers until Monday  if then  The crypto seems to have just vanished   about  2K worth  I had 2 small transactions go through fine  which is why I decided to send the larger amount  and it vanished  Very frustrating  but I can t even get a transaction   from Blockfolio  They just show that a transaction happened  No details Awesome  Looking into it now Can you hold my hand while I pee  Can you cut the crust off my pb amp j   Can you help me go potty  Oh wait my bad I thought we were in a different sub based on how many favors and daddy and mommy guidance you re requesting Download the solflare wallet and put your coins in it  You can stake directly from the wallet Watch  safemars       They will list on WHITEBIT whitebit crypto  coin I got this image from https   www coinparticle com Positive  There s nothing under open orders  On the front page it says I have unsettled funds in old markets  It s showing 39 000 solana in old markets  which is obviously wrong  I only have 39  and then when I go to my balances it says I have 39 solana in open orders  Then I go to the open orders tab and there s nothing showing up  no matter what OS or browser and no matter how many times I refresh  disconnect and sign back in  I can click settle all funds but it doesn t do anything  doesn t even have me sign a transaction  I doubt it s a problem with Serum itself  I think it s more an issue with Solflare s shitty implementation of it  Probably worth noting I connected to Bonafida to see if it was a UI bug but it s not showing any kind of open balance on there  Just Solflare dex  Says I have 0 88 serum in one wallet  it automatically split that balance and created a new address with  002 for some reason  but that s the only liquid wallets showing up and the bulk of my SOL balance is locked in a nonexistent trade Moonlet io is currently 12 94 APY  they have an app in the app store that can walk you through the process  Write down your keys onto a tangible  secure  physical place  Lose keys and you lose your Solana for life  If you don t understand how that works  don t engage in staking because it s a bit more complex than owning a coin on robinhood  you don t actually own your crypto on those types of platforms since you don t have a wallet  nor keys  Research  read  then study for 3 6 months before getting involved in mining  staking  and storage or wallets True but it s not a meme stock  Invest in the technology  not the charts kin to  01 bb Exodus does not support Staking Sol I would stay away from Solflare  it s a mess  I tried to swap 39 Sol for some SRM but it got stuck in a trade  It shows up under my open order balance but there are no open orders and settling my funds does nothing  Solana is a solid project but Solflare is complete trash  Half of the transactions don t show up and then when they do they disappear or get stuck  I m lucky only lost 39 SOL and not more Unfortunately Blockfolio  Sorry  I accidentally but Blockfi  where I also have an account  lists transactions  but not transaction  s  So it just says yes I moved 20 SOL   bot no other info  I ve contacted their CS  but I m imagining it ll be Monday before I hear back   bottom line is it never made it to SolFlare  although 2 other transactions for smaller amounts did Wow great advice  Been having issues with my ledger and this helped  Thanks CORRECTION   This was Blockfolio  not Blockfi  My mistake  Blockfi has been slow but dependable Blockfolio is where the SOL disappeared I ve had this issue happen with SOL on Bilaxy  Seems to be an issue with the exchanges and not Solana  They will probably have your SOL in their wallet  and will transfer it as soon as you reach out  Good luck mate This issue is likely on Blockfi s end  not Solana s  I ve had similar issues on Binance and FTX  although FTX is pretty fast to confirm withdrawals and deposits   however  these third party asset custodians have their own withdrawal and deposit processes separate from the blockchain   I recommend going to blockfi s transaction history page  or whatever the equivalent is  and looking for the particular transaction in question  Chances are you ll see a transaction status similar to  processing   or  requested Are you sure a second address hasn t been created that s storing your coins  I know a lot of people are having those problems at the moment ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️ I know you mean good  But for the love of God  unless you re dropping thousands upon thousands on a coin  where every cent could mean a big difference   then just buy it if you like the coin because regardless if it goes down it ll go up     all else equal  like many said Time in the market vs timing the market   Unless you don t think it ll ever reach a price higher than it is today   isn t a mean spirited comment  just sannoying  man    do your own research is literally the opposite of what the people be doing  This isn t research That being said  SOL is sauce Doesn t BlockFi take a long time to transfer I just lost 80 SOL transferring them from Blockfi to SOLFlare  Transaction confirmed  SOL is just gone  BEWARE My thoughts  Like most here I am just a fan and not a financial advisor  I believe in the future of this project and the future could be massive  A 6bn market cap currently does not reflect anywhere near the end valuation should we end up running NASDAQ sized order books where  275bn can trade hands in a day   Do your own research of course Im sorry that i throw my money on other cryptos first  Solana was on my watchlist long time before and to invest in something i need infos and opinions what the feel about solana Top is in because a guy wants to know your opinion about if he should invest his  1000 now or next week  You must not believe in the fundamentals of this project  This is adoption  it s a good sign Time in the market  gt  Timing the market  Imo seems its a chrome issue     used the wallet via firefox and worked without issue absolutely Sell everything boys  Top is in when people start asking questions like this in Reddit Kin still isn t at all time highs yet  might be a good buy there I woul not try to time the market  Invest 20  today  20  in 3 days  and son on  In my opinion this is a top 7 project I don t think you can stake in exodus  Try moonlet app or solflare  They both have ledger support we can start with first goal 40 usd Sol is at it s ATH today so I would personally wait for a pull back Not a bad time to get into some Solana ecosystem products  serum  raydium  oxygen  kin  as they are Still below ATHWill need to purchase 1 sol to fund those transactions if trading on serum Dex I bought SOL a few days ago  so far so good VITE  It s a DAG chain  like nano  but has smart contracts  It hosts a DEX called ViteX http   x vite net is the exchange  VX represents ownership in the exchange and pays dividends from trading fees  currently 30    There is a Vite Android wallet that has exchange functionality Currently they re working on v2  which will have distributed secret keeping for trustless crosschain swaps  Dig around for the ViteBridge whitepaper and read about it Definitely a lot of room  people will slowly find out I think I noticed this too a while ago but for me it s only a problem if I have Ledger Live open and in manager mode  if I go to accounts or portfolio it works fine  Using Linux here Hmmm  Might pump the price but the folks who just see Bitcoin and ethereum as the top coins might be timid to adopt  could take a while  Eth will be 10k by end of year https   youtu be hya_GsSf9FE Good old fomo what s the most effective way to move USDC and USDT on Ethereum cross chain to Solana Thank you for the details about MAP No problemo  Does seem a bit rough around the edges compared to the more popular eth nft platforms  but it seems very possible on solana not a financial advice https   staratlas com partners Solana has performed really well last month  hope it will continue growing LOL ok  Here it is https   medium com aave exploring new frontiers with aave 59563ddd2405 Update  Here s a few more detailed screenshots  https   imgur com a cFHJHBN  https   imgur com a cFHJHBN Same   Eth is old tech  it ll still be around and probably 5x but I think Solana will absolutely blow up I am trying to move coin from one account to my HW account and getting this error Anyone know how to fix it Yeah he s slow to get into the video but the info is there and it s a very good video i v never heard of SPL tokens  someone recommended Solible and it seems to be just what i was talking about  it did mention SPL tokens but I d be lying if i said i fully understood what i read but i think i can figure it out  definitely might message ya if i have any questions if you wouldn t mind wow off a brief glance this seems to be just what i was looking for thank you so much Watched first few min  nothing relating to the title of the video  Dislike  Still holding solana though Thanks a lot I jumped one week ago   SOL go to  50 buck Can I start my own validator node on mainnet and expect some sort of rewards to cover at least server expenses  I am US resident so not eligible for special program  Let s say no one stakes in my node so what would be bold move  let s see if it pays off I m interested in this as well  You should definitely spread it around so all your eggs aren t in one basket I have Everstake  Moonlet io  I use their app  so I trust them   and a little bit in certus one and chorus one Definitely keen to find some other trustworthy validators  https   solanabeach io  is helpful I didn t sell all my ETH but I doubled my position in SOL a week ago  I agree I think it s going to have a great month or two
2021-04-04,22.52737075,25.56953325,22.21296864,Very true  However there is work being done to have transistors built on an atomic level Then you got quantum computers on the subatomic level but we are way aways from that moore s law is beginning to fail as we re reaching the physical limits of how small transistors can be Thank you for letting us what the problem was  this way any other person facing your problem will do the same as yours Good luck buddy If we look at Moore s law and attribute it then every 6 months Solana will be more decentralized as the hardware is easier to acquire as it advances Better head to their   Discord     https   discord gg JZAcRKKh  https   discord gg JZAcRKKh      Sollet Section    amp  explain to them your problem in further details Good luck mate how many of those 550 are run by the same person company 550  validators running and all of them have a vested interest in keeping the solana economy safe I think the burden of proof is on you to show why it is centralized and not safe There is constant education and effort going to trying to get people to spread their stake around   When the stake is spread better  it will be even harder to convince 1

just a representation of the decentralized spirit    gt    gt That does not justify tAgreed  goodluck  Yea  tokenizing assets on the chain has many uses and I hope to see where the bright minds take us Funds are safu Market cap is  588 000 000  I think you missed three zeroes In the US your only options on centralized exchanges are ftx us  or binance us  which are very  watered down versions of the real ftx and binance I have nothing bad to say about binance or ftx https   changelly com   https   changelly com  is what I used before I started using the Dex on SOL You can stake your Sol on Moonlet this is the only right answer MY BROTHA       posted about this a few day ago and its been a Dive Solible com is where i landed last on the hunt for a Solana based NFT gateway  since its pretty much the only place i found to do this but there were a few consbesides being cumbersome to read through and difficult to use they only mint  svg and  png files  that means no video files which is out of the question for me at the moment  the other huge one is that this would limit the sales of my NFT s to the  Solible com  https   Solible com  platform which receives a fraction of the traffic that a major platform like Nifty  Opensea  or even Rareble and Superrare  I m looking for solutions right now but it seems to be a Pretty dead end since marketplace can be such an important factor in your financial infrastructure as an up and coming digital artist  I d love to talk solutions and probable leads on other places as I m certain we aren t the only ones with this on the brain I m actually a digital artist myself but there s been a ton of backlash in my local community towards NFT s powered on Ethereum based on environmental concerns so I m struggling to find a more ethical way into the scene why not just use a centralized database for cancelled orders   fee is irrelevant OMG I m so glad I m not the only one with this problem lol thank you so much for the info  I m gonna check serum today and I ll join the discord group after work tonight too  I hope we can get to the bottom of this I can t log in with my wallet because Solflare doesn t give you a seed phrase  Just a json file  And you can t log in to any of the better dex s like dexlab without Sollet and I can t import into Sollet without a seed phrase One thing I should add is  the APR listed  8 23   etc  is a per epoch EPY   Epochs last about 3 days   And payouts go back into the stake account  so in effect the longer you leave your stake in  the more it will compound   My point being  that my numbers did NOT include compounding interest There are around 125 epochs in a year  so your interest will actually compound 125 times per year   Thus the actual return on a validator with 8  per epoch return is about 8 23  per year including compounding   It s also not a huge difference  but just be aware that your yearly results will be a tiny bit better than what I listed because of compounding of interest i looked into  Solible com  https   Solible com  but it says it can only mint  svg or  png files  i need to be able to mint  mov files or at the very least  mp4  the other kicker was doing so seems like it would limit any distribution to that specific platform and I d prefer to list my work on a more active market  if anyone has any further advice I d love to talk more OK  good news   I think I can see exactly what you re talking about   Bad news  my funds are stuck too I have an old open order     in USDT that Raydium is saying I need to settle old funds on  but errors if I try   and in Serum balances it shows an open order  but there are no open orders   and un equal amount unsettled balance  but errors out saying no open order account found when I try to settle I m looking here now https   serum today   balancesAre you seeing the same   I think we can raise this up in the Serum chat room on the Solana discord   Don t worry   this is some very strange edge case that we can likely get to the bottom of I am an active user  and have been for over a month now  The annual percentage rate  APR  or the rewards would be up to 30   based on the percentage of circulating supply staked  For instance  if more tokens are staked from the total circulating supply  then the reward rate would incrementally decrease   Moonlet will be leading with a staking commission promotion of 0  by the end of March  Staking commission is charged only on your APR  Annual Percentage Rate     Once you made an unstake request  you will have to wait for the unbonding period  roughly up to 3 days  to expire  Please bear in mind that you will earn rewards during the deactivating period Source https   moonlet io solana staking What do you see on a more complete serum view like here https   trade dexlab space   v2 my balances How is moonlet io 12 94  APY   They must be paying out to stake accounts beyond the normal Solana staking rewards  which are around 8  right now Even with compounding  the overall APY that will be achieved after 1 year is only 8 32  at moonlet io using purely solana staking rewards How are they coming up with 12 94    Can someone who actually uses their service report on whether this is accurate Hell yeah  Thanks for the big breakdown and the recommendations on validators  I m going to be doing more research  but I fully expect to be staking my solana this week  It s still a little concerning they advertise 12   Very shady in my opinion but again thanks for showing a peak behind the curtain It s not 12    It was 12  a month ago but has dropped   I guess people are happy leaving 12  listed on sites like solanabeach io even though it is incorrect because it looks better and no one is complaining about the misinformation If you dig through ACTUAL DATA you will see that the APY is at best around 8 25  right now   That s if you use a 0  commission validator  there aren t many  that gets the best returns   TBH my validator  Blade Validator  is about the best return validator out there right now and I m not too shy to say it   But the difference between the best and middle of the pack is only about 0 5  APY so we re not talking huge differences here   Your best bet is to spread stake around to give yourself the greatest security and also to help the network by supporting the most validators If you are so inclined  you can research the actual APY using the solana command line client   You can go to solanabeach io  find a validator  click on it  and then find its largest stake account   Then you use the solana command line client to query about that stake account and see its recent returns   That will tell you the APY being achieved by that validator  the APY is the same for all stake accounts staked to a validator  I always pick the largest just because the numbers are biggest and thus least subject to rounding errors  For example  using my validator At solanabeach io  I click the menu icon in the upper right and switch to Validators view Then in the list I see Blade Validator at spot 45   I click on that to go to a details page for that validator   Scrolling down to the Delegators list I see the largest Stake Account at the top of the list and click on it Now I am on a Stake Account Details page  and I go to the Address and use the copy icon to copy the address Then I go to my terminal and use the solana command line client like so to get details of that stake account    solana stake account 7DjqksRVmh3C6UXsRmdKgxN9nRPJQdsQXc7VvEAqpyomBalance  33493 238623923 SOLRent Exempt Reserve  0 00228288 SOLDelegated

 I can see here every epoch for the past 6 epochs and the APY for each epoch It s currently at 8 23    It went up from 7 74  because I just set my commission to 0  last epoch  it was 8  previously   So you can see that the difference in returns from an 8  commission validator and a 0  commission validator is about 0 5  APY   Not a huge difference  but not insignificant either You can do the above with any validator  choosing its largest stake account and then using solana stake account command to find out what kind of APY that validator has been achieving   Here are some examples for the most recent epoch Chorus One  7 40  APYEverstake  8 09  APYmelea xyz  8 17  APYForbole  7 47  APYmoonlet io  7 79  APYEverstake and melea xyz are 0  commission validators which is why they are the best APY in this list   But they re still not as good as my validator   Why   Because my validator has the best vote performance  and vote performance determines overall payout No  I m in Europe 25 Just came out  Needs a month or so to sell off and find a bottom Go read r binance Type proof of history in google and you will find plenty of information  I don t have any particular source as I have been reading in many different places  Good luck It s as safe as any other exchange  But beware of keeping funds on any exchange    examples to research  Mt  Gox  Bitgrail  etc that normal when you have milions fo customer Well  that s not good news  It looks like the only way to stake SOL   so that REALLY sucks  I ll post back here either way to warn others  Thanks for the input I ll post and let you know My experience is good  But there are ppl with complains about there service as well  Especially if you are US citizen Binance or FTX will be fine Trusted for sure   Safe   No one knows   Same as other exchanges SERUM DEX FTW If you plan on holding for 4 years or longer  the current price is meaningless do you know where I can read up more on PoH and how solona works So answer is yes That would be a scam  The official site is https   solstarter org and as of right now there is no information on a token  Be safe out there and protect your coins Is the  co version that claims to be launching this right now legit or not   Looks very fishy  Please let us know  for our safety only five milions people use binance Proof of History  which is different from PoS  stake  and PoW  work   This is the key difference that explains why Solana can do much more and faster than even centralized ethereum clones around there  Yes  I m looking at you BSC Sorry  What is PoH My staking at Binance just ended today  I set up a solflare wallet linked with my Nano X without any problems but now I always receive an error message when trying to create a staking account  Ist always says  Failed to sign with Ledger device  U2F OTHER_ERRORAnyone else facing this error  Tried both on MacOS and Windows with same result  Do I have to change Settings in the Solana App on Ledger NFTs are cool  But they are in such a sad state now  I want to approach them without the hype but all the excitement  What I mean is you can own them and sell them and they don t have to make you a millionaire  NFT is not crypto  If you ask me  It is a product of crypto  It is like how petroleum industry is singlehandedly responsible for several industries like plastics  lubricants and other chemicals not only the fuel we use  Currently crypto are just used like petrol and the byproducts are just evolving  People like Tyler Winklevoss and Elon Musk and others are like oil barons in this space but that won t stop common people from using it  Can you get what I mean here  There is a lot of potential unused here  We should build on with the tools that have been given to us  There are a lot of things that can be done here  I wanna do some things and I will continue to do things  Support me if you can  There are going to be a lot of things in Solana and many other projects  NFTs are not just meant for ingame items and punk art  It is just a representation of the decentralized spirit  That does not justify their price tag  I totally agree with that Idea As far as I know Solana has been delivering more than Polkadot and Cardano  They currently have around 40 billion marketcap and will most likely grow further as the bullrun continues  Therefor I wouldn t try timing the marketcap and focus on the longrun and buy in now  Have fun becoming wealthy If you have SPL tokens on an exchange  that exchange should have SOL available  You can buy SOL with some of your USDC I worry about devoting dev resources to such a fad  but I think ultimately once the market cools off there will be a place for tokenized online collectibles Sadly  no wallet gives some SOL I have USDC SPL Token but on an exchange  I want to transfer them to sollet io You re missing something  You can stake on Binance Are you guys in the US  For some reason I m not seeing this in the Binance US app or website  But it wouldn t make sense for them to offer it in one place and not the other I found some dapp called Solible where there are NFTs Yes you can   https   www binance com en pos YES  This is exactly it  These guys are doing it right  Thanks maybe they changed it now You may try creating a new account on Solong and add token accounts there  if that works  you can simply export that account to sollet Hey mate  it would be great to have something like  opensea io built on Solana Head to Solana Discord  you ll find all the technical support there for your idea to become reality didnt get anything Are you not able to purchase SOL  It s a great investment anyhow Or create an account on Solong and use the same key to restore account on Sollet Nice  I ll check that Create an account on solong  It gives you some SOL  Transfer that You can on binance I think  Maybe ftx too Can you send me the transaction ID info  I can t guarantee I ll be able to help but I can at least take a look at it  otherwise  I can only really recommend what I did before  especially if the transaction is listed as pending  which  in my mind reads as   you re in the back of the queue because of these gas fees my dude Metamarket  https   solana com ecosystem metamarket I agree with everything you re saying here  but I don t think that guys like OP selling buying moves the market much and I don t think that seeing a couple of posts like this are any indication of anything close to a top signal  Threads like these are the standard  and have been the standard  for crypto reddits for years I m not trying to hate on you specifically man just this attitude in general is scary  Solana at an all time high and people jumping in without knowing anything about it is a recipe for disaster Educate yourself on where the solana value is  I personally believe it can go to 40 or 50 this year  but I m holding so I m biased  As is everyone in this sub Reddit  Try to find an objective view  Be absolutely certain about the projects before you do it I hope I have motivated you rather than discourage but I m sorry if I offended you People jumping in naively are the first to sell  Adoption comes with education  People need to look into projects and assess their value themselves  So when the dip comes they can hold through it If you re taking your advice on an investment from the subreddit of the same name you ll struggle I rage purchased some SOL a few days ago after paying massive gas fees on UNISWAP   I feel SOL will be an improvement SOL gonna go sky high  Coins Tokens in current day are going to explode at a rapid pace because the blockchain is now open to developers and over improvers  Ethereum is the super highway but altcoins are growing a set at a record pace  A pace that is eager to implement a change in the world and a standard on the block  Competition is fierce for value services and bringing them to the Blockchain for people to use and adopt is mind blowing  Don t wait  Get in now   round 2 wont wait for you this time Solana is somehow untethered to Bitcoin right now  It s basically the only coin in the green that isn t a stablecoin I know how to mint NFT s on Solana but didn t bring myself to do it yet  Would love to hear about it if you found an easier way to do that  Plus storing the content on some decentralized storage is what is bugging me to implement  Are you a dev or a creator  I would love to work with you to make an NFT Damn I didn t realize it was that high 12 What s the avg apy staking sol Solana is the shit  I just sold some of my ethereum for it  Super fast and the amount of dapps being built on the network is really promising Here is what happend  I was browsing sollet and saw you could convert SPL to ERC20  Somehow I left clicked by accident and my cursor was on send  It initated a transaction and I rejected it in MetaMask  The funds were still sent to some native loader address  I have the transaction now showing pending and tried to cancel but its just stuck  Who knows if the funds will even revert back to my account if it goes through Damn I have a good amount in blockfolio  Going to wait for an update to move it around Yes  sol will also be used to pay any transaction fees Hmmm ok I will try that  it will always be SOL for the creation fee Moonlet is a mobile wallet app that allows you to stake nah i was jk Na it will add it for you  Keep in mind it will deduct the small sol fee that it takes to create a wallet  About 35 cents usd Thank you  You are a patient man clearly m     I appreciate I m not sure what to make of this so I ll just say good day sir As if I would have acted any different   It was all in satire   ‍ ️ I am sorry that it seemed I was that anti    I gladly willHelp in any way  I suppose I the lines have gotten a littleBlurred as to  what is where and when on the hierarchy of time allocation when it comes to all the craziness in the crypto sphere   But based on my own credibility and who my grandfathers  lost both of them recently  know the Man of integrity that I am to be with ample foresight  would trust in a decision I made to invest in such coin  It doesn t matter how much I know to a random person on  The internet they will question me and eventually look up n ore shjt    hence      the whole DYOR sloganWhat I mean is  I see my wrongdoings in how I handled the situation     But yes I want solana to be successful       Rather have a certain IQ sscorw if the team members as well tho ya Truce  This is out of hand Please elaborate I gave you half of those awards to see how far you d take thisworth every penny spent what the fuck      hahahahaha this is so petty onm both ends  at least the xxvii guy is trying to make your sub more forward thinking  while you are seemingly a victim  trigger culture  clearly you guys are virgins  and my mans delight is smashing mad pus s x SDDDD if  had coins id award all his comments lmfao I don t see any awards for you little missy no one is rooting for you Try adjusting the gas fee in metamask  then confirming that Fair enough  You re free to like or dislike any vibe you wish  The point I m trying to get across is that a crypto project with a helpful and welcoming comunity has a better chance of thriving  As a holder this is what I want for SOL  I m sure it s what you want as well  It s not enough to be a day one holder and know your shit  You should be disseminating info to anyone who will listen  If you re not able to play an active role in the development of whatever the project is  this is a way for you contribute to it s success  And it s easy if you have knowledge about the project  which I assume you must  You did the research  You know how to  Congratulations  Guess what  My grandpa doesn t know how to  I still want him to buy SOL  You do too  He should be able to come to a forum about it and ask even the silliest of questions and get reasonable answers from a friendly individual  If that s not you or you re having a bad day or whatever  just say nothing  Or better yet  try making yourself feel better by doing a solid for another human being  I think you ll find that works too lol no idea  but a great response to OP I turned all my ETH into Solana  and I haven t regretted it  but I recommend you actually test the network yourself as seeing is often better than believing Look  if you are chasing APY  then checkout wanchain  some of the wrapped stablecoin pairs pay 50   APY  I don t mean to shill  wan though  just holding sol is enough for most people ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️ whos giving me awards wtf ROFL Glad I bought mine between January and a few weeks ago  DCA for me beyond this point  Also it aint going io and up  it will likely dip below 20 again I m excited to see who will win the war of the downvotes on this one Lmfaooooo i wonder how it feels to be so authoritative smashing on your sticky Cheeto finger keyboard While you yell up the Basement stairs for another hot pocket  and to bring you that new video game you ve been asking for Grow the fuck up  don t pamper all these people who are too lazy to spend L I T E R A L L Y under a minute s time to Google whether the same kindergarten grade question has been asked by a smooth brainer already  While everyone else is holding his hand  you can put it inside your ass along w your personality seems to be

clown Yeah  we don t need you or this attitude around here Look  I admit that I was acting out of impulse and definitely due to real life irritations   and I shouldn t have said the stuff I did  but I do stand by my viewpoint tbat a list such as OP s is asking us to sell him on why we should deserve him to be a part of the community  I don t like that vibe  Regardless  I appreciate the civil

out that you sound like my friends and family did 10 years ago when I told them about Bitcoin and the upcoming defi revolution  By all means  if you don t have the vision and think this is flawed  stay away  You mentioned earlier not knowing what was meant by 33   Have you read up on Solana clusters and how they work  What makes you think the network is centralized  How many nodes would be decentralized Anatoly  how big in GBs is Solana block chain right now  Having all those consensus votes on chain is not going to make it grow too fast No issues and both a very secure  Makes sure you set up 2FA I have used Binance for years with no issues  I prefer to support FTX now because they have invested massively in solana It s been a great month Using Nano X  Yes  started the App  already required for opening the wallet in Solflare   Have to confirm Access on the Ledger and it works  Even the withdrawl from Solflare back to Binance worked fine  confirmed by Ledger   I just struggle with creating a staking account Did you start the Solana app on the ledger device though  And verify it s running fine  Are you using ledger X or nano S Lower price  less economic incentive to run a node  Less nodes running That s what I ve tried  I even tried on my Windows Laptop connecting the Ledger with this device for the first time  No Ledger Live installed there but same still same result  Now send back the majority to Binance and staked again  Left a small amount on solflare to keep on trying does 150 month get you the requirements necessary as specified above

good read on the topic https   news earn com quantifying decentralization e39db233c28e Is that a pipe dream or have deals been done 33  of what you re comparing Solana to apple and microsoft I love this guy  ️ JAN 04  2021  Treasury s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency told national banks that they are allowed to run independent nodes for distributed ledger networks  Banks will be hosting Solana nodes and validating Tell that to apple  microsoft  etc    It s like someone gave these stocks meth If Moore s law actually fails we should be building bunkers  SIMD gpu avx capacity  ssd size  pci  network bandwidth has been doubling every two years like clockwork   The latest nvidia GPUs have 10k    lanes It s not expensive for anyone that s into PC building or has been running eth mining rigs at home with 12 GPUs Solana has no penalties for stake concentration   So a single entity would save a bunch of money by running 1 node with a ton of stake   On Mainnet right now you need 12 nodes to get to 33   eth2 is 4 entities what is the time span  assuming solana stays at the same price  of becoming profitable running a solana node You can mint NFT s all the time but you would need a marketplace dapp that is available on the same blockchain for you to be able to sell it  If you need you can go mint some mean  green NFTs on Solana right now  https   spl solana com token MY BROTHA   I too make digital art but It is more of a hobby  I also happen to code better than I can draw  It is easier for me to help artists than become one Coming to the point  There are several closed marketplaces for NFT S which I could tell you about  But as an amateur programmer I think it best not to rush people into minting NFT on Solana which doesn t have a good marketplace yet  As much as I d like to help you mint a non fungible token immediately   which I can by the way  Without a good place to sell it it d be a sitting duck  Not for long BROTHA Honestly this is like pathetic  Crypto is a one way street  Understand what each coin brings to the real world and how it is integrated with the block  People are so dollar blind rather than value woke  Do someresearch and make a sound decision based on your support for the service it provides to users  Risk can t be evaluated on Reddit Ty Pretty sure that will automatically be returned to you eventually at current prices which is like a 12x run up   Bull runs dont last forever At current prices  70 000 SOL stake is profitable if you factor in  10 000 in costs to run a validator per year   That s enough stake to run over 4 000 validators if stake was spread evenly The more evenly stake gets spread  the more validators will join   1 000 is easily possible with the current spread ratios Even if there were 10 000 unique validators you d always be able to move the goalposts and ask  but how many of  those  are run by the same person Google for unmetered servers  You can find server for  100 150 per month to run a node right now the server specs they gave are for future   not today Solana s definition of Moore s Law is more broad than the usual definition and includes other hardware advances  With these included  it continues to work  at least according to the Solana team  maybe u aeyakovenko could give some examples Sorry about your loss or should i call your bad luck but Anatoly  amp  the Solana team don t have the 24 7 to check on Reddit  Discord is crowded enough for them lol  so won t blame them  i m already there  amp  i know how it looks like Good luck  but donation or asking for it is forbidden in this Solana Subreddit It s vaporware right now  Look them up and go to their website  They have to show a working product before mega pump Solana is not ignoring decentralization  Are there more decentralised networks out there  Maybe  There s always tradeoffs in building software Regarding the requirements  if you look up the prices of those components  you get to    8000  1 processor  4ssds  128gb ram  but let s say it was  10 000  That is   54 000 cheaper than running an eth2 node requires 32eth    64K   Sure there are staking pools on eth2 but solana can and likely will have them too The question is whether people want to become a validator on a network like Solana which has   6 times  cheaper validator requirements  and more scalability without sharding  than eth2 with but not as much name recognition  Time will tell us the answer My sol address Aj2ZVuCrRg7Etq8a6PrTnshDfHFpVVb8btK5JPpBjtbW Thks  for the support  I was hoping anatoly would see this and stforep in  But he made too much money already  he has no time for us lesser people  I just needed support to help me out  I m only missing 15 sol   Why should he bothered for that I m gonna rant  since things don t go my way Only a year ago I was working in nevada and I had a 1000 sol  Bought it at 50 cents  Had 500 million in kin also  Total investment around 5000 dollars in February of 2020  Working as a bartender I was so excited for the future  Then covid happened  Wasn t able to work for 8 months  Sold all my crypto to make amends  and never got a new job  So moved back home  Moved in with dad and started over  A 40 years man moved back home  and all of a sudden kin and sol take off  Its almost like God was waiting for me to sell it to give me a big fuck you   I ll tell you what  Ever since I moved back I got to spend more time with my dad  so that s a plus Based off short term fluctuations   yes    based on marketcap  EARLY Good work So there is erc 20 USDT and SPL USDT  Binance does not support SPL USDT  You could send the erc 20 USDT to Metamask wallet and use the sollet io wallet to convert it into SPL USDT but this will incur high gas fees  I recommend selling the USDT for Solana  Withdrawal the Solana to your Sollet wallet  Connect to project serum dex  and sell the Solana for USDT  The USDT you receive will be SPL USDT  You will incur a Solana fee for creating a new wallet and processing transactions on the serum dex Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet  Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened  vision cleared  ambition inspired  and success achieved      Helen Keller   Commands   opt out Btw what about sending USDT to my SOL wallet from Binance In Binance it complain about the address is not valid  it say this   The withdrawal address format is wrong  Please check the withdrawal address length and character content and try again and also what transfer network I should use  It deosnt have SOL network for some reason Oooh  thx you alot sir Ps this community so far have less toxic people haha you are very welcome   lt 3 They will be locked in the internet bit world but you can unstake them whenever  They will be locked up for a max of 60 seconds  You will see the pending reward update each minute  I recommend reinvesting the staked rewards for them maximum gains Ok  but hey   thx you alot for this information i m sorry   i have no info about staking since i never really tried it Yeah that what I thought    What happen to the RAYs if I decide to stake them  Lets say I stake 100 Ray s  Is it Locked somewhere in internet bit world or is it still avaible on my SOL wallet  Like I can unstake them pretty much anytime I want The exchange was the least safe space to keep them because you do not own the keys  The Sol wallet is safe for now  Make sure you have your seed phrase backed up and don t share it with anybody  The ledger will be the most safe place to keep your coins once you receive it  If you prefer a mobile wallet I recommend coin98 or moonlet where you can stake your Sol Yeah I was thinking about long term you know  What about staking on Raydium  have you try that  and whats your APR    How does it even work  like you just connect your wallet to raydium website and stake it  Does the tokens ever leave your wallet or does it still stay there i used  sollet io  https   sollet io  i think its pretty cool and safe just keep your seed words safe in a paper But its safe to store it in there for little longer right  Bc I was thinking about to order Ledger or get a hot wallet that can support SOL tokens  I mean SOL wallet is cool  nothing againts it just wondering about safety since its  browser wallet Just a small bug  I have a few other tokens that don t show a balance on the wallet but it doesn t affect anything  It should be updated soon Bro what wallet do you use to swap in there  Im currenly using SOL wallet and I wonder is it safe to store RAYs in there  Bc my Trezor deosnt support it    also Exodus doesnt support it lol I reckon the problem is offering technical support for the SPL token  Like you can buy SOL on crypto com but you can t transfer it out because they don t support it yet  I guess it takes quite a lot to support so many different chains indeed the fee is 0 02 i guess Also EXODUS doesnt support SOL tokens  P CEX are smart enough to know that they need to provide the most important tokens or you will move your money where you can buy them  I have account in 6 different platforms because I needed it to get a particular token I wanted  Coinbase has taken many years in listing ADA so Solana could take weeks    Or 2 years  Who knows     I expect it sooner than later but  as far as I know  we don t have any official communication excited to see where everything goes  Solana is the future great job Is this how we re gonna be able to buy SOS when it s launched  hopefully this week No Is this somehow related to stock ticker symbol  SOS Limited we must stack solana to have access to the pool Nothing is impossible to link this X Chain to That Y chain  it s a matter of time  amp  up to developers willing to do it when they have the right packages  amp  resources The future is definitely for bridges  cross chains  amp  interoperability that will link most of the blockchains to each other As for now  there is nothing about  interoperability between Solana  amp  PolkaDot  but who knows what will happens next They will be eventually  Check out what Andre Cronje is doing with multichain xyz  They re using Fusion DCRM which theoretically supports any EVM compatible chain  Right now it s limited to ETH  FTM  BSC  FSN  HUOBI  and SOL  testnet   but I m pretty sure Moonbeam s parachain will be supported  The RPC has already been added to https   chainlist org Did it ever show up  Im having the same issue right now  it s been over 24 hours now I don t think it is at all   So zero prob I am having the same issue at some point it ll fail  that s inevitable  you can t double the number of transistors every 2 years forever I was comparing a bull run to a bull run  There are many assets that have ran and just never came down
2021-04-06,22.97784134,25.34652466,21.87661417,Bought mine on raydium as well Hi u stephpsqn  I work as a python web dev and also wanted to learn solana   Do you have useful resources to jumpstart learning or just refer directly from the  Solana docs  https   solana com developers Hey guys  anyone that is a developer better head to Solana Discord  you can find all what you need there   https   discord com invite pquxPsq  https   discord com invite pquxPsq Fully agree Sounds correct  Just kinda dumb when I reject it doesn t revert my funds back because solana already sent it to some escrow account supposedly like you said Given that LUA is an ERC20 token it s not that you re sending it to some other address  unless you re interacting with a smart contract   but to the LUA address linked to your ETH metamask address which should be functionally the same  however  unless you add the token to your token list  sometimes you can t see that you ve received it   All that said  when converting between any wrapped currency and back to the native form of the currency  I think  and don t quote me on this   that there s some sort of escrow minting service happening in the background  So  essentially  the real thing goes into a vault  and you re supposed to receive a wrapped version that holds the real one s value   I think your state of limbo might have been caused by paying the Solana fee to send  but then failing to pay the eth gas fee  which you should still be able to do if your stuff was sent to a smart contract   But  I m no expert on this stuff   For clarification  did you end up getting your Lua  I couldn t tell from your reply Thanks all for the replies  I wish I heard about it in Jan  when I could have easily bought a ton of it  or at least took action in mid to late Feb   But there s no use in crying over spilled milk  So  I decided to bite the bullet and bought a few at the current price  Better late than never I guess  Hopefully  It doubles by EOY I bought at the ath at the moment of 5 2  first time buying high  but I was blown away by the tech and the Team  Also  not much hype atleast from my perspective on other channels  I think Solana is lowkey censored in crypto currency Having the same issue Solana  is on Trending Search on coingecko people get fomo I just bought more No liquidity on raydium trading matket  I just sold some last night as safe there blockchain I would assume   I use it only for coins I want to actively trade   similar how I would treat an exchange wallet I had this too a few times when sending  SOL and staking on Raydium  The solution for me was  you can t use MAX on  SOL  Because you need a small balance left on the wallet to make the transaction  Makes sense  but still a pain gt 2cyycuGWiJJosV75K7nAW5PdTCtwLimcL51v4GMVFAXBNPpnRskhrNWAXTAboBdrwc2ufiNy63PjGiZFffJxE8x2I did via serum  but when I click settle I get   Error settling fundsLedger device  UNKNOWN _ERROR  0x6808 Thanks a lot  I thought I wasn t getting any rewards but after running your command I realized they were just very small Cool  DM me your github etc I am software developer currently learning solana  would be happy to take part in a blockchain related project If you swapped it via serum  make sure to click settle funds on the bottom right Where is a safer play to store my SOL  Blockfolio or sollet Yes I thought I missed the bus when it was at USD 6 13   but I still bought at that price and I ve been pretty happy about the decision   Edit  Also  the ecosystem is still growing wildly  so I m definitely expecting upward price movement over the next few months years This party is just getting started my friend  I expect Solana will be a top 10 coin by market cap by the end of summer  The whole ecosystem is incredibly strong and still very early in adoption and maturity but is also best in class  This is just my opinion and is not financial advice Can I take part in anything on solana in the US  Seems to be a problem that I can t use anything solana related Never too late  Join the Solana community  take part  learn and be part of the journey AFAIK KIN community is waiting for the official KIN Swap Tool to swap their ERC20 KIN to KIN SPl   Sources       https   kin org token migration  https   kin org token migration      https   t me TheKinChannel 163482  https   t me TheKinChannel 163482 just wondering  since sollet is web based  is it safe This wormhole works on sollet but it incurs pretty high gas fees from erc 20 to spl  I believe they are working on an update to reduce the fees Hey mate this is an answer from   jon  Rye 1687    from Solana team member in Solana Discrod    It depends on what they want exactly       solana block  lt SLOT gt can give block info from a desired slot  and    solana block production  lt EPOCH gt can give general info about who produced blocks over an epoch     solana epoch infocan t go backwards in time unfortunately     To have quick response for technical questions like that  better head to Solana Discord That s the confusing part  When you scroll down on https   solana com wormhole it says the wormhole is live When will Wormhole be live After undergoing an in depth security audit by the smart contract and cryptography experts at Kudelski  we re happy to announce that Wormhole is now live  starting with support for ETH This is just the beginning  in the coming weeks we ll be looking to add support for Terra as well  upgrading Wormhole to a 3 way cross chain bridge Once wormhole is live  that will work for KIN What specifically are you looking for       solana blockwill give you info about the current block In that you can find the parent slot  and you can then use      solana block  lt PARENT_SLOT gt to get info on the previous block   In this way you could look through the history of blocks one by one I m not sure what you mean by  inspect previous epochs    An epoch is just a collection of slots  there are 432 000 slots in an epoch   and the commands mentioned will let you look at any previous slot  so you can look at  previous epochs  that way Finally  in terms of fees  the fees haven t changed in a long time if ever  so I don t think looking at historical data would be very interesting Have you actually run the solana command and read its help about the different sub commands available  and played with them   If not  do so  it will tell you everything you can find out from the command line So i work in a branch of physics called  spintronics  and there is a lot promising science tech in this which hopes to replace the transistor within RAM memories  Moore s law is only about transistors  but i think when it plateaus a new technology will come to replace it  I m pretty confident that these spintronics based memories will be better then the silicon counterpart in everyway  or at least thats the feeling i get working in this field Hi Anatoly  nice of you to drop by The fact that Solana only proves relative time is no problem for the application I envision  Let us say we have the following configuration 1  Both the device that will be challenged  and the challenging hardware are controlled by the attacker2  the attacker also controls the local Solana node that is physically close to the device to be challenged  The fact it is part of the Solana network and cannot let bad behavior be detected limits its options  but it still has options 3  the challenge hardware takes PoH Hash N as input into its challenge query data  and stores the response from the device as a user generated hash in PoH hash N 1 I was wondering whether an upper bound on time could be observed and validated by the Solana ledger  In my example above  I am looking for a way for the remote validators to put a cap on Delta T _max  in  this schematic  https   imgur com a NtRr62e   The dashed vertical lines are  synchronization  lines  I did not read the white paper in detail yet  so I am just postulating there is such a mechanism   the small red lines are individual PoH hashes  nodes 1 and 2 are  honest  nodes  and node 3 runs faster first  to get ahead a little  then gives extra time to the device to compute a counterfeit response to the challenge  and resumes fast hashing to meet the next synchronization deadline I am looking for a way where the challenge response validators would only accept the response to the challenge if some conditions  allowing to cap Delta T Max  are met  In other words  how could the local Solana node reliably prove to the network that the challenge response was made with a Delta T _max of less than  say  1 µs The point is to give strong assurance to the network that the external device did not have enough time to forge a counterfeit response before the challenge data became obsolete  and therefore  that it had to use the honest way to answer  as it would be the only way to submit an answer in time Thanks again for your help This is a race between Ethereum  Polkadot  Cardano  Solana  Terra  Harmony  Holochain      and I think the race has just started Bitcoin is digital gold  and gold is nice and shiny  But smartchains  blockchains with smart contracts  are what will power the next internet Just about any successful web application  FaceBook  Uber  AirBnB       can be ported to smart chains to change the balance of power between users and GAFAMs All these smart chains are in some sort of technical   hype war  but I feel in the end that the most scarce and important ressource that they are all fighting for is developers Ethereum for example  is currently the slowest and more expensive blockchain to use  But it s still first because it has most of the applications The party is just starting Not even top 10 yet  this network has absolutely 0 mainstream exposure  I expect it and Cosmos ATOM to be top ten projects before the end of 2021 can we flag to this for r solana moderator I believe Coinbase has to include SOL  but just my personal opinion its like a lot of major blockchains where the big validators are enterprise level   look at thetas design  the enterprise validators require 1m theta to stake and a super computer that you can setup using google cloud they also have a  you and me  validator called guardians which only need 1000 theta and can run on any pc or laptop so i think sol is only working with enterprise level validators at moment    perhaps it would be nice for sol to develop user validators as well    i dunno   but i wouldnt say this is unusual setup Think it could 10x or more this bull run from here  Honestly having serum and capability to scale to web3 is such a big deal  The only dex with a clob  Not impossible to 100x from here over the next few years if the ultra bull case come true  Of course none of this could happen as well Realistically I m expecting a push close to  50 in the near termAgain though  what do I know Solana is a great project I m sure it s only a matter of time before it gets listed on major exchanges that exactly the issue i v run into   currently submitting on some alternate platforms but most are only running at 1000 tps or worse and have pretty minimal traffic  ce la vie Buy SOL wherever you can onboard fiat the easiest  but transfer your SOL to your own wallet  You can find SOL supported wallets through Solana com  Make sure to write your seed phrase down and never take a picture of it or store it on your computer  NEVER lose your seed phrase SOS will likely be available on the Serum DEX first Fuck no  Rust is the most loved programming language outside of cryptocurrencies  Rust is the native language of SOL  Do you want the real world utilizing the cryptocurrency you own  Yes  HFSR It can t really create absolute time  only relative  So you could force a device to wait until a specific slot  Or check back history that devices did an action sometime in the past Sub 1us would be tough unless you just run your own poh locally for a dedicated usecase Was also wondering this  Hoping not before I ve bought a few hundred more SOL as the price will pump when the coin is more accessible The bus only just started rolling mate  6bn market cap is like ethereum being  50   buy and hold and enjoy your 10x return in three years Happy to help  Any chance we can get flare on this subreddit im having this issue today Thank you u ogjenkins for helping the new guy getting into the SolFam u benyzland Don t hesitate to ask whatever you have in mind about SOL  we ll help you out  Glad to have you here with us in this crypto journey Why would you think that you have missed the bus  We re still super early both when it comes to crypto in general and Solana specifically  It makes sense to me to compare Solana to chains like Polkadot and Cardano which have 3 4 times the marketcap so there s plenty of room to grow even in terms of catching up to them  And even more if you think Solana can some day get to Ethereums level
2021-04-07,25.14556002,27.48761542,23.08935918,Imo this now a race for third place after Ethereum and BSC with Polkadot in the lead Ok mate  can you head to SolFlare Telegram for faster support  i

SolFlare_Wallet Same for me  I can t restore my wallet with 24 seed phrases I mean I can trade it back for sol  but also that I can t settle to my wallet  even though there is enough sol left Yes about 30 sol left in my wallet  so that must be enough I would say Are you sure you left some SOL  let s say 0 1 SOL  into your SolFlare account as GAS On advice to put in my mind when dealing with crypto wallets  don t deposit in it unless you double check that the Seed Phrase  amp  password you kept safe somewhere is working when your try to restore it  that s what i do I Always save the Seed Phrase somewhere safe  test the wallet by restoring it  if everything is perfect  then i start using it You said    I tried to restore existing wallet by   putting in my 24 seed words but it won t let me press next    I m completely lost   Double check the Seed Word  the         Greyed UnClickable Next Button     means there is an Error in that seed word Check this example i just made for you to

buy up a ton of the stake and unilaterally control that share of block production I used ledger with moonlet and then for some reason switched to solflare    but my moonlet still showed my account balance   then it hit me    it s all on the ledger  Learning experience for sure Ledger is safe to use from any GUI as long as you verify the txs you sign on the trusted display I have to do that through solflare correct  How safe is the sollet wallet VDFs are good at showing the min amount of time something took but not the max Ledger There will be apps that most average hodlers never touch because they are advanced financial instruments  But I mean there is gonna be a protocol where you can just lend your savings for interest or borrow against your sol for a collateralized loan  Honestly I think they are gonna make it much more user friendly in the future and it s worth sticking around  Plus the coin is just still undervalued I am no Sollet wallet expert  In my own experience with it there was occasionally a delay with updates on price and withdraw   receiving  I found firefox to have a lot fewer issues with it   I dont know why firefox seemed to play nice with it on my

discord com invite pquxPsq    https   discord com invite pquxPsq I hope we see you there  good luck Star Atlas already mentioned in previous posts  thanks for the reminder  This list is like for the latest Solana Dapps Hard to cover all the Solana Dapps the way you want to  the Solana Ecosystem is getting wild which is so amazing  The guide should be done by the Dapp itself  Raydium  Oxygen  Serum      which AFAIK already doing it through their documentations The UI is the biggest dilemma in this whole cryptosphere not just in the Solana Dapps  we re like in the embryo stage lol when it comes to UI in crypto Dexes Nothing like that yet AFAIK  it would be great to see someone doing it  it will be the first of its kind in Solana Ecosystem Thing about L2 is that different L2s aren t interoperable  So some dapp on L2 solution x can t communicate with dapp on L2 solution y  Whereas on sol the throughput allows scaling for all dapps to live and communicate on L1 Star Atlas 27 26 you call that a dip  SOL is one of the best coin holding up right now  Take a look at filecoin or bnb  It s an absolute wipeout zone out there Agree with that  crypto community needs a fair distribution system during IDOs I also hope that SolStarter will solve problem that as they promise Projects have chosen solana   many more will pick ETH L2  amp  eventually ETH2   many will still pick Solana  The fact that Sam Bankman fried chose solana for serum is good enough a reason that solana has a lot of good projects coming on board  Check out solana podcast   star atlas project looks v interesting Your     Question    The unlock schedule would seem to indicate there should be a larger circulating supply than CMC indicates    Answer      The Total Supply in CMC seems the same as in  solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io     492 620 242 SOL       The Circulation Supply in CMC     268 416 587 SOL   almost the same as in  solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io      268 416 510 SOL    too  just the 3 digits has some minor difference     Your Question    Does anyone know if there s been any updates to the following transparency report     Answer      The latest update about the Transparency Report can be found in here   https   solana com tokens  https   solana com tokens    To check the Total Supply  this is the best place to know about it   https   solanabeach io supply  https   solanabeach io supply     Your Question    Are there any plans to have a Solana wallet     Answer    Development is going on  amp  the Solana developers from everywhere are doing an amazing job    Fantomwallet   is around the corner    lots of other Wallets that support Solana are out there already    so everything seems to be going as supposed to be  just a matter of time  amp  patience is required from this amazing  amp  supporting Solana community I dunno if you ve used or are using Raydium  but if you aren t  you should  I agree that the standard Serum dex is kinda clunky  but Raydium is a much better UI and a pleasure to use Checkout solanabeach io  it s great for researching validators Ahh okay  I might switch to a different delegate and see if I earn Thanks for the list I just hope Solstarter is gonna have a better whitelisting process than Polkastarter so we actually have a chance without being an influencer I really like how LPOOL is doing it right now   allocating based on staking so we all have a chance New Projects building on Solana  Source From     S L mates     https   twitter com Solana_Mates  Twitter Account   https   twitter com Solana _Mates status

cashtag_click This is came straight from  https   messari io asset solana  https   messari io asset solana    Solana Labs began raising funds to build its new crypto network in Q2 2018  Between Apr  2018 and Jul  2019  the team raised a little over  20 million in various private token sales  They    announced    https   medium com solana labs solana completes 20 million raise led by multicoin capital 3d7f939475b6  the sales as a single Series A in late July 2019  The fundraising effort ran parallel to Solana s work on the protocol  which went through several permissioned testnet phases before the team announced its public incentivized testnet  called Tour de SOL  in Q3 2020  The first stage of Tour de SOL went live in Feb  2020  and it continues to run alongside the Mainnet Beta version of Solana today  I think you re thinking about Solana the wrong way  It s an ecosystem  open to everyone to build on  If it were up to the founders and their team to build out the entire ecosystem  wallets and all  it would take decades before we saw real progress I was just checking that the fees weren t 100   you can choose a validator with 0  fees  I guess the next question is  is the validator you choose delinquent  Perhaps they haven t been online Community nodes  This is why I m not down with EOS personally  21 nodes is absolutely nothing in the POS world  Another one of my favorite projects Elrond  eGLD  just added more community nodes and are up to 3200 I delegated to a validator  but there were no fees  do I need to delegate to a validator with fees You still need to pay crazy gas to enter and leave the L2 is ther Solana academy and guide how use all SOL ecosystem   i wish that we have some more easy UI DEX and DEFI but this project is awasome you should specify what L2 you mean  Loopring is there since long ago and EVM compatible attempts are in testing phases  not delivered for real   An LR is miniscule This is some quality posting Once it was in a stake account  did you delegate to a validator  If so  did you check the delegators fees I looked into SOL at  1 45  bought 100 Sold at  5  lolWill still probably get in at current price IF IT EVER DIPS Literally goes up when the market goes down I m using moonlet currently I haven t had this problem  but I ve been using bonfida to connect to serum Dex  Settles no problem through bonfida same here  has anyone had luck yet  I ve written support for over 13 hours now Can t find my kin wallet  What is going on I had the same issue last night so I m glad to see it s being addressed Kin wallet and

fhmfendgdocmcbmfikdcogofphimnkno hl en It does have a desktop app  vis chrome extensions  Once you sign in once it should stay open  just make sure you  settle  any transactions if you are trading on a dex Don t expect a massive use form the first day    why should be different There are no widely used L2 solutions  They come in July We had several L2 solutions in ETH and BTC  And high gas is still there  If you want to have dozen of millions of users  you need also many transactions to enter and leave the L2  Layer 2 is like adding new lanes for a highway  They don t solve the traffic although it can help because they induce more cars using it When you are creating your staking account  are you creating it with all the solana you have   I think it needs a reserve of solana  so try creating it with most of your money but leave out 1 or 2 solana  I assume this is used for txs  etc When you are creating your staking account  are you creating it with all the solana you have   I think it needs a reserve of solana  so try creating it with most of your money but leave out 1 or 2 solana  I assume this is used for txs  etc Spam account  Do not use referral What part of the blockchain  blockchain state  history or block size  I m assuming history  The archivers take care of that AFAIK Solana isn t just a blockclain    It s gearing up for the IoT and web3 Awesome news    ️ ️ That s not true  The amount to L1 transactions will be significantly reduced with the use of L2 solutions  This will lead to a drastic decrease in fees with L1 solutions still on the way Thank you  This kind of information should be on front page of the Solana website Thanks  I asked in their telegram and sol is not part of what they accept as collateral  unfortunately  I want to borrow against sol and use stables to buy into a raydium pool Oxygen is an interesting defi prime brokerage in the works  but it isn t out yet oxygen org Is there a place on Solana to deposit Sol as collateral and borrow stables  I have not found any You are presuming someone would gamble 10 million dollars on the hopes that it would have their intended effect   That is a big risk to take Look at the volume  D And what about avalanche that allows to create L1 which can also operate as a L2 interoperable with others avalanche L2s  How to compare with Solana Just filled my bags  Going to get more soon  Just hoping it stays under  40 for the next month or two lol Bought Solana at  1 30 due to personal interest and fundamentals around its time stamp based consensus protocol  Been following the price trying to plot some trends recently and had difficulty due to the fact it s relatively new and there s very little selling pressure at the moment  As of now this is the only pattern I see which I call a  parabolic ascending triangle  lol That would be oxygen but it s not out yet  although as noted above use raydium and get some nice staking rewards This is what I mean  The total market cap of the project is 7 billion dollars  even if the cost to spam for one day is like 10 million dollars  it would still be enormously cheap for an attacker to lower the whole Solana value I am however aware that I may miss something  that s why I am here asking The point of doubling the Fees in such scenario is to make it cost tons of money  so like you said unless someone willing to burn his thousands of dollars  may be couple millions  lol  on this  good luck to him with that What s the  capacity  and how is it calculated The minimum transaction fee right now is 0 00005 SOL   One hundred thousand transactions per second would thus cost  5 SOL per second  which at current prices is about  13 per second   This is  780 per minute   It would be expensive to attempt this attack  but certainly within the realm of feasability for someone who is rich and wants to do damage  but only for a fixed amount of time   No one has infinite money and would be able to infinitely spam the network   Three days of this spamming would cost over a million dollars Raydium in liquidity pools and farms Thanks for your reply Mr  Yakovenko Cool  I want to ask you about blockchain s space cost  With Bitcoin  in order to occupy space on the blockchain  store transactions   you have to pay a high fee because you only have 1MB every 10 minutes  or a little more if everyone used Segwit  of space available Here I am NOT talking about  deep  decentralization arguments like  blockchain has to remain small in order for everyone to download it  because as long as there are even few thousands of nodes distributed around the globe that can operate I can t see any real threat I am talking about the possibility of an eventual attacker to  relatively cheaply  occupy disk space on nodes And maybe I didn t get how Solana works at all  but even 50k of legit transactions per second looks a lot to be stored  How much is the average transaction size   I can t find this info  along with the actual blockchain size too  Thanks You can do so as part of a liquidity pool pairing on raydium and a few other dexs  Unfortunately half of your USDC will be converted to the paired coin token  Right now there is no protocol for simple stablecoin lending as far as I know   amp  x200B But they are in development Wait   this does not tell me all coin in Solana ecosystem  Only coins on FTX exchange Thank you you are Genius Alternative way is to buy on dex first Do fees increase 2 n as the capacity keeps halving what are the UNDERVALUED  NEW  projects on the solana ecosystem If you   for example  swap sol in ray   you have to add ray in the wallet with the  add token  function  before you can swap them I know i dont say That whales cant do it i was Just wondering if Thats a fake support Smashing it again today  Good work Nessy Same issue  Any fix  Enabling blind signing and leaving enough SOL in the wallet does not fix it Damn  than i doubled my investment  23   14 8 We going to  30 by the weekend If the remaining capacity drops by half fees double  This will cause spam to back off Hate to be the guy but   we are going to the moon When does Solaris come out It look fake because if they remove the price will skyrocket Could be there as price suppression  Whales have lots of advanced techniques usually illegal in normal markets  Either way if you like the stonk  buy it https   solflare com

the staking tab on SolFlare and click  create account   it won t let the ledger sign the transaction  Just nothing pops up on the ledger and then I get the error message on my desktop screen  Anyone discover a workaround for that You can receive rewards for staking your SOL to a Validator  Do some research on choosing Validators and check out Solfare   Ledger for the actual staking process Buy a

mediocre tech at price point 27 200 there million whale try to jump into the pool last night the amount of student coin spam is too damn high I think I ve applied to like 6 whitelists at POLS and its near impossible to ever get selected   such is the great level of demand  Of course there are other models  but they each come with their trade offs    BSCPad has months long vesting schedule and the fair allocation means you only really ever get laughable amounts allocated to you    CFI just launched  but you need to ensure you re staked  and at a large amount  to access  the best deals in size  This exposes you to token price dumping  which it has done for the last couple of weeks    Kickpad is also new and had a timed event which was instantly sold out in less than 1 second   not sure what you make of that but perhaps bots    TRUSTSWAP is one thats been more established and has guaranteed allocations   FCFS Flash launches   so they have the best of both worlds  However  they also favour long term stakers which exposes you to token price risk and there have been people who have staked long and in large amounts so you will always be disadvantaged Would you kindly look at mine for me  I sent 267 SOL from Binance USA to Gate io 8 days ago and I am getting  we will get back to you as soon as possible  from both sides  On March 30   07 06 16 EST I withdrew 267 493095 SOL to the following Gate io address  3juo2sWaRFNcHVSCMoAL7wAz5Cf6N1w4L4hnfUc7fce9  Any help would be greatly appreciated some whale establishes massive sell wall to accumulate cheap tokens from plebs  People

cashtag_click    SRM  https   twitter com search q  24SRM amp src cashtag_click From where I sit it seems like it s designed to replace networks like Ethereum  but it s also more than capable of existing alongside them in a support role as well  I don t think Ethereum will ever go away  but Solana can basically do everything Ethereum is currently doing  only far  far better and cheaper  It s just a matter of will people want to migrate to a new network  and if the answer is no  at least for some things   I think a lot of those folks will still find a network like Solana useful to offset the ridiculous gas fees associated with doing business on Ethereum Thanks  I ll check it out You might look into ftx us   I did a test transaction where I sent 1 SOL directly to my account on ftx us and was able to convert that to USDC and then withdraw to fiat   I assume that I could have sent USDC SPL but I can t say for sure since I didn t do it that way Their web site is a little unclear on USDC SPL  it says explicitly that you can withdraw USDT as SPL  but doesn t say anything about USDC SPL  but I don t really see why they would support USDT SPL and not USDC SPL  might just be an ommission in their docs Anyway  I recommend researching your options at ftx us gt 	no  t yet It doesn t surprise me  I transferred all my Sol to my Blockfolio anyway Adjust it   That is so strange   You shouldn t have to adjust your fees   They are calculated  not something you set yourself   It sounds like moonlet io may be skimming off the top by pretending that users have to set fees  setting them by default to much higher than they should be  and pocketing whatever amount users are overpaying on transaction fees   Kinda lame Any word on when they ll work with Trezor Most of that must have been paying binance us   Actual Solana transaction fees on a single transfer would be much less than one penny The only wrinkle is that the Solana transaction fee is per signature  most transfers only need one signature since they are a transfer from just one account   But I guess if for some reason you had your Solana split up into several thousand individual accounts and you performed one transaction that moved them all at the same time  you could end up with a 57 cent transaction fee I think it s much more likely that binance us is charging you high transaction fees though   Sounds like they are charging fees about 3 000 times higher than base Solana fees Of course it s speculation  You seem lost   Don t you know where you are  This is all speculation did you find a fix yet  have the same problem Solana is an L1 smart contract platform which uses a technology called proof of history on top of its consensus mechanism  proof of stake  to radically speed up block times and therefore transactions This sounds like speculation to me  If the demand for solana is high enough  I see no reason why they wouldn t list it  They are a business  FTX token on the other hand I would understand your argument Sol just briefly moved up one spot into top 20 in market cap Binance US is where I sent it from  I wonder if that s why What wallet were you sending from  I wonder if they default to a higher standard fee  in Moonlet the default is  01 SOL and I need to adjust it every time  even though the actual average SOL tx fee is  00005 SOL or like 0 0015 cents Holding  I put more into Solana a few days ago  It s about 8  of my portfolio now curious about this too are you planning to hold or sell  genuinely curious Maybe more congestion  As someone who held ETH for a while  I think that s a huge win for me  But idk    but yeah it cost me about  57 that   still seems too high Updated the app and now we re good Coinbase won t play ball with solana since SBF is involved  and SBF is a competitor to coinbase  Same reason you won t see BNB on coinbase Actually I lied  That was for another asset  It cost be  57 lol 3  That s high Last time I transferred sol it cost me less than a penny  a month ago   Have fees risen that much Sol is not listed on coinbase currently Thank you so much   this is extremely helpful  It s definitely tough for a new entrant    even with  free  hardware and network  what I didn t realize was that you are losing significant money just on voting costs until you can find 11 000 SOL worth of stake at a 10  commission  So I will probably turn my validator off until some sort of pool becomes available  including Stake Boss   Appreciate all the work you re putting into this sub Nice  I got in at like  6 but I only put  250 in  But that turned into like  1100  Some nice gains Moonlet and Sollet io Yeah I m really glad I found it around  10   The low fees and the speed are really promising What s its role in the future   Is it designed to support or replace   If so what No doubt  I feel the same way Solana   is a   layer 1      Proof of Stake    PoS      fast      secure    and   censorship resistant   blockchain where you can make transactions as cheap as  10 for 1 million   transactions Who knows  What we do know it Solana has exploded in a short amount of time  The network seems like it s capable of scaling and handling large quantities of transactions I m actually really impressed with how low gas fees are  Sent like 50 Sol to another wallet and it cost me like 3 You can t transfer Sol from Uphold  Coinbase doesn t support it  Blockfolio does though and so does Binance US  But to get it out  you ll have to cash it out or convert to a stable coin or another crypto and send it to another wallet  I d recommend just cashing out Hey mate  good read  amp  good catch To know more about Pyth you can check their official links below     Website     https   pyth network  https   pyth network      Telegram     https   t

question  should be able to send it with just an address but I ve never used uphold  What is the field called Whats exodus Does not work with Crypto com yet What is the official websites when is the token sale  Any idea what s the minimum investment how much per token It was  01 SOL to send from Moonlet  staking there never gave me any rewards how much would you pay in fees for withdrawing your sol to another wallet No problem  They re definitely swinging for the fences  but at the same time it doesn t feel too unrealistic and the people getting involved with the project in different ways gives me all the right vibes  Very excited for the future to see what can be accomplished Just saw that   Doesn t work yet for me  I only have the icon Thank you for sharing it with us  learned a lot from it   I m personally looking to delegate my SOL tokens and was doing research on in it what are the solutions for it and what is the risk of it  So stake boss popped up  Just wanted to share a solution By the way  I run a validator  and I always encourage people to spread their stake around   It s healthiest for the ecosystem There are efforts currently underway to create what are called  stake pools    These are going to be a network supported way to allow individuals to add their stake to a pool and in doing so acquire a token that earns stake according to how the stake pool distributes its tokens to validators   The stake pool tokens will  be tradeable and redeemable in their own right   It s sort of a second layer of staking  where you assign all of your stake to a pool and then the manager of the pool decides how to allocate all of that stake presumably for best return and security I have been told that this is expected to come online within a few months Another thing is what was mentioned by the previous poster    stake boss  is a thing soon to be released  from what I have read  by Block Logic  the company that does validators app   Stake Boss is not a true stake pool   there is no token created to represent membership  it s a much more direct mechanism where you simply re assign your staking authority to the Stake Boss managers who then choose how and when to stake your SOL presumably for best value and security   In this case you re basically just hiring a manager to manage your stake for you  that manager being Stake Boss   It s similar to what stake pools will be in practice Keep in mind that it s not possible for any of these services to exist without doing their own skimming off the top  if you find the concept of someone else managing your stake for you appealing  you may be fine with that   You re basically paying to have your stake managed  which is a perfectly valid service that you may find appealing Those two mechanisms are expected to help spread stake around because many stake pools  and possibly Stake Boss  although I don t know Block Logic s exact plans  only they know  will advertise that one of their features is that they help the network overall by spreading stake around   Presumably this means a wide spread but you never know  some may spread only a little bit  it will be up to how the pool is managed So when those come online  there is a chance that your validator could attract some of the SOL that those services manage If you are not in the USA  then you can also take advantage of the delegation that the Solana Foundation does from time to time to encourage new validators    it has a program run periodically that allows validators to apply to run on testnet in the  Tour de SOL  whereby they prove the quality of their systems  and once they pass all the hurdles  then get to move to mainnet and receive around 225 000 SOL staking from the Solana Foundation itself   More than half the validators currently running seem to have emerged from this program   However  this is only available to non US participants  and it also only happens occasionally  and furthermore  I have heard that the Foundation is trying to wind down this program in preference to just delegating a large amount of foundation SOL to stake pools and allow those to spread stake to small delegators to improve the total number of delegators I think that most validators with sizable stake amounts got it through  connections    The largest stake validators appear to have gotten most of their via industry insiders and financial institutions with large amounts of SOL   Those don t even seem to care that much about the quality of validation   the highest stake validator  Chorus One  was down for more than 9 hours last epoch  which is worse than any but the smallest and least professionally run validators   and yet Chorus One didn t lose any stake because of it  instead they seem to just be gaining more    So to some degree  stake begets more stake  which makes it even harder for those trying to enter   You are going to have to rely on connections  if you have them  and handouts from the foundation and stake pools  if and when those become available Once you have some stake and are in the system  you can then try to attract more  with lower commission  better service  better returns  additional services offered  and     marketing   Some validators are already starting to market themselves with phrases implanted in their validator name so that they show up on the validator lists   This could get pretty ugly as validators start trying to shout as loud as they can for attention   We ll see Thanks for explaining https   www validators app stake boss locale en amp network mainnet  https   www validators app stake boss locale en amp network mainnet  I think there is an initiative in making  Check it out I read and participate in the Solana discord  which is where I gather most of my info from   Sometimes you have read between the lines and do your own sleuthing   for example  it took me a while to figure out that slashing is not implemented   When I figure things out I try to share what I know with anyone who needs the info   I am somewhat new to crypto and am kind of surprised at how much misinformation is out there    to some degree I think that alot of projects  rely  on misinformation in order to gain people s attention   I think Solana s tech is very good and I don t think it needs to lean on misinformation so I try to clear up any confusion I can I looked at an Avalanche block explorer  I was seeing about one transaction every few seconds     what am I missing It should yes Definitely agree Now I understand  thanks https   twitter com aeyakovenko status 1353797289815404546 s 19quote Consensus TXs pay a fee  those state transitions are settled  the state updates are written to storage like everything else  The whole point of building a scalable blockchain is to make it cheap   Ours is cheap enough for n generals as well as every other use case on the planet I have yet personally to research this but the ceo responded to that without any counter argument received back Oh  there s plenty of overvalued shit in the market now   I won t disagree on that point   I don t think SOL is among them   I fully expect volatility  but it s nowhere near BTT  ADA  IOTA  or some other crazy overvaluation Yes i know  but still  Look at the volume    too much traders came into BTT  Marcet cap Is 250 milions And volume is huge  as everey another coin  I think and i hope that some corection coming Screenshot shows market depth  not volume   Maybe we re looking at something different Wtf dude Just 4 bilions USD 24h Correct  Avax CEO tweeted that if Avax were to calculate the same way solana calculated tps  Avax would equal 1 3m  Check emin gun sirer on Twitter Where can I stake Does it work with the ledger nano s From a scientific point of view you re right  I m sure there is a bunch of new tech which can  replace the modem transistor or a new design for it  However  from a manufacturing point of view mass production  this is probably a few decades away  The foundaries they currently use to make their chips are sooo expensive  i can t even imagine what would have to be the pool of money to make an industrial foundary to manufacture something on an atomic level  This would probably have to be sponsored by the entire global GDP or something  That s why i see this spintronics field having lots of potential  it offers significant improvement even with existing manufacturing technically Layer 2  sharding  etc   doesn t scale censorship resistance  just application TPS   The core of what we are doing with every performance optimization is scaling the min set of nodes that can censor the network   That set had to be super connected  And the only way to scale it is with hardware  because you need more signatures  more messages  more packets  Our goal is to be the worlds price discovery engine for everything   There is no way that will happen without censorship resistance I wonder where ur getting these numbers from  On their website it says Avax does 4 5 transactions per sec Wrong   avalanche does 1 3m transaction per second compared to solanas 90K  Avax is the best and more advanced tech in the crypto space Thanks for sharing  My man Anatoly had homie speechless lol  The kinda scale these guys are thinking on is just on a different level from pretty much any other project out there Wow  I didn t realize this is the current scenario  I ve been trying to dive deeper into Solana because I think I has great potential  Where are you finding this information if you don t mind sharing  Btw  I find your post

solanabeach io   to browse Validators with 10  or less fees and high uptime  The fee comes out of your earnings  not of your stake If a validator breaks voting rules  then they can be penalized  and it s called slashing   The idea is that the threat of slashing will keep validators honest Slashing would involve either a loss of SOL for the stakers of that validator  or a loss of rewards for the epoch  or both But    slashing is not implemented  it s only theoretical in Solana   It is a sizable gap in the ecosystem right now   I do not know what the Solana Foundations plans or roadmap are with respect to slashing What does slashed mean in this context check out step finance That s a killer keyboard by the way I had no idea your stake could be slashed  Surprised nobody is answering but I m really interested to hear more about this We run some stress test benchmarks and try to use that as the top number  It s hard to quantify since we want validators to use the cheapest hardware for the current load  but be able to move to best in class on demand Well provisioned nodes boot in 3 minutes from a snapshot   The ledger history is only useful for explorers  We have a project to commit

2021-04-14,27.4000051,27.48269178,24.79202053,Shouldn t it be considered like a savings account Let me tell you that we do not know  only they know  and they do not want to tell us until it is over It can be done with burning   you burn tokens on Ethereum and generate on Solana the same amount One solution without burning is to allow access to cvc on Solana with same ethereum private key  and then Ethereum cvc is locked but generated on Solana  and you can go back to Ethereum whenever you likeOther solution without burning is airdrop cvc tokens on Solana 1 1 based on Ethereum cvc holdings at some moment  and then lock all cvc tokens on EthereumThird way is my proposed way  like hard fork  with or without claiming Days or no cool off  Whatsoever if you are exchanging another crypto for Solana then you won t have any issues One last thing if you re looking to buy Solana regardless of the exchange make sure you look onto their lock up or cool down period  Some exchanges require you to hold your crypto anywhere from three days to a month or even more depending on how you made the purchase usually the lock up or cooldown  Is longer if you used your bank account however it varies from exchange to exchange from my experience using my debit card I had a cool down or cool off  Of a couple hours Apologies if this is a rookie question  but technically how will Civic transfer from one blockchain to another   How is that going to work   Currently CVC is an ERC 20 token running on the Ethereum blockchain   According to my limited understanding  that means all transactions of the CVC token are recorded on the ETH ledger  blockchain    When they move to SOL  does that mean they transfer all existing transactions over to the SOL blockchain   That would seem like a massive data migration   Or do they set a cutoff date after which all new transactions start getting recorded on SOL and prior to all historic transactions remain on ETH   And I assume the token count remains the same  would think it has to  when it transfers over   Does that mean they cancel all tokens on the Ethereum chain and regenerate them on Solana   I m not a blockchain developer  but I m very curious how technically a migration from one chain to another would work Ty king In the US you can buy Sol on Uphold  and Binance US 10 77  on Exodus 11 97  on Moonlet Hi  im new here and need some help plz  I have lots of kin in yobit   What do I need to do I don t know I just had a dusting attack on my trust wallet on my Tron and they still have an answered me back TrustWallet is safe enough  amp  well know Crypto Wallet If you face any problem with it always contact their official support Do you know what the APY for SOL is on exodus right now Not sure Is true  2018 was a rough year mentally How though  At month and half  you should have covered your original investment in usd by the apy that high  After 2 months you should be ahead even with impermanent lost Still new here to lping  isn t this how it works  Thanks If you did everything correct  amp  as supposed to be   then most probably it s User Interface  UI  problems  meaning if there is earning from your stake  they are sitting there  you just can see them  that s what s happening lately with SolFlare Head To SolFlare Telegram Support Group So They Gave You The Best Answer For that  https   t me SolFlare _Wallet  https   t me SolFlare_Wallet Blockfolio Do you know what the APY for SOL is on exodus right now Any news How much did you stake Unfortunately not sorry  not to my knowledge Get a VPN mate  Surfshark is like  60 for 2 years If the code is the same how is it theoretical raydium io  orca so for LPs  step finance to keep track of everything atm  Lots of other projects coming down the pipeline  lots of it gets posted on twitter Gather a good team to back you up if you don t have one right now   Head to Solana Discord   https   discord com invite pquxPsq  https   discord com invite pquxPsq   so you get more technical help  when you needed it    Explain your idea there  search for developers willing to be part of your project  if you like      Then build your app   project  amp  make the idea a reality Good luck Yeah but it s not Really great guide  You guys make it simple Everything seems pretty theoretical DOT has a lot going for it and equally amazing architecture that can have wide ranging implications even for Solana dApps  The future is 2nd layer solutions  amp  interoperability  The software tech is truly sick when you study it My thinking has always been  if you like what you read and you think it will go much higher from here   Then invest and accumulate  I m not a trader  so I m not looking to get in and out of short term positions  I invest in coins I think can skyrocket in value in 3 5 years
2021-04-15,26.43684327,28.24940016,25.53941458,all set  thanks Yes Ledger supports it  You can install the Solana app  then it ll create a wallet address on there  You can interact with it using the command line tools for Solana   https   docs solana com cli  https   docs solana com cli   Or on  sollet io  https   sollet io  if you create a web wallet there and go to  import hardware wallet  you can do stuff like add tokens and view balances I m in the same boat have printed copy of my seed words and the restore is greyed out You could try plugging in the address you sent them to on Solana explorer and see where the transaction went   https   explorer solana com   https   explorer solana com Oh  okay yea on Solana docs it says Mathwallet on iOS and Android doesn t support SOL or SPL tokens yet   https   docs solana com wallet guide web wallets  https   docs solana com wallet guide web wallets  If you search your wallet address on Solana Explorer you ll be able to see where the SOL went  I m not super familiar with Mathwallet  but maybe its just not visible on the mobile app Yeah I was thinking the same thing sorry  I was wrong I used mathwallet Thx alot of comments bro  I started To think about COPE for few days and decided not to stake It  I went back To stake More Ray USTD  It feels like with those high ass APR its just weird  Like it can be another alien world  TLM   So basially what happen Is that they drop 90  when they got listed on Binance because alot of People have farm Them and they decined To sell It out At same time Yes right now theyre listed on FXT but idk man  I think i might play It safe this time How did you get the SOL in your metamask wallet  I don t think metamask supports SOL The thing is that before January 2021 most tokens were not issued  Nothing weird  The project was not there We just got an update 2 days ago for wallet addresses  So next they have to add NFT support and staking support  Hopefully within a few months how far along are they  any rough eta  looks really good Brilliant thanks Yeah   the thought did cross my mind   I ll send all my funds to this address    Thanks really appreciate that I saw the minting thing   Just couldn t find the info I use sollet io wallet to hold COPE  You may have to mint the token in your wallet  you will need SOL for this   very little How to add  COPE to your sollet wallet Go to

wallet that you can send COPE to This information is in the official COPE discord which you can find  here  https   discord gg cope  if you don t want to trust a random stranger on Reddit Hi I was just wondering which wallet you can use to hold cope   I m wanting to use their pool and can t find this information anywhere   Cheers Great thanks Hey there  I already replied to you over on r ExodusWallet  but I ll respond over here for more visibility in case anyone else encounters this  You re right  your balance should reappear after 4 days  It s a quirk of our wallet not showing what s not spendable  We realize that the wallet doesn t communicate this well at all  We have a banner explaining this in the works  Sorry about that Yep same just happened to me XD I think being early is a big part of yield farming  because everyone is also buying the token to farm it so the price explodes as well yes pls help Thank you for this  I knew there was more I was missing but hadn t had this happen to me yet  So wasn t too sure about the dynamics of it all  Got burnt a bit on the COPE USDC pool so that was a great learning lesson for me  Hope to never have that double whammy scenario play out LOL Acceleraytor is going to start a frenzy  it s going to be amazing  It s definitely what I m looking forward to the most  short term  from the solana ecosystem What could be the reasons s  according to you for keeping   removing the beta Tag  Let us know what you have in mind Thank you See the curve here  https   images app goo gl H9xo1Q286hb8ujqM8 this is for a pool allocated 50 50 which most are  The curve changes with diff allocations e g  20 80 5 95 like you can see in balancer IL from an asset rising while the other is stagnant is no big deal  you make money even though you lose coins since your coins are now worth more  The big issue with IL is when one of the coins drops big in value  The IL from a coin losing value while the other is stagnant is exponential  while the IL from one gaining while other stagnant is linear  So if one tanks  you lose exponentially from IL but also the value of your underlying coins drops  so it s a double wammy  Plus while this is happening  the yield typically drops  This scenario is the what you need to worry about with yield farming Then your justification for the beta tag still being present doesn t make sense That doesn t imply what you just said  Development will not stop even when the beta tag is removed  Development is not linked to Bug fixing only  it s linked to scalability  interoperability  new features     you name it That implies there will be a time where the protocol is not under development with improvements and bug fixes I think you re right that this makes Solana centralized from a true sense of the word  but many competitors who call Solana centralized that claim to be decentralized suffer from the same issues  Avalanche being a main one  they are dependent on Ava Labs  and they have no plans to implement slashing at all because it s not a necessary piece for their consensus  Cardano is similar in that regard  reliant on one developer and no slashing  they they claim to be the most decentralized chain on the market The rewards are currently so high on this particular pool that impermanent loss is not something I m worried about  If the APY was only 50   then I might keep closer tabs on it  But at 250  300   any impermanent loss that might happen in the short term is negligible in comparison with the rewards Guests Online Right Now       Anatoly    CEO Co founder     Austin

you settle transactions I assumed it s old pool which is no longer available Significant Impermanent loss happens when one of the assets you are pairing rises 25   while the other stays stagnant  The way Impermanent loss works is that when you pair your 2 coins for Liquidity  you are doing it a a specific ratio relative to the current prices  If those prices fluctuate  there is now an arbitrage between the coins in the LP and the coins trading on markets  Arbitrage traders take advantage of this by swapping coins from the LPs and selling them on marketplace  this is where the IL happens Because arbitrage traders are sniping the profit difference of the increased asset  you will essential see that asset quantity decrease if you unstaked  but would be replaced with the other asset you are paired to in order to maintain that balanced ratio you began with  If KIN goes up 25   while RAY stays flat  you will have more RAY than KIN originally staked If RAY goes up 25   while KIN is flat  you will have more KIN than RAY originally stakedIf both go up relatively 25   you will not have significant IL as the pairing ratio is maintained relatively  If I m wrong about this someone plz correct me  Hope some of this helps I had originally purchased Kin2 on Interstellar in 2019  Then I swapped for Kin3 using Simpleswap later that year  Then  with Kin4  the migration was automatic Cools thanks   Do you know what the legacy tab represents in the pools tab by any chance Thanks etan1   I ll give that a shot when I get home from work  and post here how it goes   Thanks Everyone for all the replies   Much appreciated Hello   You do pay taxes when you sell crypto  and your capital gains are   Amount you got when you sold it   Amount you paid when you bought it   Fees  The problem is  you never bought the crypto     you were  gifted  it so to speak   I use Koinly to track my crypto transactions for tax purposes  and I m staking some other coins as well   Every time I enter my stake rewards in Koinly for those other coins  it increase the  Income  bucket by the   amount of the staking rewards    Amount I received    Fair Market Value at the time the rewards were disbursed    It s because of that we need to know the exact time and date the rewards were disbursed  in addition to the amount disbursed   1 SOL coin earned as staking today might yield  28 income  whereas in 1 year 1 SOL coin might yield  100 in income  hopefully     I m quite confident that Delicious _Context _53 post above is accurate   Why would crypto tax software applications track staking rewards as Income if the IRS didn t need to know about it   I also tried out CoinTracker  and it did the same thing  so  I do believe it s necessary to report staking rewards when filing taxes  at least in the U S   Not sure how it works in other countries   Thanks When you harvest  it goes to wallet  You will have to pair it before staking it again  As for IL  I believe it happens when there s huge variation of the price  It doesn t mean you make a loss though  It means you would have gained more have you not invested in the LP https   www mwe com insights taxation of virtual currency staking activities https   www irs gov individuals international taxpayers frequently asked questions on virtual currency transactions In the US stake rewards do not yet have clear tax guidance  The dominant guidance is that if you received crypto and didn t purchase it  it is taxed as income  The implication for staking is that when you receive the reward  it is taxed as income at its market value  And then when you sell it  it is taxed again as cap gain  Obviously this sucks  I have written my congressional rep about this I think the same tax interpretation applies to mining rewards as well  by the way Hm  no I hadn t planned on that   I was focusing just on direct Solana staking   I could think about what you suggest in a future update though Thx i will wrote there over 100 per validator Just out of curiosity  will you also include Serum   Raydium rewards there  Would definitely be a very useful tool to have  as for token rewards there is not even a CLI option right now Install the Solana command line interface  then  the command is  solana stake account YOUR STAKE ADDRESSThis produces a list with all SOL rewards and a running balance totalas well as projected APR info  It does not include info about the commission that your validator charged during each interval  only your net gain The CLI is not perfect because it only shows epoch  not time and date  but epochs happen regularly in 2 3 intervals  Also be careful when switching between staking pools  as withdrawing a stake account and then creating a new one overwrites the history of the old one  so make a fresh export before you withdraw Don t you pay taxes only if you sell  I m not a tax expert but thought it was the sale or exchange that creates a taxable event That s awesome PandaPoles    but how did you do it   Searching how to Swap erc20 Kin  Kin1  for Kin4 Solana seems to be an endless  wormhole  pun intended  of information  Thanks for your help If you know the address of your staking account  then you can go to the Solana CLI and type command  solana stake account  account address I m aware  And I m also aware SOL can do 50k tps  Anatoly knows what s he s speaking Um  you are aware that the testing we are talking about is specifically testing scaling right But you can always move the goalposts   Next it will be that the software wasn t tested on a Tuesday   Then it will be that it wasn t tested on a Tuesday during a full moon   Etc Same code works differently depending on the scale of the project Theoretically yes with an APY that high  however  that won t last forever and it s already dropped by 400  since I started  though at 700  still is pretty high Having said that I m unsure of how the actual cope return was calculated  e g was it on the cope price  amount or LP    might try looking into that later on  but the thing is if you keep getting cope and it becomes say worthless  then your reward is   not really valuable  on top of that you ll exit with more cope  which seems to be worst case I m still learning a lot but I felt the experience helped a lot with my understanding  Also don t forget to stake some RAY for a potential airdrop in the future Yeah not sure how it relates to taxes  Unless they are cashing it out or something Wow  That would be great  Please do keep me posted Thanks I appreciate hearing counter arguments and I don t know where to get this kind of information so it s good reading for me I am working on a site to do exactly this  and more    It may be a while  but hopefully before 2022 tax season when you would need to report any 2021 Solana

long did you end up waiting As a quick and dirty test  I picked one of the figures   Cardano s transactions per second  tps    and did some fast research  In short  what I found is that this chart seems to be unreliable If you want to pull at the thread for yourself  then here ya go    How many transactions per second   TPS   can Cardano do  and what does this mean for the network   https   www reddit com r Cardano_ELI5 comments la7ptu how_many_transactions_per_second_tps_can_cardano gpkpr97     Cardano  One million transactions per second   Hydra paper published  https   www crypto news flash com cardano one million transactions per second hydra paper published     No  Visa Doesn t Handle 24 000 TPS and Neither Does Your Pet Blockchain  https   news bitcoin com no visa doesnt handle 24000 tps and neither does your pet blockchain  In a nutshell  what I found is that Cardano s current  actual  speed is estimated to be about 5 7 tps  However  this isn t exactly a speed cap  If they stopped development today and decided that they only cared about speed  then they could a single parameter and clip along at about 50 250 tps   So  the chart isn t pulling the 250 number from nowhere  but it s very misleading   They ve set it way  way lower than what the current implementation can handle because the blocks would end up being mostly empty  which would mean wasting a ton of hard drive space for everyone running a full node  As more people use the network  they change the parameter But Cardano isn t going to stop development today  One of the major things on their roadmap is something called Hydra  which will dramatically increase the tps  A conservative worst case scenario would have Hydra deliver  only  about 2 500 tps  A more optimistic analysis concludes that it could easily deliver more than a million tps  based on simulations showing that each  Hydra head   stake pool  could process about 1 000 tps and therefore it d only take 1 000 stake pools to deliver a millions tps All of this is a little silly though because the real world is what matters when it comes to the type of ubiquitous uptake everybody dreams about  Visa processes roughly 1 700 tps  and is already capable of much more than that   and when is the last time that caused a problem for you at a checkout register  I m enough of a geek to appreciate being able to achieve insanely fast hypothetical speeds on a distributed system  but I don t want to lose sight of real world usage and regular people s perception of speed Anyway  it s possible that I was just unlucky when I picked Cardano s tps to check the usefulness of the chart  Maybe the rest of the numbers are accurate without being misleading  But yeah  based on my quick and dirty test  this chart seems unreliable  Solana is on the list of cryptocurrencies that I like  and that s why I want to discourage posting things that make the project look like yet another snake oil seller  Representing data in a trustworthy way matters  and that s a higher bar than being technically correct It is mainstream enough  considering that the kin token is on Solana  The currency used by potentially 300 million active users from Kik

t cost per transaction much lower on Solana What you mentioned seems more like the fee to add a token Nice Thanks I tried a different browser  Chrome  and it worked  I was going to do that but the video I watched used Brave  which is my default  so I was glad to try it and did not think my issues was browser linked So this happened to me  I ended up using moonlet to creat the wallet on ledger  Then I went back to solflare and it was able to read the wallet and I did everything as normal Great thing I saw this I am about to stake within the wallet  Hopefully it s fixed by the time I need to unstake  4 days isn t too long compared to 21 days with some coins Smart contract risk I m in the same boat  Personally  I like ALGO better and idk why  Solana is incredible  but I ve always been drawn to ALGO Can also convert for it in Exodus Wallet  Use XLM  XRP or ALGO  ATOM works for conversion too I ll harvest my raydium every time I log on to my computer    even if it s like   10 cents   It works so well  is so fast  and I d never do that on any other chain This That is the killer feature of Solana  Dapp should not copy paste ETH BSC dapp but embrace prof of history What does this mean  Can you elaborate some more Placing the community first  through proper token incentives  supply distribution  and a guarantee of allocation  This ensures a predictable token value model and raises expectations on token demand ETH 2 0 will also have 64 shards  A single zk rollup can handle 20k TPS on POS  20 000 x 64   1 2M tps  On top of that there s optimism  validium  etc   ETH will be doing millions of TPS on later 2 in a couple years Not the same usage  Solana has Proof of History that can be used for many use cases The way I see it  it is not an ETH killer but a blockchain with a vertical use case  In the same way FLOW could become the blockchain for NFTs If your question is referring to BTC fees  you can use XLM for transfer between Coinbase and Binance  and XRP SOL for cheap and fast transfer between Binance and FTX  Solana is quite unknown still  so not listed everywhere  As this is not just another Ethereum token it also needs additional infrastructure on the exchange site Having said that  you can use sollet io to transfer directly from ETH   BTC into SOL  You ll need a tiny SOL balance to bootstrap but for small balance you can just use moonpay com to get some with credit card Yes  correct i might get into that with the wrong   wording    Thank you for the in depth clarification  that s what staking is  Slashing isn t implement yet as you already know about it Delegating to multiple validators is always great alternative aside from Slashing implemented or not  it s good for the whole network health   gt  I personally found it fun to download  learn  and use the solana command line client for this sort of thing  but not everyone enjoys the same things I do    True  not everyone enjoy using the  CLIs  it s like convincing someone newbie to trading to choose between a Dex  amp  Cex  he ll definitely choose a CEX over a Dex  but a CLI is so much helpful managing multiple stake accounts I m also having this issue using Solflare  Cope and usdt doesn t show the nice beautiful icon  it rather display the complete adress That s brilliant  thank you for taking the time to explain   amp  x200B Do you know if there are any risks involved in this third party  My main concern is staking the full amount of coins  which is a fair amount  then some sort of rug pull or something like that occurring yes  It is true that they have much higher trading volume than Serum But  since Serum s entire order book is on chain  it creates an enormous number of transactions on the Solana blockchain  most of those being cancel orders  I m excited to see what new applications are made possible from having an on chain order book I believe the lower number does not count coins held by the foundation as part of the circulating supply and  IOTA unfortunately im a noob and have too lil knowledge of this stuff to answer that  was just curious as to what Sol s move will be if Eth is reaching 100k tps sometime Just tried with GoogleChrome  amp  it shows the COPE token name perfectly well  https   i postimg cc L8t1vMHH image png  https   i postimg cc L8t1vMHH image png PS  my COPE token address was added mote than 10 days ago Will ETH be doing their hypothetical 100k tps without sharding  like Solana Why is it set up so one has to buy Bitcoin on one exchange  then move it to another exchange to  buy Solana  then likely have to move it to a wallet somewhere else https   twitter com mccannatron status 1382799202330185728 s 20 Scroll down to 3 2 Token supply distribution https   research binance com en projects solana It s this way  let s take a platform  exchange  solFlare validator s  Staking app       yes you kind of TRUST them  amp  you give them your SOL for staking in order to get the reward  you re still able to UnDelegate   Un Stake your SOL whenever you want to though By giving your SOL to that Third Party  i know what you mean now   you just GIVE them your SOL for X amount of time until you decide to take them back  whenever you want to  I hope this answers your question Thank you for explaining  Yes it was my lack of knowledge that led me to believe that staking means   you send your coins to another platform  what I meant by third party  and therefore no longer have custody yeah tried the 2 days  as average  but 3 days seems more accurate  around 2   3 days  Calculating with 3 Days  an Epoch  will give him more SOL as Reward if it s really 12  APR  which is not IMO   this means whether they are taking more FEEs or the APR they are giving isn t so accurate  amp  is probably around 8 8  APR   0 666  Per Month0 666  Per Month   30 Days   0 0222   Per Day0 0222   Per Day Of 11 269 68 SOL   2 501718 SOL2 501718 SOL X 3 days  an Epoch    7 505154 SOLThey Gave Him  6 8 SOL7 505154 SL   6 8 SOL     0 705154 SOL  Their FEE    10 369  FEE  Here we got the same Result as the last calculation but with an Epoch that lasts 3 days only   8  ARP   So it s not 12  APR  it s 8  only with an Epoch of 3 days Only person in the thread who has it right What did I miss But epochs are not 2 days   That is where your calculations fail   Epochs are about 3 days now  so you have to reduce your calculated APY by about 1 3  which is exactly what the OP is seeing and unhappy about Yes sorry my bad  but it s still right Its not per day  Its per epoch Also  if ETH becomes deflationary due to EIP 1559  I am not well versed enough to know if this will truly happen   I feel like that will guarantee Eth s near to mid term dominance And Elrond Staking means sending   giving your SOL to a validator  that validator earns   you earn  it s that simple  No idea what you mean by   Third Party   in here  does it mean you keep your SOL in a wallet you trust more  but they are still staking  amp  earns you rewards  Staking doesn t work this way their marketcap is ranked by low TPS to high TPS LMAO SOL looks superior and it s still in beta thanks for your unsightful reply  I had a feeling it wont reach that amount by summer  but It ll happen eventually sometime in the future thats my only concern as a sol holder Eth will scale 100x due to roll ups in July  Eip 1559 will not scale ethereum  Another 100x scaling will happen when the chain goes full POS and introduces sharding  100k tps is probably about two years away on Ethereum You can stake using ledger with solflare and moonlet  And I believe you can also use raydium and ledger together Doesn t uniswap sushi trade way more than Serum Honestly I m only concerned with the fees  It would be great to get a larger list of all the crypto coins with a fee comparison mostly consensus and Serum I would suggest a footnote in each box that references a resource for each data point gathered  I think that would stimulate a healthier discussion No it s right  I don t see anything wrong with gettin paid 6 sol per day for the amount you have staked Project serum  raydium  mango markets  orca No fix yet  Just did this same thing with a large amount of money  Have you tried reaching out to the dev team Jeez you got your bags packed  I feel like a lil guppey now Any idea on fix So glad Kin is on the Solana blockchain They don t wanna talk about that Please provide a resource  sounds very theoretical and pie in the sky that eth will go from 15 to 100k tps with one update how does it compare to avax An interesting fact of solana is the poh  proof of history   dont know how many others provide same tech and it s fast  but ETH2 will come up to 100k TPS What about compared to algorand  Right now I m torn inbetween algo and sol  both seems like solid projects I used Mathwallet   It s not same as Mathwallet Thank you for your comment Fellow SOL holder here with a genuine question  What happens after EIP rolls out in summer  ETH will be supporting up to 100k TPS by then  How s that going to impact SOL Is there anywhere I can get an update on projects launching on solana  Is there a DEX or any defi activity on the network Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns yeah idk    I know BSC just hit an all time high of 152 TPS this past week  Also there is a new block every 3 seconds on BSC so im not exactly sure how the latency is 75 seconds   not trying to take away from the obvious dominance of technological advancements that solana has over other chains but some of the info isn t correct It s not an issue until you lose

that is what it was Believing that Satoshi really had 8 million BTC and that I was already late to the party when I started using bitcoin in 2011 is what led me to eventually give up on it after only a couple of weeks   That was a big mistake  at least a big financial mistake   Not saying Solana is anything like that  just saying that sometimes you  are  the early adopter even when it doesn t feel like it This is the details of COPE token  add it manually in your Sollet wallet    Contract Address    3K6rftdAaQYMPunrtNRHgnK2UAtjm2JwyT2oCiTDouYE    Decimals    6  Source     https   solanabeach io

Yes but it didn t show COPE for me  not sure why  Tried the above method  amp  appears to have added it  Will look to purchase some shortly to confirm Except there s more than one person holding a majority of tokens here and this isn t bitcoin i recall hearing the argument the  Satoshi  kept 8 million bitcoin near the time of initial offering and people made the same claims then but the proof in the current market seems to be all we have that this is a standard method of preservation  though some people have said they were simply  lost  but that seems like a mute point here  just thought I d mention Nooooo   That s sad to hear    What Wallet did it go to   Please everyone double Triple quadruple check everything  No solana investments are out at the moment Me too  but you can get it through Blockfolio  Ftx us and binance us This is the scam website   https   solstarter investments    https   solstarter investments     Oh my god  I just lost 10 ETH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO        I just lost 10 ETH   The scam website is  https   solstarter investments    https   solstarter investments What wallet are you using  For Sollet  you just click the   sign at the top right of the list and find  COPE  Adding tokens costs  002039 SOL May as well I agree  whales holding alot of coins is an issue   I have been told that this is common for many most crypto projects at this stage of development  but still it kinda sucks Your assertion that they ve not scaled or proven their work is just patently false   The exact same software running on testnet proved it   Nobody runs stress test on production systems  and there s no reason to  the software has already been proven to achieve those TPS numbers The fact that it takes an epoch to de stake means that there is some natural friction preventing everyone who is staked from selling out at once   The de stake interval gets longer the more people try to de stake in an epoch  even further restricting this kind of panic selling   That s not to say that whales cannot de stake and sell out  but it should be possible to see it coming at least if you pay attention You might want to fo to coinmarketcap and copy the address from there  I did the same to my Sollet wallet Already posted in here   https   www reddit com r solana comments ms0hfn solana _vs _ethereum _vs _binance _smart _chain _vs   https   www reddit com r solana comments ms0hfn solana_vs_ethereum_vs_binance_smart_chain_vs I use exodus in the US i like the concept but i don t know if i want to put money on smth twitter controls Are you seriously comparing doge to solana Like the top couple percent that hold all the tokens here that can crash the coin at any moment by selling off  Looks like dogecoin to me but with exaggerated claims and no real world proof  Only good thing is the staking There s literally 5 exchanges that have all the volume  2 of which we are listed  What more exchanges do you want  Whales can do whatever they want Mmm nah I won t  doesn t say whales won t unload and you listed one exchange   you re proving my point Bingo I m not sure what you mean about scaling  Actually Solana has the highest TPS of a decentralized network  If you mean about ecosystem  new projects are being created every month  We have already a DEX and a stable coin working  Among the exchanges with Solana  Binance  the most Important trades Solana  It s normal to have very few listings when the project didn t really launch until January  Actually  when new exchanges start listing SOL  expect a higher price  I don t know  but to me  PoH looks like the best solution to the trilemma and a project that has more potential than many others on the top10    Just my opinion 1  it s on Ftx us Not sure why you need another exchange  You can also swap on exodus so that s dumb 2  SBF doesnt seem like a person to fuck around  Scaling  Ummm seems like everyday a new project is been built on the blockchain  Not sure how much more proof of scaling you need  3  shaky things  Maybe I can t argue there  since I don t code  Perhaps Anatoly can speak on those other subjects As for the whales dumping  Mmmm nah I won t For some reason having my Ledger Live open while trying to connect caused this issue  A little confused  but I have gained access to my Solflare account Doge is a pump and dump the whole coin has no utilization  We re talking about Solana here You mean doge Must always DYOR   Cope was the community choice for the most recent Solana Hackathon  I had missed the airdrop but got in early because I couldn t  cope  Cyrii the creator is active on twitter  I m happy to answer any questions but this is not financial advice Can advise me something  Do I have to care what COPE coin do Yep  Since what they actually care about is transaction speed and decentralization  which is relevant because making the ledger consume less hard drive space is important if you want lots of people to run full nodes  as they ve chosen to do   they re happy to keep it dialed in proportion to the actual network activity  And since Cardano seems to be growing pretty successfully  it seems like they made a good choice for their project goals  But of course  I still think everybody who knows about Hydra is looking forward to it because faster  is  better  And like I said  Solana is super fast  today https   finematics com impermanent loss explained Yes thank you  that s very helpful  According to that  more transactions on that block chain means more data shared with every user on the network  which obviously doesn t scale   So they could change the maximum block size by setting one parameter  but only if they can accept the greater data load on the network Binance menu  gt  binance earn  gt  locked stakingOr something like that I don t exactly recall 0 0001 sol  it may be 0 00001 i don t remember And that Cope liquidity pool with APY of more than 600   Almost don t even wanna bring it up Intolerable losses  At least with dual token you have a chance of the other going up  while stable coin will always be stable  At least this is my assumption If you want to be off Binance but feel private wallet is still too confusing   afraid to lose the seed or whatever  FTX com also has Solana staking available for non US people  It s also custodial  they own your funds  but at least you don t have everything on Binance If you want to sign up to FTX with my referral code for 5  off fee feel free to ping me a direct message Will check  thanks for the info Just staked solana on exodus  easy   It says I can unstake in 4   days   Idk about binance staking I wasn t able to  says out of stock or something Yeah mine doesn t show any rewards  counting on it being fixed soon Exodus has staking now Every 2 3 days you can enter   exit SOL staking  Moonlet app on iOS also works with ledger if Solflare is confusing Can biy direct on blockfolio too Thats what i use  exodus  they are just having issues with showing the rewards on app  Currently 10 77 apy Not an Exodus user but looking forward to download and check the Solana stacking Is the staking locked for some period like Binance or it is flexible  It is very convenient in Binance tbh  but private wallet is always a better option Tried to check on Solflare but i think it is kinda confusing yeah exodus is nice I think I m going to use it Why not use solflare or exodus If you have come so far  and also taking a long term view on Solana  how about research a bit more into Liquidity Pool of Sol and Raydium  It gives you APY of more than 100   and you learn something too Don t know about that I stake all my sol through Binance app I see  what about trust wallet You need to go to staking and transfer sol from your spot into locked staking The simplest way is to have an Exodus wallet and Stake with one click you re welcome friend  I know soon you ll be interested in the cross chain lending marketplace they are launching this Q2 Gonna hafta look into Benchmark  Cheers

wildfire like a raptor evangelist  Well  as I understand it  it can be used with every crypto in existence   This is HUGE imo What has Solana to do about it And Hathor Also  project serum YouTube channel has great podcasts about Solana this is what I actually look out for  when the APY is about this range of 200 300   I don t fear the IL coming in as over time the rewards do cancel out these effects and that s what  Benchmark Protocol  https   benchmarkprotocol finance  is doing with her pool  Benchmark protocol available on Solana via its xMARK token I created a wallet just now  You have to open the Solana app on your Ledger device otherwise you re getting the error you show in your picture You can install the app with Ledger Live I tried on Twitter and Serum discord and got nothing  It was only a few hundred dollars so I don t care but a good learning lesson  I m sorry if you lost more You can buy it direct via https   www moonpay com  it s a brilliant fiat on off ramp   linked to the solana ecosystem Search for the FTX podcast  they sometimes cover Solana I thought this explained it well   How many transactions per second   TPS   can Cardano do  and what does this mean for the network   https   www reddit com r Cardano_ELI5 comments la7ptu how_many_transactions_per_second_tps_can_cardano gpkpr97 Why don t they change that single parameter then   My guess is because that s a  gross  simplification and that it s not nearly that easy Yes I agree   Clarity is what is needed   There are a million ways to make things less clear and few ways to make them clearer   And once things have been muddled  it takes a long time and a lot of education to get the truth out there again Sweet ill check it out  i Listened to the unchained one  was pretty good So far Ive only heard of one it s from the head of Solanas dev team and certain guests from the ecosystem https   podcast solana com I was using a Mac   macOS Big Sur version 11 1 and the Brave browser Don t get me wrong  I love projects build on Solana  but the model of Solstarter to tackle problem like fair distribution  bot front running retails  etc  is still very unclear to me  amp  x200B AcceleRaytor IDO model looks fine for me We let a lot of big guy come in our seed round and we sell higher price token to take care of little guy 100  sounds logic to me Does SolFlare support Ledger Nano X   https   solflare com    Yes  it does  although we ve seen some issues with Microsoft devices  so please be advised that Windows users may encounter some problems when connecting to SolFlare with their Ledger Nano X  This issue has also been acknowledged by Ledger and we re working on finding a way around it Babb claimed to be a bank for crypto   Claiming they had government meetings with a few countries   This coin was worth next to nothing but it s pumped with everything elseI was going to sell my shares and put it into KIN  but now it s worth a bit  So I ll just roll the dice on it Polygon Matic Network would be a great 2nd layer solution to ETH Dapps  Just gotta make the UI and UX better What about Polygon  Matic Network And ETH 2 0 Like I said  they have it set to that right now but they can scale it up by changing a single parameter  It can already handle way more tps than what they re running it at It s sort of like how you _could_ drive your car at its maximum speed and brake as soon as you get to a red light  and then do that over and over all the way to the grocery store  but it d just be wasteful  You wouldn t actually get to the supermarket appreciably faster  so why waste the fuel  Only with Cardano  it s hard disk space instead of petrol  I hope that makes sense But yeah  still  waaaay  slower than Solana  Hydra will make Cardano super fast  but Solana is super fast _today _ I agree with 100  of what you re saying _and_ think that the chart has room for improvement from an information design perspective  Being technically correct is actually a very low bar To give one example of how the chart is omitting information in a way that makes it misleading  it fails to mention that it s examining things that are still in early stages of development  Is it fair to examine things as they currently are  Yes  but it s a bit like taking a photo of one chef s cake that was just taken out of the oven and comparing it to a photo of another chef s cake that recently went into the oven  It s technically correct to say that s what they are both cakes are like  but  that one just went into the oven  is a pretty important bit of information to omit And please let me repeat that I like Solana a lot  My issue is with the chart  not Solana  It s precisely because I like Solana so much that I think things that can affect its reputation should be held to high standards  I hope that makes sense Wow 5 7 tps that sucks donkeys balls guess they dont need speed tho cause they dont have anything working or running on there network Lots of projects can talk theory about what they think that can achieve   It s all vaporware until they do it Solana is using techniques that are actually performance enhancing   most other projects I have seen just hand wave around details and hope and pray that their techniques would actually work   And most of the time  there are gaping holes even in their theory that really don t leave any confidence that they will work Solana is nice because it actually does work   The testnet has been run thoroughly to verify the TPS claims   Mainnet is solid and reliable and already running a TPS that exceeds anything else  and could do more if only there were more transactions to be run Maybe other projects will get there too   But knowing how special Solana s tech is and knowing how much effort went into optimizing every aspect of it  I will remain skeptical of other blockchain s claims of speed until they actually prove it in real world operating situations Welcome  Can you give us a brief explanation on Babb Exodus is also good The regulatory environment doesn t allow this the   gained will outperform the IL  you won t feel it in terms of USD interesting thanks for sharing  do you know if US citizens may legally purchase this as an asset
2021-04-18,25.13550181,32.90256908,21.5392092,Also  Raydium  https   raydium io swap gt Also  just curious how this would play out with transactions being so cheap  What happens to APY  when you can compound a Million times a day Not much  The higher the interest the more you make from very frequent compounding  Usually though there isn t much of a difference between compounding a few times a day or once a day Isn t that Serum DEX I haven t tried Orca yet but they seem to have some very nice pairs  I had to buy a lot of RAY to provide liquidity on Raydium because there isn t a SOL SRM pair yet There would have to be an optimal rate of compounding somewhere given that gas fees are still non zero  maybe this could be found mathematically Isn t that FTX No developer friendly  and no validator reward friendly So you actually need a 4 000  computer and to stake 18 000   at the current sol price  Then you also speculate in sol price  because you keep sol and your rewards are in sol  And if in the future reaches a moderate 50 billion   cap  you would need 140 000  to stake to run a validator    No normal person is going to enter in that Another thing that i like from Orca is it shows the rate   is worse better from Coingecko Maybe its not very important  but its good to have that Ok  i think that was the case  Because i have not added the token to my wallet  Thanks for the info But i think it should be fixed by Raydium team  because i just switched to Orca after that  with the same condition  and the transaction succeed The  transaction too large  error usually means 2 things you don t have enough liquidity to swap or make lp tokens  or you didn t add the tokens you want to swap in the wallet  To swap sol in ray  for example  you have to add ray token in the wallet  with the  add token  function   before you can successfully swap  Hope it help I also have that problem sometimes example if I try to swap SOL  gt USDT and it fail  I would swap SOL  gt RAY and from there RAY  gt USDT  And te rates are not even that bad  But idk maybe I should check out Orca It based on personal experience but i keep getting the  transaction too large  issue in RaydiumThe UX in orca is nice and simple I tried to swap on Raydium  but got this notification Swap failedTransaction too large 1348 gt 1232 And its also a bit laggy tbh  Rate also worse compared to bonfida  maybe its not a common issue  I do not know I found its very simple to do it in orca and the rate is quite good  Fast  no need to settle Also remember when you are looking for some coin address  always go to coinmarketcap or coingecko  Never ever copy by someone that send it to you What make you think its better than Raydium  Can you give us more details In order to integrate the token logo and name  do we have to email each wallet support  ie  sollet  solong  to be to see the name reflected in the wallet instead of the token address  Or how does it work currently on solana to have a name  as well as a logo on the solana explorer   for your tokens and nfts Low af Why do you consider it a lot better do i need to settle transaction in Raydium  i never tried it  i used Bonfida a few times because it has better rate compared to Raydium  amp  x200B But yes  it was confusing experience  i thought i was losing my fund before i realized that i need to settle it We are still growing compared to them ye but we take an example from uniswap or pancakeswap  the highest liquidity is eth stablecoin and bnb stablecoin  cmiiw  Just think it is kinda weird  but maybe i was wrong Nah  I didn t have 8 million bitcoins Thanks Was this the wrong time to invest money in wok Hi  curious were you able to get staking rewards to show up in the cli  I m running into the same issue as you Um did you do  any  research at all before posting Thank you so much  Yes after seeing strong recovery in SOL   much more convinced in this coin now  I should have just staked SOL and RAY separately instead of farming  Regret doing this This is a pretty good summary  but I think it could be simplified a little I think the key points are   Solana is fast because it uses a pre determined leader schedule that all validators calculate the same way without having to communicate with each other since the schedule is a function of data already on the blockchain   Blocks are only accepted if they follow that leader schedule   In this way  random validators cannot insert themselves into the schedule   To prevent validators from  skipping  the validator that comes before them  Proof of History is used to force all validators to spend a minimum amount of time before they could even submit their block   Thus if validator B follows validator A  B cannot try to skip A by chaining off its previous block  because B has to run the Proof of History algorithm at least as long as A does  so A will get a fair chance of submitting their block One question  Is anyone else s balance stagnant staking on exodus  I staked on April 11 and my balance hasn t moved since I haven t tried recently  and am currently not near a computer  but trying different browsers sometimes does the trick I don t know how to do the math on that  sorry   But if you believe that the prices will continue to change relative to each other  you should probably get out before you lose more   Or if you think they are going to come back in line  then you should stay in to recoup your losses Or maybe you have no expectation either way about what will happen   In which case  why are you investing in something that you have no expectations of Better to just buy and hold SOL honestly      if  you are bullish on SOL that is What do you mean  no one asks why     You don t think anyone and everyone who owns Solana asks themselves that question all the time I know  I was baffled  So many times I think about ADA  DOT and others that are barely moving and then Solana makes me doubt diversification It is a DEX based on Solana i sold half of my SOL  Banging my head against the wall now I see that the yield is a multiple of Validator Uptime  which is determined by Vote Credits    https   solana com staking validatoruptime  https   solana com staking validatoruptime Not sure how skip   affects vote credits though Dude what the fuck is going on It s hard to assume how it will play out with whales this big  I could see benefit of founder paying employees or contractors with coin  But there s other whales too  I m still trying to get in on this because it s rallying up real good and even if their performance is possibly exaggerated a bit it can t be THAT exaggerated so it s probably still a good coin  I just don t like being mislead on a concept Letters go up   goodLetters go down   bad It s good with me   I like keeping up on news on coins   Hate to miss news on what moves these things  lol It s all about decentralization You get higher tps with higher centralization  It s a tradeoff Whale only issue I see in your argument  But also can be turned into one of it benefit  founder wants this to revolutionize the world of crypto  I started investing and following when it was 120 by market cap  I want the founder to sell for  100m and then hire an army of people to keep on developing  If they do it right  and use their cash to grow   this will be the blockchain to kill all other blockchains  They have the team that can achieve it   this is why I invested in the first place There s no news AFAIK  Just chugging along You re getting almost 7 of these coins every three days and you re complaining about the APY  Almost all of these aren t accurate and many exchanges or wallets randomly change guidelines to take commissions without telling you  21 coins a month for free at a rate of 30  a coin isn t bad for a little over 300k  Taking into account the coin growth  I m not sure if I buy into all they claim they re capable of but the APY and the recent rally are impressive   and today s instant recovery Don t overthink everything my friend haha true Disclaimer  I hold SOL  But it is unbelievably funny that no one asks why  And don t tell me fundamentals    Not complaining  just saying I got this image from https   www coinparticle com What s the news on solana  Just doing it s own thing Awesome I wrote an article about it a couple month ago https   lsmod medium com what makes solana the fastest public blockchain cb8ffde1a7f4 Oh shit I had no idea  thanks for letting me know OP  I don t feel quite as bad about the state of my portfolio now haha I m a total noob  but I bought some ADA through Coinbase pro which was easy  Then transferred it to Exodus wallet which was easy and low fees  Then exchanged the ADA for SOL inside of Exodus which was easy and the fees were actually negative at the time I did it  I made money on the exchange  This definitely isn t common though  I lost a big chunk of money in Exodus when I started because I didn t understand the interface  Some exchanges will cost you like 10  if you aren t careful  Exodus has 10 71  staking as of today makes sense to me I guess my last comment is now invalid  We are going to the moon boys I feel proud of it Solana is a thoroughbred with real believers in its utility  That helps a lot with the noise of volatility swirling around it It is just the best smart contract layer  layer 1  out there and people are starting to recognize it Super easy Yeah SOL going on a tear Is this bc the airdrop network gotten more users and ppl are seeing this as undervalued compared to ETH Raydium and Maps  both at a discount right

opposite   stay steady when the market will try to come up What is orca and how is it related to SOL yep ive tried it   last night    i was actually using the fusion thing there as well    which it nice Try using raydium io i feel it s much easier to swap Most things in my portfolio are still green on the 7 14 day metric  this dip was WAY overplayed  I threw more money in on a couple boats I missed safemoon also survived ahhh well logged off  and reconnected wallet    and it finally showed up in pending balances    settled and it worked   strange it didnt show untill i disconnected and reconnected my wallet    all is good now Was my only green most of today although VET has joined it now   Makes me think I should give SOL a little more love each top up day seeing as it shows it can withstand a crunch better than most of the others yea   i have multiple times Make sure you settled transactions https   explorer solana com tx

there is a time lag when unstaking coins to actually getting them back again  A day or so Exodus wallet is CLEEEEAN It will be a nice move  AcceleRaytor is coming and RAY stake is needed to join  Considering to add more  because of the discounted price today  will see in the next few days Orca is nice for the UI UX  but i heard that the rate is not that good  will try a few swaps again and see Thx How it will not survive  The market distribution for sol is like 70 private and company  to 30  people Have a look for Solflare Tokens are staked on a large scale in the coins that had a big selloff too  that s not unique to Solana  The market is hungry for  SOL 20 30  crash in moat tokens  resulting in a price last seen a month back is far from being slaughtered Lol  This was not even close to a bloodbath  You weren t here in 2017 it seems I would just call it a standard crypto correction  bloodbath has not occurred yet this cycle IMO  Solana is doing beautifully though  I agree I wonder if this is because we are either lucky  or everyone has their tokens staked and couldn t sell them during the panic  Hoping the market comes to its senses and we don t see a sell off tomorrow

a regular if there is enough demand If you did like the content  please do drop a Like and a Sub on youtube The way solflare sollet current works right now is only one device can stay connected to the ledger at any given time  You can see the tab that has active USB connection with an icon on the current solflare tab  If that tab  or connection with ledger live  is open  then you will not be able to access the ledger in another tab  The UX is a bit better once you start using phantom wallet because it only tries to access the ledger on a per action basis Raydium is a good place to farm bro  High APR and alot of variety If someone still has issues even after having enough sol in the account to cover fees  try the  Settle all  button which worked for me As per Anatoly s response  founder of Solana  to this same question a couple months ago     About 40  are votes  40  are serum order messages  cancels bid ask  Transactions are a poor measurement of a adoption  but a great measurement of system load and capacity  We need a network that is cheap enough to handle the level of messages on Nasdaq  which is 500k per second of mostly cancel orders   https   www reddit com r solana

s guess I tripled my hodling yesterday when I saw how strong it was against BTC dropping   BTC playing tricks again today but still way up just in 24 hours or so So would it be true to say that if this Media Network were supported on solana  then an equivalent answer would be  you can switch over to solana instead of eth and of course pay  lt 0 01  fee  Honest question   I know a good deal about how Solana works  but I am embarrasingly clueless about how other blockchains and other services work If you took consensus transactions out  i e  votes  it would be 500 TPS right now instead of 1 000   That is still significantly faster than everything else out there  and Solana is barely being stressed right now  it can handle a lot more If you are turned off by the fact that the project does not have enough use yet to show bigger TPS numbers  then I guess you don t like being an early adopter   Come back in 6 months So you can compare the actual volume traded on Serum  which you have already accurately done   But I think you are missing the destinction of what an open central limit orderbook actually is  This is where  like on centralized exchanges  you can see all open buy and sell orders for a pairing  You can decide to put in your own limit order or take a market trade  If you have a limit order and it isnt filled yet you can cancel it  change the price  and enter a new one  You simply can t do that on other defi exchanges so these transactions don t exist for them  Do this to look at it and visual the difference  go to www raydium io and click launch app  check out the swap page  this is the portion that is similar to pancakeswap  next check out the trade page  This is the open central limit orderbook You re so welcome puuuh the connecting my wallet makes me a little suspicious but thanks I was haha Thank you so much  It worked  I transfered more sol and I was able to settle  Thanks again I think easy 40  after few days from now    And waiting 100   in the end of cycle To confirm this  over half of transactions are vote transactions   Yes  the mechanism for achieving consensus   votes   is itself a transaction On the one hand  this looks like it artificially inflates the transaction count  since just running the network implies hundreds of transactions per second  and those transactions have to run whether there are other transactions out there or not On the other hand  the fact that the consensus mechanism of the network   that which keeps the network going   is run using the same transaction mechanism that normal transcations run  is very strong proof that the system works   And  the number of votes per second is going to grow slowly over time  so while right now it s 50  or more of the TPS  when Solana is speeding by at 10 000 TPS  it will only represent something like 10  of the overall transactions   And when Solana is at 50 000 TPS  it s an even smaller overall fraction So yeah  when Solana says it can do 50 000 TPS  that is  technically  true  but in terms of useful end user transactions  it can  only  do maybe 49 000 TPS   Since all of these numbers have a bit of a fudge factor built in  in essence 49 000 is approximately the same as 50 000 anyway it s random generated  plus the range raises with each allocation you buy Well for posterity    Solana is not mined  it s a Proof of Stake network  and it achieves consensus via a network of validators   Stake is the means by which validators are kept honest   it gives them skin in the game and makes cheating less profitable than cooperating Running a validator requires significant hardware   4 000 or so if you build from scratch  and more importantly  a very fast and reliable network that can run sustained 120 Mpbs egress  all the time without ever stopping    This typically requires a datacenter  either colo or managed cloud So as you can see  it takes some significant investment and effort to join in And then there is the inevitable problem of acquiring stake   You only make SOL as a validator if you can attract significant stake to your validator   But with 500  validators to compete with right now  it s a tough game   There are efforts underway to create  stake pools  which should help here because they will hopefully spread stake around more evenly helping small validators to acquire enough stake to be profitable   They should be coming along any time within the next few weeks to months Aside from that  you can try to get into the Tour de SOL program if you are not based in the USA   This is a program run by the Solana Foundation and if you can join  the current registrations are now closed  but I think there are more registrations coming up later this month  and can prove the quality of your validator on the testnet  then you can get staked a nice amount by the Foundation   enough to earn tens of thousands of dollars per year at the current SOL price   As you can imagine  everyone and their brother is going to want to join this because  basically  free money  so     be prepared for some competition there too Ah  that probably is the issue  I had less than  1 Thanks I ll give it a shot You need some sol for the fees  something like 0 1 should be enough Also make sure you add serum token to your sollet wallet   Source  Serum Discord      https   discord com channels 739225212658122886

instead just use an xdai faucet to obtain 0 001 xdai and at that point contribute without needing to eat any gas fees at all  quite literally at 0 cost  but the tradeoff is u wont have funds to tip burn with So what makes price difference Check out step finance sir but keep in mind that it s still in Alpha version  it may affect reliability and not security nope  rarity is not tied to price The more expensive the rarer   True Thanks for the reply  please see my replies below for some more questions if you have the time   Thank you Ok  thanks   So the normal function of a running blockchain is put into the number of transactions   So it actually counts as 0 then in terms of duding its popularity  but impressive to be able to handle them nevertheless  In the case of Serum  it seems like negative news again  in terms of me evaluating Solana  because it means its numbers are massively enlarged  so it means the true size of the project user base is tiny in comparison to the number of transactions for it showing up on Solanabeach   which is actually highly misleading as a result   What s the point of even showing them  other than as proof that it can handle a lot   and that part of its transaction capacity is taken up already    therefore indicating inefficiency actually  unless its useful better somehow for them being on chain     In fact  do you happen to know if Solana s apps all have to go  on chain    Doesn t that undermine its efficiency   unless there are side benefits so to speak   Maybe there are Thanks again Ok  thanks   Is there a reason its better to be on chain   One side effect I can see is investors like myself can t compare its usage very easily to other blockchains because its numbers end up being enlarged by all this  normal  stuff adding to the number of TPS   So I need to filter it out  basically  to figure out Solana s true popularity   sounds less good actually   unless there is some benefit I m not aware of    obviously being able to perform that many transactions is impressive    Thanks again pickaxe Market realising there s a future giant here  Great day yesterday versus a bloodbath in the market acting as a giant green billboard saying buy this stock  Idk but I like it Joined     Thank you You are welcome where can u find out the rewards rates Following too  But  maybe they ll be nice Hey what platforn is this Someone is going to come in here and lay a smack down of an answer  I m just waiting He will be here soon I got 6  I don t even know what to do with it  I just roll with it how  I was only allocated six Can you please elaborate what Stake pools are Thanks  Always good to be reminded Mandala Exchange I think its not updating on the main balance  but when you click on staking  tab  for SOL you will able to see the  staked   reward  balance Or 2013 So how do you pass kyc  Even in the us  I live in NY and can t buy solana  The best thing I can think of is asking a friend in another state to buy and send to my cold wallet  just gotta report taxes on your own Oooof when did you do it  We just entered a new epoch like this past hour  so every epoch is 3 days and it takes 1 epoch to activate the coins and then another epoch to start receiving rewards Orca will be the best dex in the world I was able to get in on  SOL at 21 45  I m impressed at how quickly it recovered from the dip Great podcast  thanks for the link   Should be required listening for everyone interested in Solana I agree    this is some whale action here  Given that SOL is still barely known to retail investors  Its definitely something to look into esp since this is the only crypto that has not had natural pullbacks Careful about  up time    Make sure you understand what that means and why it s mis represenated and mis named on solanabeach io Also be careful with re balancing   Each rebalance takes an epoch with no rewards   You have to make significantly better on the redelegated stake to make it worth it   Most validators are within a fraction of a   in APY Also are you aware of stake pools   They might eat your lunch This is pretty un natural    This is the kind of action of when a whale want in the position    I hate to start rumors  but I wouldn t be suppressed if some  big news   is released after the whale fills its stomach He s wrong  That s been closed for a few days  It will likely open back up though  If you can t find staking it s likely that you re using the Lite version of the app  It defaults that way  click your little bubble at the top and switch it to pro mode and find  staking Always doing it s own thing  have you not noticed the pattern I would say to consider seco and holy  I prefer basket tokens rather than individual less reward but significantly less risk  Seco is the serum ecosystem token and has all the major coins backed by ftt  Holy is   only if you want exposure to ftt serum and sol What it looks like to prefer wealth Hello No  they don t show up for me when using the CLI still  I checked earlier today  Sorry it s not working for you either Omg and its now mooning at presale it was random   first allocation was around 0 5 2 sol  and each next pumped a price a bit  Public sale date and pricing is still to be announced what did one cost Explain   Are you moving all your holdings over to xdai and foregoing eth completely in this case We don t know yet  They ll announce it on discord when there is any news Can I get an update on how everything is going Or is it more of a red herring  Is he trying to tell us that he was drinking while he came up with the idea while avoiding any negative connotations that could be associated with that  Wondering if he was actually pretty drunk when he had the initial idea and the coffee was to sober himself up so he could think about it longer Sweet  When does the factory open up again So I read much of the Algorand Pixel whitepaper My impression is that they are doing what I stated above   lateral movements to try to re solve the same problems with the same performance characteristics as previous solutions   They claim that their approach s benefit is in reduced computation requirements for generating signatures  and reduced bandwidth due to novel compression techniques They begin with this fundamental statement of the problem they believe they are solving  Because the distributionof stake changes over time  however  the real assumption behind chain integrity is not just that the adversary currentlycontrols less than a threshold of the stake  but that he neverdid so at any time in the past  They then go on to propose a very complex multi signature method that they say prevents someone from corrupting past blockchain state by acquiring sufficient stake to be able to control the network and submit blocks that are accepted as overriding previous state The thing is  this cannot happen in Solana   The leader schedule is computed from deterministic values that are stored on chain   Therefore  such an entity cannot retroactively alter the blockchain in a way that violates that previous leader schedule Furthermore  these are called block  chains  for a reason   An attacker would have to rewrite the entire chain from the first point of corruption all the way through the present epoch in order to be able to do this   But because they have to follow the PoH algorithm  they cannot generate corrupted blocks faster than the network can generate valid blocks   So they can never catch up   They ll be busy trying to create corrupted versions of blocks N   10  N   9  and N 8  while the network is already working on N   1  N   2  and N   3   Since PoH prevents the attacker from going faster than the current leader  the attacker can never catch up to the current leader Algorand appears to require that every key used for voting is used only once   That means that after every vote  the voter must re generate a new key and communicate this on blockchain   This extra data interleaved into the block chain would seem to work against their proposed benefit of using their scheme  which is reduced data size in the block chain In addition  the Algorand technique splits block production up into two steps  with different subgroups of nodes participating in each step   This is increased communication and latency as there is more message passing and two steps which must be serialized   This can never be as fast as Solana because of this  and probably will never be particularly fast overall They describe mechanisms for reducing data size needed to store their large voting signatures  which must include much information unique to each voter due to their two stage design which chooses random proposers voters for each block who then have to prove their identity  and talk about how this reduced data size is an advantage of their technique   while neglecting to factor in that if they didn t use this overly complex and slow method  they wouldn t need all that data to begin with Just an overall comment about Algorand   They seem to be trying to leverage their knowledge of esoteric mathematical nomenclature to produce inscrutable descriptions of overly complex algorithms   Then the resulting confusion is not understandable by anyone  which opens the door for them to make fantastic and unsubstantiated claims about what their techniques will achieve A lot of crypto tech seems to hinge on the confidence game of confusing everyone and then profiting from the hype you can generate out of fantastic claims that people will believe through their muddled haze of confusion   Algorand seems to be adding an extra helping of inscrutable mathematical notations into this formula Their network is currently running at about 4 TPS   Enough said Yes Thanks I have got it to work now wow fantastic     solana my favorite project and now solarians is also my favorite   when do we make our photos solarians Join the discord  there is people giving away some allocations every now and then Dang  the robot factory is closed haha  looks cool though you can switch over to xdai instead of eth and of course pay  lt 0 01  fee In addition  Solana consensus mechanisam is achieved by validators voting on the status of blockchain  so therefore the vast majority of the transaction is coming for continuously creating a consensus of the status of the blockchain This is siiiiick   Hells ya Dev belike  Of course tipping  1 or  2 with  30 gas fees make sense If he can t recall if it was  two beers and a coffee  or  two coffees and a beer  then it was probably two beers and the other 7 innovation 3 of them in my wallet  I just want to see what I gottt     anyways  I really think this is a promising project  especially as we see Solana absolutely killing it on charts rn Already accumulated 8 of it  Can t wait to change my profile picture to a robot  xD I heard he drank 64 beers and 1 coffee on a cross country flight while coming up with proof of history Also they re sacrificing security by sharding the network  apparently   just repeating what someone told me gt nice to know why SOL s price action is so amazing ATM  cause ATH every day now

would about 1000 watts  or 1kW The main net currently has 591 validators  data from solanabeach io   so we are talking 591 x 1   591kW for the main net  Even if we say each validator uses 2kW  we are still talking under 1200kW for the network Compare to other cryptocurrencies power draw here  https   xrpl org carbon calculator htmlBitcoin draws a whopping 57 09 BILLION kW Ethereum draws 2 57 BILLION kW Hope this helps   I m not an expert so if anyone sees any wrong info let me know Solana Spidey Sense Short answer  Serum produces an enormous number of transactions  much more than the trading volume  because the ENTIER orderbook of the dex is on chain  amp  x200B This is uniquely possible on Solana because it s layer 1 is fast cheap enough I m sure someone with a much deeper understanding of the tech can provide you with a more in depth answer Someone can correct me if I m wrong  but I believe that  Vote  is on chain consensus for the protocol WARNING    This is not a

and that avax is at 4 5k Do you have references for these numbers Raydium Bro you should visit ORCA so Yes Yes So the staking rewards are around 12  then do you have any LP farms in mind that are bigger then orca Media Network may allow for this type of content sharing  but I am not sure Scammer You can stake your Sol  you can do it with a wallet via a validatorhttps   docs solana com staking Have you set blind sign to yes on your ledger Solana app  You can find it in the settings section of the app on your Ledger Yes yep Solana IS the moon FRAud gt volumes on this  and how steady they have been in terms of buying to potentially identify if a whale is buying  If yes  I think I ll throw caution to the wind and double my positionBRB     No one asks why  Posted directly into a thread of a bunch of people asking  why     LOL yes No but I have been told several times by Solana devs that it is weeks away   They said that the code is basically done but they are doing a two week security audit and then it will be ready to release Each Solana validator uses about the same amount of energy as a mid range web server  There are about 570 or so validators at the moment   Honestly the amount of energy being used by Solana is so miniscule compared to a Proof of Work blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum that it s almost not worth talking about   It s not zero energy use  but it s on the order of the amount of energy used by something like wikipedia   Nobody even worries about how much energy wikipedia uses There is no built in carbon offsetting or anything like that   I suppose a validator could pay for its own carbon offsetting  maybe even pay for excess offsetting for a larger part of the network  and try to attract stake that way   But as far as I know  no validator is doing this yet Yes Yes Yes Thanks Yes Yes Heck yes If eth2 doesn t happen this year I can see solana exploding Bought at  1 30   10 and  23 I m thinking this is a long term hold  Fastest network out there  defo deserves a spot in the top 10 It really helps if you have a coffee and a beer before thinking about this stuff My opinion  POH  a working product  the decentralized exchange built on it which has an open full limit order book  and the scaling potential of this that is possible because of the speed and low transaction cost  the team  and finally the gradient color of the token  Have you tried using Solana and the others you mentioned  Which of the others works best That s about the biggest possible buy signal I can think of SOL s an odd one in my portfolio  The entire market dips and SOL goes to new ATH s  The entire market gets bullish and SOL dips I guess it s a good hedge  Lol Yes Is there a way to check volumes on this  and how steady they have been in terms of buying to potentially identify if a whale is buying  If yes  I think I ll throw caution to the wind and double my position I ve been taking on Moonlet but they re only returning 12    who is sharing the most staking rewards aka providing the highest return Anyone in the comments actually know wtf is going on  I like it and SOL is over 50  of my crypto holdings  I will HODL  after selling ETH at 12 and BTC at 14  this coin I put on an external wallet away from my greedy fingers  But still would be nice to know why SOL s price action is so amazing ATM  cause ATH every day now Solana does 90k tps  avalanche does 1 3million tps according to solanas calculations  It s faster and better in every way Actually I find this podcast is much more useful than the above one   Can Solana Seize Marketshare From Ethereum With Serum    Ep 193   YouTube  https   www youtube com watch v GU2_Q5yXJpk LOL awesome I really like this one    SOLdier here for sure Exodus wallet  moonlet  solflareExodus is where I m sending the newbs Solflare for the more advanced users Exodus is really easy to use I use binance right now  But it s often either sold out or there are only short term periods  like 15 days  available  ftx let s you stake also  but they are a bit less clear on the returns you can expect  I ve made about 1  in just over a month It s healthy to ask questions  in all honesty   except for blind faith in the team  I don t have much else  It s construct is healthy and there is a good team  Half of my crypto holdings are in SOL  let s see how it plays out What is best place to stake it Awesome  thank you for sharing Solana use PoL  Power of Love  as consensus  so no energy is needed and no negative environmental impact Just kidding  pinging  u ZantetsuLastBlade2 for better answer

ChainodeTech  https   t me ChainodeTech  Happy staking You should still consider SOL  Charts like this pick and choose to make certain things look good compared to others  There s also inaccuracies that other people have pointed out  I own SOL  and happily so  but we should still call out nonsense and misinformation Hey there  There are many strong points that make Solana unique compared to the already mentioned infrastructure projects  but in our opinion one of them is the most important  the number of active Validators in the network  making it one of the most  amp  truly decentralized projects out there There is quite a lot of misinformation in regards to the number of nodes in a network  because you very often hear  We have 2000 active nodes  and then all of a sudden  We have 3000 active nodes   but this does not mean anything if those nodes are owned by just a handful of validators  with each validator having 100 or 200 nodes  That is still very much a centralized network  Here  Solana is truly excelling  as it has over 500 active  amp  real Validators with many more considering to join the network  This level of involvement from the Validator community is something particular for Solana and once it reaches a snowball effect  we will have a glimpse into what true decentralization really is If you would like to discuss the Solana topic further or if you have any questions  we would be more than happy to welcome you and anyone interested to join our Telegram channel dedicated to our delegators and stakers but also to anyone who is passionate of learning more

some logical explanation Solana is 10 times faster right now isn t it  Why is available better STOP SPAMMING EVERY SUBREDDIT ON THE SITE WITH THE SAME MESSAGE How so  Genuinely asking new to considering SOL Anyone know how to buy in NY  I m about ready to set up a cold wallet and ask my friends from jersey to buy and send it to me Don t forget to stake it Lets just say a friend of a friend told me it s going way higher This price is low compared to where SOL will go  It will be at ETH levels eventually when other people realise  We got in early 我也遇到类似的问题 换  https   dex

was nice to have both him and Anatoly  founder of Solana  on together  podcast link  https   youtu be GU2_Q5yXJpk many thanks for your input   I will try to improve the article upon it The team just posted it today  This product has a lot of potential Thanks for the pointer  I ll go read more about Algorand step finance  https   step finance  is a wonderful product  and more features will be added very soon they just posted the tokenomics 2h a go   https   stepfinance medium com step tokenomics 83825705cd8  https   stepfinance medium com step tokenomics 83825705cd8  amp  x200B it is worth to take a look imo https   solanabeach io supply Good one  Please include this in the original answer you gave me then we can both delete our other comments in this thread  Thanks Is there an expected release day for stake pool functionality on solana Got some ada  14 50 just because it had a nice roi stacking it on binance  Never regretted it  if only i bought more But you asked in broad terms why people believe in the tech  you didn t ask for details of how it worked   And your leading question at the end about  just diversified for the sake of being diversified  kinda already describes where you are coming from  and I really don t think that there is any answer here that is likely to satisfy you This is awesome  thanks Its not that i didnt understand  rather the opposite  It seems i know more than whats written here  It lacks a lot of detail which i was expecting  I am not trying to criticise you  just letting u know Can you explain the exact token distribution  Or point to a source on where to read more  Also  what does the governance look like Dude you are on fire What words didn t you understand   What do you think was ambiguous Hmm   very ambiguous with lot of marketing words  but thanks I see my KIN coins on SolonaExporer but I don t see my KIN coins in my Solong wallet  What happened step finance is designed for solona Solana has unique tech that really works   It has been proven  on testnet  to be able to process tens of thousands of real  first class  on chain  consensus transactions per second   It has very low transaction fees   It has low latency   mainnet has been running for a year had has been stably performing more transactions per second than an other L1 crypto network This type of speed  latency  and low cost transactions enable applications that just don t work anywhere else Its design is unique and quite ingenious   It is highly optimized in ways that other blockchains just     aren t  I know an understand what is great about Solana tech   I have read about Cardano  in my opinion that one is a sham   Polkadot just promises everything but delivers essentially nothing and I don t see that changing anytime given what I understand about its design   Eth2 is based in flawed assumptions   It is likely to see some success just through momentum  but its sharding concept is going to be a big flop in my opinion   And it is perpetually not yet ready   The others I don t know much about  but I suspect that I will be just as disappointed when I read about them as I have been for every one that I ve spent time reading about    except Solana Solana has its problems for sure  mostly around token distribution  but I think its fundamental tech is going to be the long term winner because of what it can uniquely and provably do The calculator is exactly what I am looking for  Thank you very much  After calculation I am glad to find out that I am still making more money with the rewards and staking fee  Also it is much better than holding BTC   thank you so much You can use a calculator on  dailydefi  https   dailydefi org tools impermanent loss calculator   to get your expected impermanent loss It s quite lucrative to provide liquidity and farm on Raydium at the moment  so I wouldn t be surprised if the yield from farming rewards   the fees outweigh the IL  But of course  that largely depends on your entry price and the price deviations from the two tokens Fantastic  I just feel with most other cryptos the tech is here yet they are very limited    how has Solana s tech advanced so quickly You made the right decision  And you re going to LOVE the DEX s Solana  I use serum for trading and raydium to provide liquidity  Leveraged trading is in beta on mango markets and will soon have options trading with psyoptions Lol clearly not a lot   just keen to hear from the community as I m just weary of scams Lol no  Just recently bought into solana due to its incredible speed and low tx costs do u have a link showing that data https   spl solana com stake pool Avax much faster than soloana This gotta be a troll post lmaoooo Haven t got that issue and actually have been really liking Raydium a lot  trading works like a charm  swaps go through  farms and staking doing their thing  Orca is not bad at all but I feel Raydium is on another level  still they re both under development so I guess is a bit early to judge
2021-04-20,31.4762886,32.69721814,28.93257221,Sollet io also supports it but there are some caps  Also you need a tiny SOL balance to start with but you can acquire one with credit card on site like moonpay com Thanks  I forgot to mention that I ve done that thanks for the explanation   when you create a staking key  can you just send tokens to it after  or do you have to create a new key everytime Make sure to turn on the blind signing feature on your Nano LP token you get as a receipt when you provide liquidity to a pool  You can hand in the receipt to take out the corresponding share from the pool again later  Note that you will always receive a 50  50  split of the two sides of the pool  like if it is BTC USDC you will receive 50  of the value in BTC and 50  in USDC  If the relative value of the two token changed a lot you suffer  impermanent loss   Research this before staking Farming is a way where they can promote certain liquidity pools by providing additional reward for liquidity providers to those pools  You can deposit your receipt there to receive additional rewards  You will have to harvest those rewards periodically and re stake them to compound your interest Finally you can stake your RAY rewards themselves to earn more RAY RAY can be used for example to buy more other tokens again drom supported pairs  like RAY SOL to trade into Solana   or you can keep it as it increases in value the kore volume is processes through Raydium There is swap projectserum com which connects all compatible liquidity pool on Solana that are compatible with Serum  There is the central orderbook at dex projectserum com where each order actually runs on chain  Solana is the only blockchain I know that has a full fledged exchange with limit order support actually working on L1  Really impressive When using Serum  fee is 0 25  to liquidity pool  0 04  SRM buy back and burn and 0 01  for the UI   website initiating the swap Now  Raydium is just one of the liquidity pool connected to Serum  When you swap through their website instead of the Serum one  you only access their own pool  bypassing the extra 0 05  Serum fee and only paying 0 25   But  on swap projectserum com you also get all the liquidity outside of Raydium offered at the slightly higher 0 3  fee For Raydium orders  their 0 25  fee is split up into 0 22  that goes back into the LP and 0 03  that goes to RAY holders  They also allow you to stake LP token in farms to get more tokens and additional RAY for promoted pools When you hold SRM the fee should go down by certain percentage across all of Serum compatible exchanges including swaps on Raydium io  but I m not 100  sure actually if it also applies there or only when interacting with the LP on the Serum site  Note that for both Serum and Raydium  I am not aware of any available tool that allow you to export your staking history in a form that is useful for filing tax returns  While the full transaction history is available on the Solana explorer  it is super cumbersome to fetch   this is not like etherscan where it just shows you the actual operation being done but you have to click through each transaction and note the diffs in token balances and sort of guess what kind of operation that could have been  add remove lp  stake  harvest   On FTX you can also stake plain RAY in a custodial manner but they only offer a comprably low 20  APR  but they have clean reporting of staking rewards and re stake history available and there are programs on GitHub for automatic compounding  If you want a referral link for FTX feel free to DM me  it is not available to US persons In very simple terms  in addition to the fees that you get by providing liquidity to the pool  Raydium gives you a  bonus   that s why rewards are always in RAY  as an incentive to provide liquidity there and not in some other protocol  Therefore once you  stake  those LP tokens  you still will continue to receive the pool fees from trading  and in addition you will receive the farm rewards  in newly minted RAY We count on the High quality IQ of people not to fall in such SCAMs  Solana will always try its best to fight those scammers but we need the help of the community to help us fight them Before sending one single penny to anyone  any dApp built on Solana  or any other blockchain  quadripple check the links first

https   discord com invite pquxPsq   the best place to answer your questions Slashing is a common thing in Proof Of Staking  it s implemented mostly as a theoretical safety concern  No Slashing means validators may act as they want  even against the safety  security of the network   For now  Slashing in Solana isn t implemented yet    but it will be implmemented in the future to protect the safety of the network This is the basis for proof of stake  The validators have an economic incentive to behave properly  You have an incentive to choose a reputable validator Any way to win one  I cant afford one but love them I would also like to know this I don t think so I had this same issue   couldn t get metamask to reopen and confirm the transaction  However  in the sollet io web wallet  if you refresh and click on row of the token  metamask opens up and prompts you to confirm the transaction  whew Link Thanks for adding this info Hmmm I know about the COPE airdrop presale of what Technology debt is a serious issue  Especially in an environment where you can t change things easily during flight Inflation rate is dropping with time I hope people verify sales of new Solana tokens at their website  Scammers also impersonate Solana staff and send bogus offers to sell Sol Moonlet is an awesome app  I would add though that they don t actually restrict delegating to other validators  they just  heavily suggest  delegating to themselves via button highlighting UI placement etc There might even be some requirement terms of use etc  for developers that create software for users to interact with the blockchain  that if the app site allows for stake delegation  that they have to give every validator an opportunity to be seen selected  Otherwise it would be extremely anti competitive and would hurt overall decentralization No tbh there was some good information Hey  sorry to hear about this  unfortunately it s something that happens more often than it should  I think it might be worth to send the Binance customer support a message about this  as they could have the possibility to stop that wallet address from further transacting the tokens  The faster they act  the better  as once the money is taken out from the exchange it s way harder to stop the flow of tokens Alternatively  you could also report it to Uppsala Security  which is a blockchain based project that I am collaborating with as Growth Manager  We do not have a complete system in place for international cases  but by reporting the address  this will be registered as malicious in the blockchain based data hub and might flag other users or applications  exchanges  etc  that the address contains stolen coins so that they can also stop it  Please send an e mail at  info uppsalasecurity com  mailto info uppsalasecurity com  with a short description of this case  and we ll see what we can do for it In the meantime  you could take a look over the free browser extension that we released a while ago   UPPward by Sentinel Protocol  https   uppward sentinelprotocol io    Once installed  this usually automatically notifies you when you interact with a malicious wallet  website or social account  so that you can avoid these situations in the future Hope this helps and stay safe gt  blockchain    Web scale blockchain with speeds of 50k TPS   This subreddit isThe most recent one was COPE airdrop on the Solana blockchain Fair enough They re deploying the rendering code this week  even though mind you that the art is subject to changeFor now it s just a balance of 1 0000 in your wallet  Look out for the rendering code deployment announcement on discord Which airdrops is dude talking about Thanks for asking OP  I was wondering the same thing I got one in my  sollet io  https   sollet io  wallet  but how do i view it i feel dumb Yea  These things always end up taking longer than advertised  By the time ETH 2 0 is out fully  you will have several smart contract protocols that will already be past where they re just getting  I think the future is 2nd layer solutions that are blockchain agnostic and side chains  parachains as they re called on Polkadot   I don t know if we ll ever see a single blockchain that can handle tens of millions of transactions per second by itself while still keeping costs relatively manageable  Only a vast array of blockchains working together will achieve that So pricey  5 1Sol https   twitter com solstarterorg  https   twitter com solstarterorg lang en always look for updates from Solana website or official sources appreciate your insightful answer  what do you think of SOLs inflation rate  Do you think it ll be a downside price wise in the long run I believe in the vision of the team and the community behind it Besides that  I agree the future is uncertain Biggest  number of validators Not counting Bitcoin here as thats not relevant to the discussion here Eth has its own use cases and it is the biggest decentralized network ever created   or will be created    What criteria are you using to determine  biggest   and what gives you the impression that no other network will ever be bigger   That s an awfully confident thought for being at the beginning of such a long term innovation ETH is trash  I respect that they were trailblazers  Now holding on to market dominance by a thread  When you understand there are certain foundational issues that will never allow ETH to scale to 1b users  then you ll see why it is going to be a distant memory in 5 years The solana TPS can be scaled up significantly higher  50 000 was their testnet threshold but will adequate scale  the real TPS has nearly no limitation   Listen to the first two podcasts the team produced in 2019   The Solana Pod  https   podcasts apple com us podcast the solana podcast id1476353378 i 1000446769631 Highly recommended to truly understand what they are working with  When you listen to that and then you see what the Ecosystem has evolved to since then  it s hard not to be extremely bullish on this technology and how it will be applied in the future  Capable of much more than ETH2 TODAY and I personally believe it s in a league of its own Should have asked before you sent it  It s very easy to get scammed in the crypto space  Don t make that mistake again Seems like a scam imo Scam 1  there is no Eth Killer  Any chain claiming it is simply stupid 2  Eth has its own use cases and it is the biggest decentralized network ever created or will be created  With that  comes some challenges also  like getting people to agree on a future course of action  But when it comes to being used by Public domain  Eth will be the chain of choice  elections maybe 3  Solana has 50k TPS today and I believe it will evolve  The development and partnerships are going at a great pace and it will keep improving  It will carve out its own use cases 4  In the end  there will be multiple chains  with different use cases  domains  personal choices and narratives  But there are no Eth killers  Eth has a vision for going into the next century  not just next hype cycle 5  Think of Linux vs Microsoft OSX  Eth is like Linux  it will go through lot of slow things but will be the platform of choice for many  Windows OSX will have their own niche as well You can also stake using a hardware wallet  I use Solflare to do this  Also  Moonlet created an excellent app to stake SOL  The only catch is that you will delegate your stake to the Moonlet  Smart move from the guys at Moonlet  though TLDR  Its either going to go up or down from here Ok thanks Factory is open  you can freely buy new solarians if you didn t make it on whitelist   https   solarians click   https   solarians click Its comparing a product that is working vs a product in development  The strengths and weaknesses of ETH 2 0 will be more evident to us non engineers once it is in use and we can see for ourselves   I simply think that Solana is catching on right now  and by the time ETH 2 0 is launched it will have tons of steam and the best projects built on both will be mostly interoperable with each other  In my opinion the train has simply left the station Yeah its something that is completely the norm on centralized exchanges in both traditional finance and crypto  But most blockchains simply aren t fast enough or cheap enough to handle it  Serum has all the potential in the world but is very much in its infancy This is the type of tech I ve been waiting to see in crypto  Game changer Hey u Shmauzow  thank you very much for your trust  happy to have you in our staking crew   Please make sure to follow us on  Twitter  https   twitter com ChainodeTech  and  Telegram  https   t me ChainodeTech  in order to be up to date with our latest news and in case you would like to ask us any questions  Happy staking Even if they achieve 100 000 tps  the sharding approach for solving the scalability problem has several drawbacks  1  reduces censorship resistance  2  composability of different protocols dapps   Dex and landing protocol   3  Latency that can t compete with Solana  0 4  potential double spent problem   4  Sharding increase complexity for dapps development And yes  deliver of ETH 2 0 has a lot of uncertainty and probably some execution risk The test net on Solana can hit 200k TPS  and it s increasing with hardware upgrade  Moore s Law   both CPU  amp  GPU   So even though ETH 2 0 could hit 100k with perfect and on time execution  It still inferior to Solana in terms of scalability   And yes  we don t need ETH to fail for Solana to success  because Solana is just better in terms of scalability and is doing okay and improving decentralization halt power increased from 12 to 14 last few days Sam Bankman Fried is the guy that has the answer here at 8 min mark   This is why he chose solana and not ethereum to build serum on  https   youtu be hagdQ GIMEk Yes What wallet do you use  I m used to Metamask Thanks  this was really interesting to me    and in regards to what Analtoly said  makes sense  Ok so that actually sounds good then in terms of upgradability perhaps Another question   some of these transactions that Solana is doing  I wonder if any of them need to be private and so don t work too well  potentially  if broadcast on a public blockchain   I have no specific examples where I am certain that they need to not be public    but I wondered if in that stock exchange example you mentioned  if those orders are supposed to be  ideally  done behind the scenes    could it cause front running or something maybe  not sure   I m generally aware there are tons of different types of financial transaction  and many of them need to be private someone  or anonymous etc  various different level of  cloaking  part of the information sent depending on what it is     Therefore  does Solana have the ability to do this   i e  the flexibility to do this kind of thing as needed   Can you think of any examples where it is needed and Solana can cannot solve it Thank you   I may start a new thread to ask about the versatility of Solana s privacy features I remember in 2018 they were promising to improve the scaling issue   has anything happened since then  Not blaming anyone but i would be sceptical of their prognosis I think Anatoly means in the specific case of solana it s not a good measure of adoption  Solana is scalable in a very different way than other cryptos  it s speed is limited by the hardware  not software  The greater the bandwidth of each node  the faster the transactions get processed  In 2018 they measured tps to be 400k per second on high end hardware  on a single node though   Hardware is improving very rapidly  think about what s smart phone was a years ago compare to today  Moore s law is an emperical observation that the number of transistors in an integrated device doubles every two years  this is related to computing power   Solana is banking on this fact  in my opinion this is very clever and has unique advantages  But a consequence of this is that the node validators needs to be running high end rigs   5 10k in price  for the block chain to be fast  I don t know what the situation is now but i suspect there are still lots of slower validators delaying the entire network  Solana is still very new  The main point is that there is lots of room for improvement and importantly it s a simply solvable problem  just get better hardware  The approach eth  and similar layer 2 solutions  is trying to do scale up it s tps is with sharding  it s entirely not clear that it will work  It s somewhat of an more esoterical problem and is a far  more difficult to solve  In the case of solana the solution is simple  buy better hardware Having said all that  i don t know if Solana wants to works like nasdaq  Visa claims to process 65k tps  and i think that s a much better avenue for this technology  as a form of instant payment but without some central mediator   But if it developers enough then no reason to also run a huge exchange on it I delegate to you guys on SOL and AKT 100 000 TPS is not eth2 0  First they will get 1600TPS   then  2 years later they will expand to 100 000 TPSX64 sharding first in 2022 and then x1024 sharding in 2023 24  1600 TPS will be enough in 1 year   No way  Moreover  the latency of Solana is much faster  it s 0 4 seconds per block  which gives much more value for many use cases  especially in DeFi This is all expecting Ethereum reaching it s milestones without significant delays  Such delays are commonplace in ETH roadmap Unless that you think that PoH is not real decentralization  I think that it is  or is risky somehow  I m not so expert in this area   Solana is the most solid alternative  More than Polkadot or Cardano  I hold  both of them  but I believe more in Solana Edit typos yeah i curently LP on radium thanks to the suggestions   29th is the IDO date right  Thats why i bought 20 RAY extra yeah i curently LP on radium thanks to the suggestions To me it s pretty basic  there s simply no way  even if Eth is 100   successful with their upgrade  that their 100 000 TPS will be enough for all the demand in the market  Think of how few that are really using DeFi today  how will things look when millions  tens of millions or hundreds of millions are using this stuff around the world  And then you have other usecases like NFTs  decentralized social media and whatever else you think is realistic  However I twist and turn it  there will be a need for more than Ethereum in the market I think a flaw that many have when evaluating Solana s chance for success is that they fool themselves into thinking that Ethereum somehow needs to fail for it to continue growing  I don t think that s the case at all Plus you need to add into the equation that Ethereum 2 0 still hasn t shipped  they are still struggling with massive fees and low TPS  And it s not like the current capacity of the Solana network is maxed out either  it will be able to do even more TPS in the future  Things are looking bright imo Agreed   Some of capacity is taken up basically  but it is still the leader in the field Interesting  thanks  I didn t know the Nasdaq had number TPS   I would actually disagree that transactions are a poor measurement of value  I use them as an essential valuation metric for blockchains and try to find out what they are One question   isn t Solana s TPS 50k per second and Nasdaq is still only 1 stock exchange in which case it is still not enough    Or will it be able to scale more in the future Ok  so the ability to place limit orders is an advance of putting all the transactions on chain   Ok  sounds like a feature  thanks Hi Thanks for the replies  but you have completely misunderstood my post   I said that it is good that it shows it can handle a large number of transactions   However  that benefit is partially undermined if its apps actually   need   to all be put on there like that  unlike all the other blockchains I have ever researched as this uses up that extra TPS which is inefficient  unless there is some benefit I am not aware of which I have asked   presumably it is probably just a good thing that it can handle so much and these are unusual examples that end up appearing on the network The real issue I am highlighting here is that people who buy in might get a false impression if they think that tons of transactions that are meaningless in terms of evaluation by usual metrics are relevant   Clearly this is not deceitful as it is how the network works  I m just saying it is still very misleading and pointing out  in a way that may be helpful to anyone here in case they had not noticed  that Solana actually has a tiny number of users compared to what its block explorer implies Hi there  Yes  it is possible to stake SOL tokens while having them on a hardware wallet  like for example Ledger  We actually released some staking

it s crypto  so impossible to predict is right on  I m big on Sol only cause I ve been using the dexes and other tools lately and can see the value in it so far at least just join the discord  and find the presale form to get whitelist  It s not too late  plenty of slot there How do we get access  Is it too late now Thanks That the project that Raydium s team recommend can someone tell me how to claim these Great answer  Thank you Or at least  that would be years into the future making it almost impossible to predict right If you re into programming  amp  developing  better head to  Solana Discord  https   discord com invite pquxPsq   the best place to ask  how to do it on Solana     Solible     https   solible com   list  https   solible com   list   Phantom   for example is trying to achieve that too  https   twitter com phantom status 1382014430188167171 s 19  https   twitter com phantom status 1382014430188167171 s 19 Can I have a link with numbers I do not see a single other person making these claims and it is hard to believe millions of people are fooled right now without verifiable math  That dude is also the CEO of AVAX right Not saying that he is not credible just that these claims are absurd when ETH with 15 tps is 80 times the size of AVAX with a supposed working 1 3 million tps  higher than propsed ETH 2 0 Yes go on Twitter look up emin gun sirer  he explains if they calculated like solana Avax hits 1 3m tps Or like rng What does generative mean here exactly  Like cellular automata but onchain Nice gt   you can simply leave all your eth as is and instead just use an xdai faucet to obtain 0 001 xdai and at that point contribute without needing to eat any gas fees at all  quite literally at 0 cost  but the tradeoff is u wont have funds to tip burn withYou still need to pay gas fees to move to xDai right  That fee is still too much for majority of normies It is and it s not in the same time I receive white list and 2 of it got buy from other members allocation link Hi Guys  I really need help here and I want to swap my SOL TOKENS  I did not do an swaps because I was sick  I just checked and it looks like there was a swap  Do I have to do the swap  How do I do it   Pls help Thanks in advance Raydium  of course  Plus Raydium itself has a nice potential to grow  The market cap is low now  And sign up for Raydium on Telegram  They have admin who answers very quickly Nah random  but you can look at  comparable  projects and what they re worth   focus on market cap to see if that much  value  can be accrued Ie at  100 per SOL  with 489 million that would be  49 billion in total market cap  which is a big jump from where we are and   not impossible  given where DOGE is Yup looking forward to it I ll give you the real answer to your question  Most predictions are wrong and are based on insufficient or non existent evidence  Should SOL go up  Probably  it is just the beginning and it offers some real utility  Is there a way to know where it will be next week  No  not really  Not only are technical analyses based on regulated centralized systems of exchange  but Solana is a new asset  relatively speaking  thus most analyses aren t properly suited to analyze its trajectory in the near future Thank you You ll probably sell them for  1 billion in ten years and Oprah will interview you on national TV Have been loving Raydium a lot lately  swaps go through just fine  farming has decent APRs  fusion also is great and staking works like a charm   can t go wrong in there  They re also about to release their IDO platform so things are really moving fast with these guys would other artists be able to replicate your minting method  asking for a friend  it s me I m the friend     XD On binance  i tried to share screenshot on here  check please  Im not good at reading charts yet or msg me I think there are a few of each variant available

general FUD is for a given project   It s a lot harder to find a project s self reflective and self assessment of real challenges I was looking for insight regarding what knowledgeable devs  or team members see as real current challenges for Solana  not including the mass adoption issue   that is  what are the issues and challenges that are currently being wrestled with and battled out  and what are seen as on going future challenges  Relatedly  what is the landscape of plans to try to tackle those challenges I m going to keep searching for such answers  I m sure there s a talk  article  or video out there somewhere that addresses such things in some capacity  although I ve searched quite extensively for the time being   but have a lot to learn There are many scams on Discord and Twitter They are promising token airdrops and open presale after that  It is better to avoid this kind of presale IDO in Raydium is coming out  and there are new projects called Solstarter to facilitate this kind of sale  it will be helpful to filter this kind of scams I think either I did not adequately convey my questions properly and or you misconstrued the above questions to be something they were not intended to be as my searching of the forum prior along with the links you provided didn t necessarily address the core of what I thought my questions conveyed Funny thing is before posting my question I did search the forum and numerous other places  youtube  other forums  the solana website  etc  and previously read many of the posts that you linked while in search of answers I m beyond the stage of  What makes Solana Unique   or  What makes the Consensus algorithm unique  type of questions  as well as the more elementary questions that some even noobier noobs than me might ask such

time matters just as much as throughput   The latency of the products developed will be able to do fundamentally different tech with a block time that is 20x faster   Imagine driving a car with a 400ms time  now imagine driving a car down the street with a 10s block time   One of this is feasible  and the other isn t Im pretty sure you can get them alreadySolarians click Thanks for the in

Lol your comparing somthing that exists to somthing that does not and probably wont for years and when its does you have no idea ehat the acutely speed will be in reality yea  I ve seen them argue back fourth about this all time   I m unable to confirm from code point view which is right   but I wouldn t say either one can conclusively confirm correct except the projects that chose SOL maybe the real true statement since they tested all other high potential blockchain they could ve built onwhat s avax biggest project so far What operating system are you using  Windows    NanoX  is still

have been unable to find one  ill need to understand how to develop smart contracts on solana first to see what this would look like EDIT  if anyone can help me understand the differences that would be helpful I have the same issue They said that they re soon announcing other means to get one Solarian  So stay tuned on discord for any announcement I have some allocations to give Am very hopeful with with Solana  Although I don t have much but it s still a good future to overtake eth potential You re still getting that error even after    blind signing   is turned ON Not sure about that  but LP fees are based on volume using that pool  Each swap pays into the fees  So I guess those advertised numbers are just the farming rewards  Also  APR numbers usually depend on current liquidity so may go down if more people get attracted  And not sure if it also includes assumption of compounding each day or if the number is without compounding  Essentially  in any case  what you get is probably less than the number  but I haven t checked it in depth yet  Maybe best to look up the Raydium discord and ask there  I m confident they can answer your questions more authoritatively than me guessing things Thank you for the explanation u etan1  I have on additional question Is the APR advertised in the farm page the total APR from LP fees   RAY farming or is that APR meant only for farming You create a   Stake Account    where you SOL should be locked into  That   stake Account   allow you to delegate to any validator of your choice  Your SOL Stake will go through what is called     WarmUp     where it gets ready to get into the network so you start earning reward out of your Stake Your Stake will enter the network by the beginning of the new   Epoch    an Epoch is around 3

like I was wrong lol  But ya  I think we re on the same page here Oops  I had the wrong word phrasing that conveyed the wrong point  I agree with you From all the messaging I ve heard from Solana devs and core team I haven t gotten the maxi vibe at all  except maybe the Sharding thing but that s just pointing out what Solana devs honestly feel makes the project superior than other solutions which is perfectly fine    I should ve said and intended to say    gt And it s good to know that the leaders of Solana aren t maxis    the non maxi approach is the impression I got from their various talks   I mistakenly had the wrong phrasing  my bad  when I said    And it s good to know that the leaders of Solana aren t maxis and I got that impression from their various talks View in your timezone

Yakovenko about some of SOLANA s key innovations that allow it to provide incredibly fast and  cheap operations including   Proof of History  Tower Byzantine Fault ToleranceBy the end of this conversation you ll have a good understanding of this technology and how to get involved too   Duration  30min    Hosted by Blockmatics      https   blockmatics io Hi I don t know the answer to your question but I posted your question on the Project Serum Discord and will let you know here if I get an answer Why so bearish check capitalization  for me it wanted all letters undercase  Make sure there are no unnecessary spaces anywhere as well I m not sure if you figured it out or not  but i had the same problem  For me the issue was capitalization  I was capitalizing the beginning of each word  When i did lowercase it let me restore 900    1300 Try this out  ensure blind  signing is on   try that with any other browser other than FireFox please  Chrome  Brave      1  Open Solana app on ledger2  Access wallet on solflare by choosing path3  Then choosing address I agree with using chrome  I had the same error in other browser yea i updated and checked my  crypto com  https   crypto com  app    still not able to find SOL anywhere  i am in the US though I think the main reason why people want to farm SOL RAY over UDST RAY because they value the coins over USDT  Even USDT RAY have more APR    You have to think that if you put 100 RAY and 1000 USDT to farm  you pretty much lock down only 100 RAY and wait for it to grow  but USDT value going to stay the same  In other hand if you farm 100 RAY and 28 SOL you get 85  APR and your coin value keep growing  if they do  mostly yes   This is only my opinion and other people might dissagree Lol  yea I sold most of my Alts for SOL   This is the Eth killer gt And it s good to know that the leaders of Solana aren t maxis and I got that impression from their various talks They may come across that way because they re pretty blunt in their assessment of other projects and where they think their weaknesses are  and how Solana can address them   but at the same time they are also pragmatic enough to understand that they will need to also live alongside them  at least at current  and are putting a lot of effort into interoperability At least that s my take What browser did you use  Have you tried other browsers  amp  still getting the same error Yes  thanks for helping anyways The wallet is  sollet io  https   sollet io   I unlock it with seed words password  and get the screen with main balance   The problem is  the balance is constantly loading and not showing me either my wallet address nor balance  Also  I cant add any other coin because of the error   failed to get recent blockhash  TypeError  Failed to fetch   amp  x200B This only happens if I select Mainnet Beta  when devnet or testnet servers are selected  I can see my wallet address even thou the balance is still 0  which is not correct  amp  x200B  screenshot  http   prntscr com 11tavk0 Thank you for this excellent explanation   That helps clear up my question and some others I had I m taking about SPL tokens if there is any word about e g  kin being listed alongside sol https   twitter com solana status 1384616321569148930  https   twitter com solana status 1384616321569148930  https   solana com lisbon  https   solana com lisbon Just move your sol to raydium and make the swap there I follow way too many of those pepe mfers What about SPL tokens I ended up getting one  No laser eyes but he s a good bot https   twitter com solana status 1384616321569148930  https   twitter com solana status 1384616321569148930 Stealthex io has limitless swaps from ethereum to solana  It isn t quite a decentralized exchange but there is no kyc and no account needed Thanks Exodus is great  11 42  staking is unbelievable Yes  a majority of the sub uses the moonlet app  so might be bypassing something  Look around the app I only see three cryptos supported by Moonlet   Eth  Zil  Near   Am I missing something hello  i am same situatinon   i want to cancel  SPL   gt  ERC20 send transaction i canceld transaction via Metamask  but  when i connect sollet always Metamask ask me  approve send transaction is there any solution Thanks for the good advice but i need to be able to buy and withdraw  this just says deposit and withdraw  or am i missing something Yeah I see that   I think the most exciting aspect of crypto is when it can t be stolen You mean a key  Exodus yes  moonlet solflare the key will be the ledger FYI  if you want to move your ETH to FTX you can send it from there directly to a Solana wallet and avoid further Ethereum network fees  Pretty sure that is cheaper than sending directly to Sollet Will it give me cryptogram as well Thank you will do No you can t use it with ledger but moonlet is an iPhone app that does allow you Can you please add more details What wallet are you opening  Sollet  SolFalre     you re checking your SOL address in  Solanabeach io  https   Solanabeach io  or maybe  https   explorer solana com  https   explorer solana com Ok you have my attention Staking reward is the incentive https   youtu be GRQLMMX_3QE You are about to have a crypto orgasm I m not familiar with exodus wallet   Can I use with Ledger Head To SolFlare Telegram Support Group So They Gave You The Best Answer For that    SolFlare   https   t me SolFlare _Wallet  https   t me SolFlare_Wallet I m unsure on this one but why not just stake with exodus wallet  It s so much easier How do they incentivize nodes to be honest HelloThe best place to get what you re looking for is in Solana Discord  there are already bunch of them who participated in the last 2 Hackathons     Solana Discord     https   discord com invite pquxPsq  https   discord com invite pquxPsq Good luck Finally Now i got your point Someone had your same question in Solana Discord  gt  2 quetsions about stake accounts      gt    gt   1    Let s say I create a stake account  add 1000 SOL to it  and delegate that  Then I want to add another 1000 SOL  Can I transfer those funds into the stake account  and that 1000 will start warming     gt    gt   2    Let s say I change my mind and want to withdraw some amount from my stake account  Can I withdraw while I have funds warming  In the scenario in question one  I have 1000 effective stake  and 1000 activating stake  Could I withdraw any of the effective stake  or do I need to wait for the warmup period to be complete   amp  here was the answer from Trent   Solana Team     1    You can t increase the delegation of a stake account that s not fully deactivated   Depositing into an account in any other state is just extra SOL that you can     stake withdraw  2    No  You can create a second stake account with the same delegate and authorities   Wait for it to warm up and receive it s first epoch s rewards   Then     stake mergeit into the first account 2  You can wait for the account to fully warm up       stake splitthe portion you wish to withdraw into a second account       deactivate stakethe second account   Wait for it to cooldown   Then     withdraw stakeits

829931245194313758 It s all good  It s no worries  I easily could ve misread some of your comments a bit and vice versa And it s good to know that the leaders of Solana aren t maxis and I got that impression from their various talks Yeah  I agree that more recent happenings are definitely most relevant and meaningful for the current landscape of things  Though previous year challenges  controversies  and successes often have a great deal of relevance in shaping the current landscape  sentiment  and organizational health of a lot of projects  i e   EOS  Tezos  IOTA   But you re definitely right though the more recent matters most From discussions on discord and the messages on reddit  it seems the Solana core team plans to provide a detailed Roadmap in the near future  as well as disseminate a  state of things  video discussing the roadmap and history which may include various elements addressing my questions like  what are current challenges and solutions to the challenges  So  that has the potential to be something meaningful and valuable that can potentially be a  one stop shop  resource video that can help orient people newer to the cryptospace like myself to the current happenings with Solana Hopefully it is still in the works and will be something I ll look forward to seeing for sure sol must solve this  its so silly  thanks mate  ur the best I don t believe in the ETH killer narrative either   But I also don t believe in the ETH maximalist narrative of  no other token will ever grow larger than it    The reality is because of cross chain compatibility the decent tokens will stay around and just change underlying elements to make it more friendly to users by becoming interoperable   Whatever limitations of each coin will mean other coins get used for that type of tech required   In this case  fast block times is not something you d use ETH for Sollet bro Firstly  I wasn t trying to criticize so I didn t mean for it to come off that way  I completely understand where you are coming from regarding maxi s and simply wanted to point out that the leaders of Solana don t promote it  That doesn t mean you won t come across maximalists though As far as the years of information  I guess I just disagree that you need to concern yourself with anything that happen prior to 2020  to understand the project   outside from reading the whitepaper u zantetsulastblade2 is going to lay another banger in here just watch next Gemini Kraken Coinbase This is a great response because it points me to the fact that there may have been a recent webinar zoom that I can find that might answer some of my questions and give me a better understanding of current challenges and current solutions Thank youl Much respect  And thanks a lot This is exactly the type of experienced Solanaian response I was hoping to add to my evolving understanding of current challenges and solutions for the project Thanks for thoughtfully addressing some of my questions and not just dismissing or misreading them It gives me a chance to follow up on things like Arweave integration amongst other potential challenges  thereby  expanding my perspective on the nature of the project I don t recommend buying presale allocation  because you could end up paying higher price than public sales No  2sol is for presale whitelist allocation  If you buy one of those allocation  you will still need to pay 1  12sol to mint the NFT If after all of your research you have decided that Solana  has existed for many years  you may want to just start over  Watch some YouTube videos and listen to some podcasts specifically of Anatoly talking about Solana and SBF talking about Serum for questions 1  amp  2  Solana from the very top does not promote maximalism and in fact its quite the opposite  They believe the success of other blockchains and projects only help them  The DEFI projects built on Solana want to be as interoperable as possible with other projects I recommend you try using Solana and the other chains you are researching  its a much faster way to get a feel for how something works  As always remember that when looking at price action  fundamentals and accomplishments are not very important in the short term  When the market goes into its next long bear market so will every project  But the longer the timeframe the more it starts to matter 1 59 is the LP tokens  you will get return based on the amount of staked tokens   150 Avalanche does just fine without slashing  and has no plan to implement one If you think it through   slashing makes no sense  If the attack doesn t succeed  then nothing happened  no need to punish anyone  If attack succeeds  well  the attacker then owns the network  and can use slashing mechanism against others As a matter of fact  if you look at any of the slashing events that happened so far  on ETH2 0   all stake that was slashed was from people either making a mistake  misconfiguration   or from network outages  In no case that I have seen so far has someone malicious been punished  Quite the contrary  victims have always been either good intentioned or faulty through no wrongdoing of their own  network issues No  it is not  There are PoS networks that don t have slashing and they work just fine hmmm  I ll try to ask it again in a different way  And i m using SolFlare in a month from now  can I add new SOL tokens that I purchased to the current Stake address  OR do I have to create a new stake key and delegate my newly purchased tokens to that new key I attended a webinar zoom that was open to public last week I think it was  I m still learning  but was impressed with the hackathons sessions they hosted to build on that development and integration  Just felt like there was a foundation here to build on  we ll see  As mentioned I m still learning how all these uses will drive the market  so love seeing it discussed I am fully invested in Solana ecosystem and its a big big part of my portfolio  But I am just stating what is out there  I dont believe in Eth killer narrative  Every token should just focus on its own niche As I said before  being an open source  decentralised network has its pros and cons  and in the end it will keep moving and being adopted by public domain and major corporations  I will end my point here maybe double check if the 1 59 is the LP It will be very interesting i guess  5 day events and focused on Solana  and maybe projects built on it Good recovery  I appreciate you for taking the time to put this together Yep https   discordapp com invite pquxPsq I suggest you add Raydium Telegram  and ask over there  It s by Admin  Good n fast response Looking forward to this  Hopefully the overall traveling situation will be much better than now Is SOL staked auto compounding after each reward payout on moonlet Happy for the Lisbon choice  D  although I live in London
2021-04-22,32.68343072,40.97186247,31.60069045,Because people have heard about it It took a long time for me to get verified too  I gave up hope then suddenly at 11PM on a Saturday I had access  I want to say it took 22 days  I applied right before the DOGE hype got much louder  late January   Just hang in there until you get approved  Binance is good and trustworthy platform  amp  x200B I was impatient at first too  but it s best to try to keep your emotions out of your investing  The lag may be a blessing if it stops you from buying right before a major dip  Also  if you stick with Binance  I suggest getting some BNB to save on fees  Best of luck to you What will be the use of Solana in the future   Is the purpose to make it similar to fiat  I have  A bit bought  but I want to understand more before buying more To the moon Bought a bunch one smooth week ago  Best crypto purchase yet Why is pumping dude Heard it dipped for a few minutes did anyone notice same here bro  i waited so long to buy because of the hassle but finally made the jump with ftx this week I love how measured and thoughtful the hype posts in this sub are Just call me the SOLman i d be interesting in know the definite answer on this as well No reason to wait till then  Download blockfolio and buy it today if you want  Also just for your information  Coinbase mobile app is a bit misleading to the retail investor They charge between 1 10  fee on every transaction depending on how much you buy  A  25 purchase has about a 7  Coinbase fee   1 50   Coinbase Mobile app  1 10 Coinbase pro   5 Blockfolio   1  and you get a free crypto with every purchase over  10  I recently switched and don t plan on ever using Coinbase again  this is not financial advice just my personal opinion Uphold Solana looks really strong right now  I remember researching it about 6 months ago and thinking it only had two weaknesses  an unproven POH protocol and a large dev supply tokenomics Since then  no security issues and the price has held despite the huge dump of coins from January So what is there to complain about  TXs are cheap and fast  Staking is easy and has been very profitable  And the ecosystem is growing rapidly  Very excited but when will coinbase list SOL   I really wanna buy it Sure  DM me You want a referral code for fee discount Man that sucks  I hope you figure this out soon  All those awesome cheap sols are selling out fast Will try FTX Not available for US citizens Okex At this point  idek  But we can prob assume it will do at least what Neo  Dot  and other chains end up doing  Though I think it might blow up higher eventually  If bull run doesn t end  I m thinkin 100  end of year Wont approve me  Stuck in the queue solarians click walletIt s a test version tho And it just about 2 weeks  My only regret is I didn t have much loose funds to throw at it  What price level do you see SOL getting to Dude literally  No hype yet either  Once people start hearing about this it ll go bazerk Love when the rest of my portfolio is microscopic on this infographic haha EOS has hundreds of block producer candidates  It lost some BPs but it is less centralized than ETH by certain standards  Sol is a good buy    functionality has little to do with price   see eth for proof Sucks I can t get Solana through Kraken   Wanted to buy like 3 weeks ago Binance Earn Locked Staking Select the 15 day option Just checked into it  it s only a 4  gain if you hold for 15 days   not worth it for such an increase in volume Think people just realise it s potential Yes agreed  Think breaking  10 is a fair first move  Then we can set our sights on cardano How do I avail of this on binance Yep FTX No   when btc first dipped sol dipped to  25 levels  it recovered very quickly and pumped  You have to be quick Yep  Everything is falling but Solana stays strong  That s impressive  I know what coin to really invest in It s never too late  In fact we are extremely early bitcoin went from 65k to 50k earlier this week and in that timeframe Solana hit an ATH  It has jiggled around and slipped back again today to 51 8k and Solana          hit another ATH I guess it would have to be a very big shit and right in the centre of the bed Binance us Ftx I m waiting for the  20 zone personally but if it doesn t go back there  can t be a bad thing If it dips I ll just accumulate more Blockfolio See how this aged That s true as far as the plumbing goes  but the UI matters too  I prefer Raydium myself though  Much better UI IMO Doesn t matter what dex you use they all route through serums order book it will dip again especially if BTC suddenly shits the bed   I d buy around the  30 zone Serum Thank you Solana  My best investment so far There will always be dips along the way  but for me the only thing that matters is the long run and that s looking great Only resistance that got tested properly was  30 Up and down always Ada will grab Eth share  but it moves slow and steady  Solana is going to shred Eth to pieces Yeah seems like that s temporary for them to raise capital  but was hoping they would have gone with SPL from the start I got this image from https   www coinparticle com There s the archivers separated from the validators to store the history and also validators charge a storage rent to avoid memory use free loading  However I m not sure how much of the history you need to bootstrap a validator Indeed If you believe ETH will x3 from here  you would love Sol price by then Binance The only answer thus far is   conditional orders are difficult on the blockchain    But I was told that the question has been relayed to a dev and that more info is forthcoming  I will update here when it is available no problem  to the moon we go Thanks Yeah I am not going with Binance way too many things  red flags  going on there for me to feel comfortable buying  supporting them gt will convert themLike another user said  FTX US automatically converts USDC to the correct format of the wallet its sending to  Unfortunately binance doesn t do this yet  But if you send USDC from binance to  ftx us  https   ftx us  you will not have to convert it  You can then send it to any SPL address without issue and you will have SPL USDC Lol  Can you use the desktop version  Just click the link I posted in my previous message and it will take you you the US version of FTX where you can buy  SOL  you can also use a VPN like Mullvad to buy from the non US version of FTX Can t figure out how to post a screenshot on here but I downloaded the FTX app and it s prohibited to access their service in the United States This is incredible  I can only imagine what the next 6 months has in store  Fusion reactors engage looks to be dead on Hey do you guys remember when I told you it would hit  43 by Friday  Well um its gonna happen still Binance US has bad ratings    and Binance tried to eliminate all Americans from holding anything on their platform last year   giving americans 90 days to move all their holdings  Why is Malta AntiAmerican  LOL As an American wheredo i buy this crypto  Cant find it on any platform Me too  it s on a tear right now I suspect this rise my be because Binance just offered 15 day locked staking at 34 49  so I guess there was a bit of interest there to buy up Solana I think  444 is a realistic target  amp  that s about 40  of ETH today s market cap  https   twitter com RY _ChimaGun status 1381882584737538048  https   twitter com RY_ChimaGun status 1381882584737538048 I m in the exact same position as you Gregorypeckham  NY resident with zero access to Sol thru an exchange  DEX is the only option but in order to set up Sollet and get access to Serum i need some SOL first     going around in circles  Wondering if you would pay it fwd and help out by sending whatever the minimum amount of SOL  0 001   to this address 6BsxGhyWjwNitWSFYpfoQnF2qeavSzRbP8PADbzKXnkLnot a scam  like you  just trying to get started here Updated  thank you I think the discord link here need to be updated to this one     https   discord com invite 6zQDYBde3w  https   discord com invite 6zQDYBde3w I thought that was ADA LOL   Wish I had SOL much earlier I m getting an  invalid invite  for discord It s good to have more wallet choice  thumbs up for that    But I wouldn t recommend staking in P2Pvalidator though  they are currently top 4 in cumulative stake  we need to stake on other validator for a much decentralize network My recommendation is u ZantetsuLastBlade2 validator  https   solanabeach io validator BLADE1qNA1uNjRgER6DtUFf7FU3c1TWLLdpPeEcKatZ2  https   solanabeach io validator BLADE1qNA1uNjRgER6DtUFf7FU3c1TWLLdpPeEcKatZ2 ftx us  https   ftx us   Sol is built by the FTX team After looking for Eth alternatives for years  I ve landed on Solana being where I ll build my killer dapp  Solana has the highest tps  cheapest tps  best future scalability story  while still remaining decentralized  amp  permissionless  It really doesn t get better than this  Just wish I had taken Solana more seriously earlier on and went beyond some of the fud I saw coming from other communities Team belike   Solana people can afford to buy expensive token because they paying cheap transaction fees   lol  jk To contribute or play around with it  check it out here  https   github com p2p org p2p wallet web yep you re right yeah sorry I worked that out for myself just by looking at my balances a while after I commented that  2 epochs or 4 days is correct yes Hmm  CRWNY token will be released as ERC20 first Love seeing progress like this  reinforces investments   Great job does FTX accept BSC tokens  I think that for USDC you can only send ERC 20 sure  never hoped to do that for free  I know there are always fees to pay    just wanted to know if there is a bridge to pass directly from USDC on BSC to USDC on Solanaotherwise I will convert them to SOL  transfer to an exchange  withdraw to a Solana wallet  then swap the into USDC    it looks pretty complicated  and maybe expensive If you transfer your USDC to a coinbase wallet  you can covert crypto without fees  There is a transfer fee from binance to an outside wallet and vice versa  Selling any crypto  there is a fee is  50 per hundred on binance and a lot higher on coinbase  There isn t a way to do it for free  There is always a transfer and a buy sell fee  You should research what the most efficient or lowest fee path will be  but it s never free There are multiple ways to go about this  but one way is to transfer USDC to FTX or  FTX us  https   FTX us  and then send it from there as an SPL token into your wallet  More people  especially here   should be using FTX I don t pretend to  know  about these things  but when you have coins like Cardano and Polkadot  who don t even have smart contract support yet  out there with  30  40B market caps  anything is possible with my shitty knowledge of math  with our current supply of 250M  circ  not total  we d have to reach 77BN market cap to just reach the price of 300   I sure hope we achieve astronomical numbers but we should stay with our feet on the ground Your balance will increase gradually After staking it takes a few days to start earning  I don t remember but I think it s 4 days how can you see your staking rewards  or does it gradually add to your Solana total balance Improve my web browsing experience and give me rewards  Sounds really cool  Looking forward to test driving this Yes it work I use and works fine New ATH I seriously love this project I thik this price in 2023  In this year i hope 200 300 Solana Staking in Exodus does not work I think  1 000 so I m accumulating 100 SOL by August What are the chefs hat and candy wrapper at the bottom right  I know the rest just haven t seen those So many good projects    So little liquid capital both Chrome and Firefox  doesn t work on both What does any of this stuff do They just deleted my comment because I posted a chart showing their crypto is gradually losing all of its gains from over 6 months and Binances coin is owning them   I don t think they liked it I have heard two statements on this  one  that only your stake rewards for the epoch would be at risk  not your original stake  and two  that stake itself would be at risk I am not sure which would be implemented if when slashing is implemented You can buy through Binance us Awesome  thanks for sharing I think you can t for now  you can go write them a email and request though This didn t age well when can we buy in the US via crypto com this blows  ha by the time we get a chance to buy its gunna be  100 at this rate Binance didn t implement the SPL yet  so careful  Follow the Solana official news  amp  always try with small amount in things like that if you re not 100  sure Remember to always ask in here or in  Solana Telegram  https   t me solana    Discord  https   discord com invite pquxPsq  about anything you have in mind so you don t loose your assets Slashing is not implemented   automated yet  But in the future if a validator cause a safety violation the stakes delegated to it are at risk of being slashed how can we view the NFTs I am having a similar issue at the moment  Sold 30 SOL for USDT on the DEX while connected to my SolFlare Wallet  linked to my Ledger  and after the sale went through I see 30 unsettled SOL  and 0 USDT  despite selling SOL for DOT   Even worse  the 30 SOL are now in  Unsettled  status and when I click settle the transaction fails  Goes through on Ledger  after allowing blind sign  but then SolFlare DEX returns the following error  Error settling fundsTransaction failed  Instruction  InitializeAccount  amp  x200B So yeah  selling 30 SOL for    1000 USDT leaves 30 unsettled SOL and 0 USDT and I can t move past this point  Any help greatly appreciated  Tried their Telegram channel and only response is from scammers that are asking to create new Trust Wallet and send them private keys after transferring 1 ETH There is no bridge yet  so you have do what u Almost_Me said   Sending back to binance  buy sol  send to sol wallet  and exchange sol to USDC SPL on serum dex or raydium swap I ve never sent anything from bsc to solana  I d suggest sending whatever you re about to swap back to binance com or binance us and exchanging it for SOL  then send it to your wallet  If I m not mistaken  the token needs to be SPL native so I wouldn t take any chances on bsc at the moment  Again  I m a bsc noob so maybe someone else could clarify Damn  this is some r MurderedByWords level criticism of Algorand  Thanks for the explanation That is huge   But I ll pass on Binance   Thanks 34 9  Solana staking on binance today I think with farming in general  when you LP with stablecoins  you tend to limit your IL  When LPing other coins  your risk reward profile increases tremendously  amp  x200B So what you need to ask yourself is  what is my risk profile   Don t invest more than you can afford to lose   IL is a bitch   But if both your coins go up  you get double rewards That s Bruce Wayne he ll pump our bags who did the video  solid work Smart move  I like that  solana is bringing added value to the crypto verse Multiple layer 2 rollup networks are currently running  with more to launch later this year  The biggest exchange running on these rollups  Loopring  is currently doing  2 Million daily in volume with low transaction fees  Uniswap is adding rollup support within the next few months  Depending on type  rollups inherit most or all of the security guarantees of the underlying Ethereum network congrats SOL  Looking forward for it to grow BIG
2021-04-23,38.89918232,41.46325941,31.66427002,I happen to like the look and Ive noticed a lot of crypto projects have dark mode on their sites  so it should be familiar in a way to a lot of people  But yes  SPL support is a huge plus for FTX  Sending ERC20 tokens to a Solana wallet as SPL tokens also does not incur ETH gas fees as well which is awesome  If you wanted to farm the ETH RAY pool for instance  send your ETH from FTX to your Solana wallet and you re good to go  while avoiding ridiculous Ethereum gas fees People do not understand how important SPL support on exchange is  I can send or withdraw any amount of any SPL token in seconds for free  For example sending USDC to FTX is a few seconds operation  No withdrawal fees  FTX looks strange because of dark mode by default and no fancy graphics but functionality of UI and speed is excellent From  5 dollars  Hgggnnnnnnnn my pain missing that boat Cool  thanks I have been in a crypto for some years  I have a holding of 30 different projects  This is the one we re I have more hope  Maybe I m missing something but it s the one solving the trilemma in the most efficient way by far Hope so That is my line of reasoning as well Although I agree with your opinion that  100 is a conservative price target  I prefer organic growth with support built along the way up rather than a  balloon  type effect  Most L1 chains that ballooned were due to mass hysteria towards  revolutionary technology  and a bunch of unfulfilled promises by devs causing very disproportionate evaluations  When we hit  100 I will reevaluate my target if necessary but until then I m trying to stay conservative in hopes to have my expectations blown out of the water  Appreciate your feed back and best of luck with your investments According to solana website itself  everytime you want to delegate more to the same delegator you have to create a new staking account  You can t stack them without undelegating first and delegating the total amount later As for why you can t see and error messages  I m not too sure I haven t experience that before  Hope this helps abit i like this post    holding 600 from 5    Am i diamond hands 100 seems low by the end of the year  The market will be red hot by then  Other useless L1s will have ballooned way past the 30 40 billion they re at right now  and I predict solana being way past them  300 eoy Or mcx exchange I would also point out that those TdS rewards were only available for non US entities  and I would assume any future programs the foundation may come up with will be limited as well  which really sucks  Of course that s not Solana s problem  that s the US government  protecting  myself from myself Either does DOT for that matter    on top of that  chains like Ethereum  Cardano and Polkadot will not be able to support the types of things that Solana CURRENTLY DOES  such as a DEX with a central limit orderbook  Buckle up boys and girls  it s gonna be a wild ride I ve been in crypto since 2015  What I ve noticed is that whenever stable coin is introduced on a blockchain the price tends to reflect that  We have had over 1 billion in stable coin added since tether was announced around March  Ss stable coin continues to grow  and raydium keeps valued lock I think we should be fine  Also I think SBF is having a major role in promoting solana I tried this a couple of weeks ago since I already have an appropriate server set up  but ended up taking it down   u ZantetsuLastBlade2  see his helpful comments under  my post  https   www reddit com r solana comments mn9u7g attracting_stakers_to_a_validator  utm_source share amp utm_medium web2x amp context 3   put together a great calculator  but the upshot of it is that until you have  gt 10 000 of other peoples  SOL  or  gt 1000 of your own staked  you actually lose SOL by running a validator due to voting costs  On the other hand  if you can attract significant stake to your validator  it can be very profitable This means that running a validator is a social hurdle  not a technical one  They are aware this is a problem and are working on some solutions  in the past the  Tour de Sol  where they basically staked large amounts of foundation owned SOL with new delegators  and in the near future with stake pools It sounds annoying and like what people were trying before google  I don t see how blockchain adds value SOL is legit the soul of the crypto future   100 SOL by Summer SOLstice Too my knowledge that is correct  ADA is all theory and no product  As of January 20th  2021 Cardano does not support DApps  https   forum cardano org t dapp and smart contracts in cardano 45097 35 Billion market cap for essential an empty chain with no working products on it Does ADA even have smart contracts working yet  It seems so overvalued to me  when you already have working ecosystems in Solana  like DEXes and Defi Is the locked staking part of why it s so steady rn vs other crypto Even at full dilution we would be at 16 billion  Still undervalued any burns   Not why Yeahh looked into this myself  The specs for the PC will run about  3k USD roughly  Plus electricity as it will need to be on 24 7  The only thing that irks me is they do not have a clear layout or projection for potential returns  otherwise I would build the validator node this weekend One of the best investments I ve made in the last year  Still looking strong Imo Solana is the best place to invest right now  Risk vs reward is looking super promising but of course you never really know Bold prediction    I hope you re right Next is SRM  This is under radar and has potential of UniSwap like valuation or even more because it is heavily composable and is used by many Solana projects Exactly what I needed thank you  Good point about keeping sol for gas fees  I m so used to needing eth for gas  That is a TINY amount of sol for gas  Amazing SOL one of the few that stayed green and has 20xed since 2020  Thank you SOL Crypto com  Not sure they operate in US here you go https   www coingecko com en categories solana ecosystem  https   www coingecko com en categories solana ecosystem Back to 30 soon SOL is the fusion of everything good in crypto  it is my soul  as I am all in You should be able to filter by the tag  Solana Ecosystem  on Coingecko  If you open the Solana coin there should even be a link taking you there Not to be a jerk  but the English on that site is pretty bad   As a native English speaker it gives me the sense of a half baked product   Maybe that s not fair  I dunno Also as others have pointed out  it s not on Solana   So announcing this on Solana reddit with the title  Built on Solana  when it is in fact  not  built on Solana is a bit disingenuous I use exodus too If you would like to purchase sol without making an account and waiting for any verification  Use stealthex the only negative is the fees will be higher then ftx or binance Thanks bot Still trading way above last week  impressive Just buy BCH and xfer it to FTX us  then buy SOL  Alternatively  if you can get someone to give you a dollar in SOL  you can create a WBTC SPL account in a Solana wallet  buy BTC on Kraken  then use Sollet to receive native BTC and auto bridge it to that WBTC Solana account  Then you sell the WBTC for SOL on Serum    Confused  Read it again  It works great  Lmk if you re want a couple bucks in SOL to set it up  or just use FTX It was stifflers mom Now lol Not as jealous as yer mother    I  am  a  bot   Downvote  to  remove    PM  https   www reddit com message

https   youtu be GRQLMMX_3QE Just use exodus wallet Terrible fees on Exodus Get a SafePal wallet verification of binance Is nearly instant as its tied to SafePal then you can buy sol bnb and send your sol to whatever wallet you want Great words of confidence  Thank you Can t answer that  but I can say that  FTX us  https   FTX us  is where you need to be FTX  can t recommend it enough  Anyone who is interested in Solana needs to be on FTX  They have native Solana  SPL  token support  and are also just generally solid overall I just got verified on Binance US  It took 6 days so hopefully you will soon  Good luck Exodus I sold thinking it would dump like everything else  I m so sad managed to get a 2k bag at 21 77 when it dipped  D Can you tell me how to use Moonlet for Solana   I am using the app on iPhone  and it will only allow me to deposit ZIL  NEAR  and ETH   How do I add SOL to the wallet i think its out of beta soon I just think it s because solanda seems to be the best competitor to ETH 2 0 atm when you look at the technical capabilities u MurkWahlberg2019 HMA VPN works just fine Uphold is quick Where   Its not on any US platform except Binance   which has tons of complaints I agree on this Ftx us Try Uphold Have not I m sure it took a lot of restraint not to take profits  Nice job Whats the market cap Definitely  Let s hope there s no dump ftx us is the place you re looking for Sorry  not sure about that No  it ll create that account in your wallet for you Should ve mentioned this im in the US If you re in the UK crypto com has it to sell  If you re not in the UK  use a VPN  which works for me Thanks for this To clarify my understanding   if I want to swap eth to usdc on raydium  do I first need to add a USDC token to my Solana wallet did you try Phantom wallet Just click trading tab on  raydium io  https   raydium io   and trade eth for USDC then trade USDC for SOL Yes agreed  14 4  for 30 days locked  and much higher thresholds  is also very good though  There is a huge   of SOL locked in staking which reduces supply  In a bull market with great undervalued tech I think this fuels the pump we are seeing These comments really haven t aged well There is also raydium or serum for those who want to try DeFi ok  thanks  I had never done that  I just knew that Sollet lets you send ETH  well once it is done  swapping or trading them is pretty easy AFAIK  no dApps like that exists on Solana yet Any way to do it through Coinbase wallet via uniswap or sushiswap Can you do it through coinbase wallet via uniswap or sushiswap I hold on SolFlare but access my wallet root account using my Nano S which is the best way imo to hold it  Hopefully Ledger issue a firmware update to allow to open an account within my Nano S rather than just using it as a hardware access key Yea  I didn t catch that you mentioned Orca specifically when I first read your post Got your point  thank you I was referring to Raydium not having that pool because that is where Serum swap  which I guess was done away with  directed him  I did see  and later edited  that Orca has an ETH SOL pool  but it s also unavailable in the US  unless you get creative Thanks my friend If you re referring to Orca  check this link   https   www orca so pools  https   www orca so pools ETH SOL is already available   https   i postimg cc ydN79kbq image png  https   i postimg cc ydN79kbq image png gt Is solona like a parallel blockchain to eth Yes  they are separate blockchains  When you have a token on Ethereum that is an ERC20 token which means it s native to that blockchain  On Solana native tokens are SPL tokens  When you transfer a token from Ethereum to Solana it becomes a wrapped SPL token That s not right solflare is just showing you your account from ledger  The coins are always there since you have the key  You might be missing something  For now just use exodus and I ll try finding a video walkthrough to help with staking 𝐖𝐞𝐞𝐤𝐥𝐲 𝐒𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐲

stake  then the next day I was installed and there was a banner on my account that said my wallet was being used by solanabeach io and if I closed the page it would lose connection   Shit show if you ask me Moonlet should let you stake  It doesn t matter what interface you use since the ledger is holding all your coins  But if moonlet doesn t let you then yeah just use solflare Once you are in the user interface just click  stake  at the top and then click stake account  your ledger will ask you to send your coins to a sub account to stake  and from there you ll be able to delegate to a validator  You can use Solanabeach io to research a validator I m certain I am making a bigger issue of this than need be   I think the key is to connect my Ledger first and see if I get an address   Do I have to stake through solflare   Moonlet won t stake for me   And thank you for all your help   I really appreciate So you should be able to see your ledger address on your moonlet app  Then you can send a test amount to your ledger from exodus or any exchange  From there you can then use solflare  which will recognize the ledger address when you connect it   and make a staking account  I m honestly surprised that moonlet doesn t let you stake right now if it is letting me Nordvpn I m on exodus now   I m bummed because I don t see how to connect to a hardware wallet  SOL Ok  so I ll try pairing my Ledger on Moonlet   It has SOL app on it already  but no SOL balance since Ledger Live is not supporting yet    sigh I guess then that adds the account to Moonlet   And will give me an address which to send my SOL from Exodus   Currently  my Moonlet app is only showing the three coins mentioned earlier Pretty basic  when I set mine up it asked for a pin  I connected my ledger vis Bluetooth and then I was able to creat a staking account from my ledger  make sure ledger has solana app   But I think I d moonlet isn t working just use exodus  It s super easy to use Cool  I love you Those are the only three coins my moonlet app shows  According to the tutorial  it should show SOL  which mine doesn t   So  how does one go about funding a SOL wallet on Moonlet anyway I m sure this is all because I don t know what the hell im doing   I m reading the tutorial on Moonlet now That s odd  I ve been staking with them for a while If that s the case I still recommend exodus Got a sol bag when I got the cope drop  got it at 19 check out this twitter thread  https   twitter com adamscochran status 1385291204938674189  https   twitter com adamscochran status 1385291204938674189

when I choose any of the others  I get I have 1 5 SOL in the account You can swap from USDT on just about any exchange First thing to do is to have some SOL there in you  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  wallet as Gas Fees  like 0 01 SOL would be more than enough   then go a head with the Swap again Good luck The eth shows up as   Sollet  ETH  When I go to raydium to swap  it will allow me to swap eth to ray  but if I choose eth to any other token  it won t work  I get Thanks  Yeah FTX US works for US customers Please help me  where can I buy Solana without any verification for a regular wallet like exodus   not binance and etc Thanks for the quick replies I used Metamask to transfer an eth to new  sollet io  https   sollet io  account  The coin is labelled  Sollet  ETH  I m new to cryptosphere  Is solona like a parallel blockchain to eth When Sending ETH from Metamask to  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  you will receive ETH Later on  swapping   trading that ETH to any other coin of your choice is done through Dexes build on Solana  SerumDex  Raydium  Orca If the ETH is in your Solana wallet then it is an SPL  native Solana  token now  If you re talking about converting that ETH to SOL  then you ll wanna use  Serum  https   swap projectserum com   to do a swap from ETH to SOL I m on blockfolio  the price per coin to buy or sell swings from  50  75 cents per coin so if there is somewhere else that is cheaper check that out  Does FTX work for US accounts  Does it have to be used on your computer with a VPN Regarding sending from Metamask to Sollet    I believe the fees are higher doing that than they would be sending to FTX and then out  but I may be wrong As for BSC  I don t use it so I was not aware that they don t support ERC20  I guess I just assumed they did  But if not  then I guess you ll need to send them to Binance to convert  or if you can buy SOL on BSC then just do that and ship it out would prob be easiest How did you sent your ETH to your account  which wallets did you use  I am pretty sure that if you use Metamask to send ETH to  for example  a Sollet wallet  they are converted to SOL automatically Sollet wallet also lets you send ETH directly from Metamask and they are converted in SOL  Very useful  but not in my case Also sending my USDC to FTX  as somebody suggested  will not work in my specific case because they are already on BSC and not on Binance anymore  If they were still in ERC20 I could send them to FTX and they would convert them in Solana tokens on withdrawal to a Sollet wallet If that can be useful for you guys  FTX does not accept USDC in BEP 20  BSC  version  but  does accept  BUSD as BEP 2  careful  not BEP 20  tokens Yes Can you stake from Moonlet also Moonlet app with ledger I m not worry about inflation but how the max supply can influenze the growth of the price It s the most ungodly thing I ve ever used   I could not get the staking to work  the platform is awful   Granted  I used the mobile version   The staking rewards on exodus are very generous as well Why do you not care for SolFlare You can keep up with  and exceed  inflation by staking your sol Yeah but it s limited to 20 SOL  Meaning at the end of 15 days we ll have 0 3 SOL extra  It s a basic promo they ll have done to get more people buying an on fire asset  They did the same with atom a few months back Is this for Solana only or also ERC 20  like metamask Massively undervalued as others have said  Other reason for the big spike is the good APY yield in staking  I have a small amount of SOL giving 34  in binance which is a ridiculous yield That was a very well written article   Thank you for posting it Yes a percentage of transaction fees are burned   When transactions are in the tens of thousands per second  this will be significant The inflation rate is going to reduce every year until it hits 1 5    At that rate  if Solana has grown the way it should have  transaction fee burn my very well offset inflation  or at least reduce it significantly So Solana will not have significant inflation forever   If it is truly successful  its long term inflation should be pretty small Things get priced fairly early in crypto  I say it will take 20 days to reach  100 widevpn  suport wireguard  unblock any content I m sorry it didn t work out for you   But keep checking for news because stake pools may make it more feasable to become a validator    Keep in mind also that it is possible to start a validator with zero commission and little stake  self staked  or maybe staked with a group of friends  stake   and try to build stake over time   It is like any business  you have to invest something to try to build a  customer base
2021-04-24,37.25749642,43.53222132,34.68329376,On Binance you can trade BUSD USDT BNB BTC for SOL Ok and that differs how from every other crypto  every other stock    What do you think the people here are doing  No hate  just saying   I have done my research and thats why im here  But I ve done my research and thats why im LOVING every minute i hold my INVESTMENT in doge If you have an FTx us referral code can you dm me please I use moonpay the drug in the movie is same as  meth  really really identic the comedowns and the high from it Like I said  one of the main reasons is they support SPL  native Solana  tokens  None of the other exchanges  that I ve used anyway  do  And if you re in the US your options to buy Solana are limited  Binance us is prob the most popular option  but it will take weeks to get approved What is apy for staking on exodus Looks to me like you are trying to Swap more SOL than you have as a balance  4 950776440 vs 4 950766440 Conundrum  you have to put some Sol in your wallet before you can put any Sol in your wallet  How again does that work  It Preach I would do some test sends  first  as always From the looks of this tweet  you can convert to erc20  send to coin98 or Sollet io and convert https   twitter com solanians_ status 1374665502535032834 s 21 Is there something like defistation or defipulse to track TVL of projects I signed up  They deposited 0 4 MATIC into my account  Also gave me an ETH address How do I use switch to solana Send a dollar to try it out How  Don t want to send funds to it and then find out I can t withdraw them Buy XLM  Stellar  on coinbase and then transfer to binance or Exodus  Exodus is more noob friendly and binance is more in depth  On binance sell your XLM for USDT  Then trade USDT for SOLOn Exodus you can directly convert to SOL from XLM I don t see how a blockchain can encrypt a 4K stream and add it to the blockchain One of my favorite movies If there is one thing I realise while holding doge  is that every post in that community is aimed to influence you into holding buying selling Great to hear bud   Any good resources to share so I can do my DD and hopefully jump in  I always like to see how people do their research no more hype trains and emotional trading  what Since you re in Canada  you can create an account at  FTX  https   ftx com  a 18171645  to buy SOL  This is the exchange I use  and their daily volume is in the  100M on average for SOL  They also offer staking for a handful of coins so you could take a look at that I would suggest Coinsquare as well if you already have an account to buy in CAD and send over to FTX  or use Crypto dot com s app to buy in CAD and send to FTX I genuinely don t think a price target of  500 even is unrealistic  but it definitely wouldn t be by end of year  SOL reaching  500 would put it at a total supply market cap of  244 billion  In order for SOL to reach that  BTC and ETH would be much higher in price as well  But a  244B cap would put it at a higher valuation than BNB and in my opinion  BNB shouldn t even be at its current price   This is all just in terms of market cap  but in terms of the blockchain itself I m sure there will be many improvements and implementations way before that price point  Also when ETH eventually moves to staking  people will be looking at other coins to stake and SOL is quite attractive in that regard Yea it will show up once the it is unstaked  takes a couple days It is but it may be a work around for you I thought blockfolio is just a frontend app for FTX This could be a game changer I m not sure a guide is needed  It s pretty easy  You just enter the amount you wish to stake and press ok Do you know of any good  How to  guides Yes it is From your wallet page  just click on  stake Congrats I ll give it a try when I get home  much love man Solana Ty You need some SOL for fees  Try lowering it to 4 94  If it fails again  try 4 93 It takes 48 hours I believe Use blockfolio in that case I don t remember this raw checkbox  Can it be done afterwards  Export the raw FTX over everything for sure Art thee reserving enow f r fees  either yond  r tryeth increasing slippage      I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout Are you reserving enough for fees  Either that or try increasing slippage I m new to Solana as well  I was able to successfully buy some on FTX this week I bought my first batch of SOL   8 in early Feb   It was one of 23 coins I was holding at the time   I decided during early April to consolidate that number of coins down to 12   I have currently have 13 but it was SOLs resistance to the BTC drops that convinced me not only that SOL was one I was keeping but I doubled my holding in it   I bought my second batch   30 and it is still above that despite the BTC DIP while all of my other coins have dropped value At this point in time  as an investor  it looks to me like SOL is a very good investment and I may increase my holding more once I decide if I want to consolidate from 13 coins down to 12 or even 10 In the current market I m not going to add more investment because I would rather wait to see if BTC is going to drop further but I have some other coins due to end their staking periods in the next 2 3 weeks and at that point I will decide whether to restake them or move that money elsewhere FTXI can DM a referral code if you d like Same for me   I deleted chrome history and now after I put my seed phrase system offers me brand new adressess  Anyone know how to restore old funded waleet Thanks for the award  We are looking to develop something massive to drive crypto to main stream Please do help us with the short survey if you can  Thank you so much I also have Solana staked in exodus  It says that it takes  4 days to unstake  I ve never unstaked before so I m curious on what the process is  Please keep us informed I ve tried making it 4 95 and still says I ain t got enough sol I have the same issue  Unstaking sol in Exodus makes balance display as 0  My guess is that it just means it s not available right now but once the 4 days are up  it will show up  But it s very unnerving  My guess is you have to bring this up with Exodus I m very confused now   So  on my ledger live app  there is no Solana listed   I can add it to my wallet device  however  to use an external wallet  much the same as I do with Cardano   I can use a third party wallet  but I cannot see my funds or transactions via Lesger Live   Is this what you mean Thank you Welcome aboard I use Uphold  but that s only because I use Brave  Uphold has some high fees Ledger Live does have a Solana app  just not a wallet capability yet No Ftx US  What are reasons you d recommend it  I m also wanting to purchase SOL IOTA Do you have a SOL wallet Damn    Any idea of how much it will cost Solana com ecosystem although the best resource is twitter hands down ask yourselves  have you ever used algo for anything  dapps What do you mean  You can buy it on Binance With USDT or BNB I think you re right  I honestly expect this to beat BSC Can t go through FTX  already maxed out my limit on withdrawals Its a sleeping giant  trust me  i believe in Swiss guys and that PoH is insane sick  I see a really big value in this  But maybe i am wrong  we will see FTX to Sollet    Wrapped Bitcoin  Sollet    https   i postimg cc JhCZJPdX image png  https   i postimg cc JhCZJPdX image png   PS    always try a small amount first  a  1 or less

doesn t matter Hahah I love this  I was only just saying this to my wife  NO ONE is really talking about it because they re all waiting for a dip to actually get some  Meanwhile the market crashes and SOL reaches new ATH s  Extremely exciting times Indeed  this  if you want to be a validator  get viral or go home  has been the plague of DPOS since its inception  Solana has the first part of the puzzle  in the fact that multiplying the number of validators will not make the network grind to a halt as it does in other consensus algorithms  because of its technical fundamentals  which are great   but still  this profitability issue is a pain   I hope the Solana team  aided by the community  can figure something out I bought more today  And I will buy more next week  I believe it s definitely undervalued It s still closed beta  I hope they will support something else than Chrome in their plugins Safe amp easy to use wallet options are indeed scarce right now  Too many devs using well maintained  rock solid linux distros and thinking that web wallets  are enough   maybe  Raydium does not support Solflare yet for example  But that will probably change soon  Sollet also has an option

SOL costs 0 on the receiver s end  however  receiving SPL  the Solana equivalent of ERC 20  tokens on a Solana address can require the receiver to spend a small SOL gas fee That s the Raydium interface  They have a  sub  https   www reddit com r Raydium   but the only mod there seems to be a bot  and that mod does not seem to validate requests to post  I hope the Raydium team will have the resources to take care of their subreddit someday soon So many coins have achieved crazy valuations although their fundamentals were non existent  Here  I would say  it is one of those rare cases where the technical fundamentals of a coin finally get to speak  If it s easier for you  you can buy a fraction now  then read more on Sol  the landscape  competitors etc  and finally buy more later if what you ve seen satisfies you Indeed  in a way  The current state of affairs won t prevent even moderately skilled entities from reconstructing everything  but it will prevent everyday users from even seeing straight in their finances  But most of this is young  SPL and Serum are just out of the gates  and Wormhole is coming  so the ergonomic apps and APIs will come I think fair point  Don t really know myself  Just hate seeing short term losses regardless  so id like to maximise any profits where possible But you can see the video here on solana reddit   Someone posted it If you buy some now and some during dips it ll bring you average cost lower  So you don t have to worry about possibly missing out on a lower price if this is the lowest we ll see in a while or not Are you seeking long term or short term gains  If long term  years   then waiting for a dip is irrelevant IMHO  But it s your call It has been taken off the website now   strange what Dollar Cost Average Changelly  Not sure they re available in the US  KYC is not systematic  only on transactions detected by the system apparently   https   changelly com fr aml kyc  https   changelly com fr aml kyc    so less friction for the users It goes without saying  and yet I feel the need to shout   THERE IS NO MASS ADOPTION OF SOL WITHOUT PUBLIC KEY TRX TRANSPARENCY FOR ALL TRXS moonpay  https   www moonpay com Actually Exodus app has it If you absolutely don t want to   can t use Binance FTX  there s Changelly also that can do e g  EOS SOL exchanges  EOS can be bought anywhere  so that s convenient Interested in that as well  Currently  even making SPL transactions on sollet generates tens of  transaction  lines per actual transaction  and it s really cumbersome to build your own transaction history  For example  you can t even find easily how much  exactly  in each coin not LP tokens  did you stake in liquidity pools etc  Once the ecosystem builds some easier usability on Solana it will truly take off You got it Unless you buy a million dollars worth right now Wow relatable  I d have to look at my history but I was on the website playing around back when it was under  10 and I went hmm this seems cool  Didn t buy until  27 I bought a bunch but got trapped selling on that 4 17 daily candle  Cannot find entry back ever since  Still bang my head against the wall gt All I need are the basics    trx type  which coin   to which  when  fee type and amount   Check  https   docs solana com  https   docs solana com There is never ever ever a dip with solana Stock only goes up TY  All I need are the basics  trx type  which coin   to which  when  fee type and amount  I m a rank SQL analysis skill level    It s not my bag  baby I can t be the only one        Is there anybody out there Binance us doesn t have sol Nah SOL is 10B market cap  It could do 30x over the next 3 years  Price projection   1200 You need at least 1000 SOL  if you want to be a millionaire in 3 years Market tings Got you an answer from     u ZantetsuLastBlade2    https   www reddit com user ZantetsuLastBlade2    i hope it helps with what you need   Depending on your needs  you can suck a fair amount of data out of the JSON RPC API in JSON structured format   You can t get the arbitrary state of the ledger at any time though Blockfolio  ftx us Where does it say this on the website  I can t seem to find it The million dollar question huh If you buy for 1 million dollar of Solana  you will be millionaire instantly How much sol to be millionaire in 3 years FACT I am sorry that I am not  yet  very proficient in Solana programming  in terms of programming their on chain programs   I do know that there is a  memo  program that is currently in use that takes as input a UTF 8 string   The idea is that just encoding the call to that program is in essence embedding any arbitrary string into the transaction since the UTF 8 string is the input data of the transaction   I have noticed that this is often used to store base64 encoded binary data that means who knows what to whatever system is issuing these transactions with these memos I don t know how tokens get minted on Solana    if there is an opportunity to run a custom program as part of minting the coin  then you could call the memo program as a means of storing any arbitrary data in the transaction that mints the token In terms of whether or not the tokens can have metadata  that I don t know either  sorry   Wish I could be more help   The best place to ask is probably the developer support channel in the Solana Discord Perfect  i really want to give u an award  but i have everything in SOL yolo  i like the project People who want their exchange to list Solana really need to be pushing the exchange itself   Put pressure on them   Let them know that you ll go to other exchanges if they don t list Solana   Asking on reddit is fine  but it s not a replacement for letting your exchange know how you feel Doesn t matter when you buy  If you can hold onto this coin you ll be a millionaire in 3 years time okay thanks  i ll wait until i see an dip to eat Who knows   the hype around SOL reminds me of Eth 2017  If you are short termist  there might be a dip tonight after this crazy twitter fuelled hike   but in 3 months today s high will look cheap anyway Sorry man not sure  I m just sitting here wallowing in self pity because I didn t buy it on Friday at 43 dollars I been waiting for the dip since 35 so do i wait on the next one  or hop on now It already dipped FTX   Binance is the way to go Hey we ve all been there  However  just remember that  the potential of a project that is being built by ex Qualicom engineers and developing a vast ecosystem is amazing  Sure  speculate but not with all your portfolio  Use earnings  new money or a portion as moonshots but then invest in the real bedrock startups and don t shift Ofc    Welcome     I will planning buy more on 40   haha   Waiting for 100 Just the start  At a near on 10  stake reward small circulating supply and new customers coming onboard it looks great Iota is a chosen one I wanted to get in at  25 last weekend but was still waiting on verification   Finally was able to get in at  34 this week   I guess it s better than nothing Big plays  congrats You could use FTX or  FTX US  https   FTX US  Kraken has a mailing list they use to announce new listings  Don t remember how I got on it  but you could always contact them and ask I got in at 6  and it s been my best move do you have a favored one from not popular ones  want to use a manual input option   have some cents there want use them for adding token generate some adress and tokens     may be this 28th april thing is bound with somehow airdrops  just giving a try There is plenty of Native Tokens already there  others are Wrapped  wETH  wBTC       So it s up to you what to add there in your Solelt Wallet  whatever suits your needs suggestion i mean no offer  D just explore some coins and sol Tried that  I can t deal with the Discord communication format  let Reddit rule gt  do you have any   offer for token add   I didn t quiet understand what you mean by this Every Token added will cost you around 0 02 SOL  may be that s what you re asking for or is there any list of add manual coins just added tokens and i emptied it  made a new one  do you have any offer for token add Now your questions make sense  i m not aware of something like this exist on any Solana dApps yet My advice is to head to  Solana Discod  https   discord com invite pquxPsq   the best place to dig into this even more Then you can t restore your wallet somewhere else  it risky to keep your assets there  once your browser storage is deleted somehow Start a new wallet  amp  make sure to save your Seed Words somewhere safe   Noob Tips    Before using your newly opened wallet  try to restore it first so to make sure the Seed Words were copied the right way  if things goes 100  well  then send your assets to it Micro version of that concept   I  need ledger records to import into CoinTracking i made it once but lost seed words  have wallet adress and there is lots of manual token adds moonpay  https   www moonpay com I buy from  moonpay  https   www moonpay com     easy and straightforward gt Arweave and Solana partnered to provide a decentralised permanent data storage solution of ledger data  ensuring the data can be always retrieved as required If that s what you mean  then the Data Storage is kind of Solved already for SOL   Source     https   solana com de ecosystem arweave  https   solana com de ecosystem arweave Well that is the plan   Buy and Hodl  However I have kind of paper hands  So I unstake on binance and it takes just 48 hours  I like that band on atomic takes 21 days to unbond   Is there any staking option like that for SOL  That takes long time to lock up   That would help me to hodl a lot It s up to the    freeliquid    team to decide that  to migrate to Solana Blockchain  amp  scale their project to whole new levels  D I will say this though   Something that I think is strange  is happening   There is a validator called Everstake and they ve had thousands of small stake accounts delegated to them continuously for days weeks now   They are now over 8 000 delegators   It s very strange And then they stopped acquiring new ones     right when the price started going up today   It s all very strange   Maybe there is a rational explanation  I don t know https   ibb co album qBqzwMhttps   ibb co bXRBjSs AFAIK  nothing like that that exist yet in any Solana dApps i m aware of  except   may be   for Raydium Fusion Pool Yes    Hear you  I do believe in Solana  Just waiting for a dip Also one thing I learned is that  as hard as it is  it s better to get back into something you believe in at a higher price than you could have paid previously  than to not get back in at all   Better to make profit even if it s less than you  could have made  than to make no profit at all That being said  this is not investment advice   I have no idea if Solana will keep going up from here or will drop Good reference to blades of glory Does ATOM Check out the doge btc chart from Bittrex on tradeview  Always been a pump and dump Wow  been with the solana since 10 15   Top 10 in crypto space would not suprise me anymore It probably helps that SOL took the last two bitcoin drops like a champ  People who are scared of the market may be looking to SOL as a safe haven  Too many cryptos are recovering still and SOLs pulling all time highs Yea I didn t reserve enough for fees   here s a tip for all that sees  step token  thanks every one You didn t tell us what Dex is that you re using for the Swap so we can help you out You need to have at least 0 01 SOL as Gas Fees in your wallet To UnDelegate   UnStake it takes a whole   Epoch    an   Epoch   is almost   3 days   Check when the   Epoch   Start   End in here   https   solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io Reach out to Exodus support   They ve comped me in the past for little things like not understanding more VETHO was required to move VET  so they comped me 5 dollars worth bad bot I think there s been news of new things building on SOL in the last month   But it s likely the price reaching its correct value  who knows   Hard to say I learnt after 2017 never to do that after ruining my btc ethereum positions  Just DCA  buy dips  stake and HODL  And if you sell  sell some when you need fiat and you are at a good profit  I personally never buy pumps  I always by sideways or just after a dip seems to be done  I make 0 2 Sol a day just from staking now and I use that as profits or reinvestment in other tokens dot  atom  etc Just a good coin gaining interest as it climbs in market cap Lol doge has and will ruin plenty of lives Z Yes  it s working fine    it was already staking on my old phone but i want to add my account also on the new phone  You could check the Solana docs  there are explainations about the staking unstaking period This chart isn t entirely accurate 1   Solana transaction latency is longer  I know I ve heard it s supposed to be 0 4 sec but if you go the main Solana site you will see there are blocks that take 800ms  I m not sure why 2   BSC is much faster than the transaction latency that is listed 3   Is Polkadot really that slow 4   Somebody forgot big daddy Bitcoin It takes a restart of the app  I think  to show your wallet on Moonlet  after adding it   I didn t see mine for several days Add your SOL wallet to Moonlet and follow the instructions I use Blockfolio I suspect this is main reason why SOL keeps going up   Damn doge   I sold my SOL just for a quick doge pump   and now I m not being able to buy back SOL at a fair price  My fault thou   Falling for this stupid doge hype It s been a challenge  getting a secure SOL wallet established   Have you started using Moonlet yet   I m still waiting on my unstaking period on a different platform to deposit on Moonlet try 4 94 The problem was my network behind the Pi hole    something was blocked  I try it without wifi and Pi hole     then it showed me Solana and could connect with my ledger  Thanks Any suggestions for someone in Canada Thanks So  after 2 days linking my Ledger to Moonlet Solana finally showed up on the dashboard   Thanks for all your help   Not sure why this took so long   Looking forward to using it for staking   Have a great weekend I went through the exact same thing   I was frustrated to no end   Finally  I walked away and signed back in to Moonlet and it showed Solana   I had to go through the setup with Ledger on Moonlet and it still only showed ZIL  ETH and NEAR   Try signing out  maybe restart your phone and your Lesger No one knows what it means  but it s PROVOCATIVE Can t use Binance us in Texas unfortunately Just out of curiosity Why not binance US Yes SIR  Looking forward to the obstacle course  SIR Everybody has to start somewhere and we started in Doge in Feb 2021  From that moment on  Doge has been been rising like crazy and the markets went wild  We then started buying Safemoon and went with the hype as well  fortunately bailing out with a profit  Doge  for us  became too volatile to keep especially after the  not sure if its true  whale started selling over and over last week  Keep in mind that there is not really anything tangible backing up the coin just yet  And so we decided to take our  nice  profit and go here  A coin backed by a company that feels legit  a tech behind it thats solid and future proof and a coin thats not being pushed up by masses and media I LOVE Doge coin but not enough to take the risk of losing that profit and effort we put into it Solana is a long run coin for us and we expect to hodl  The future looks bullish enough to even risk staking it Please keep in mind that all these decisions were made with the knowledge have and research we did  This might be lacking severly in comparison to others  knowledge and research done Aye  Recruit  Welcome to the men s Department of Cryptography  holdiers  Staking ready to deploy  Ready  move Sorry I meant FTX US  I m guessing not since I don t see  Stake  as an option in my wallet Yes you can  but you need to wait 14days if you want to unstake Is staking better than spotting I am the same  It never shows rewards or any information other than it is staked Since the day that movie came out  I m still dreaming about that pill  I need it  I want it I accidentally uploaded the wrong photo for my ID and couldn t change it  Was stuck waiting for over 30 days to get denied haha Thanks for the info
2021-04-25,40.84547073,48.43426663,40.51201668,If you re in the U S and not using a VPN you can acquire SOL by buying Oxygen and converting it from ERC 20 to SPL tokens on  sollet io  https   sollet io   Then you can connect sollet to  raydium io  https   raydium io  and trade the Oxygen for USDC then buy SOL with the USDC Bout to dump a fat bag into this FTX  Blockfolio  Binance Notable projects not above  COPE  STEP  MANGO  MEDIA  MAPS  Which one s am I missing This is where mine is Uphold has it i have mine in exodus wallet 200 for this year If you think SOL is under valued then you would definitely thing Harmony ONE is too    no idea how people are passing this up Yea I know and I ve had mine staked for weeks  I m gonna keep an eye in my exact amount to see if any of the decimals change SOL is going to suck the soul out of everyone who whiffed on this excellent cryptocurrency  when it was at  13 SOL   it quietly sat bouncing to  18 SOL for several weeks and then back down  It consolidated like an ignored lonely bloke  who was on a three week bender in a strip club  The bloke is home now  and the balls are no longer bruised and blue  Let SOL be with you  Amen   100 SOL by end of May A correction is due but probably 30 40 not 25   25 would be that wick that hits for a split second   The only thing that could take it down there is if Bitcoin suddenly dropped to 33K Love this project   SOLman for life Just got 17 Solana   This one really caught my eye when I saw every other cryptocurrency drop like a rock while Solana was holding steady My goal is to buy 8 more coin as I only have 2 XD Let s be real  there is sooo much shit out there right now Look at all the meme coins and friends with multi billion dollar market caps  I mean   really To me this project here is an exceptionally brisk refresher from all the shilly shit I think they are just incredibly bad at marketing so far  so I am helping out  oh hi  but from what I can tell the project looks remarkably profound and high potential   ‍ ️ bcuz its going up I just swapped a sizable chunk from Etherum with Solana  Why  Bc my belief is at all time high like SOL Love this coin    SRM as well Thanks mate  well on binance sol staking you unlock in 2 days  and better APY  But more important for me is long lock up time   Like  band  on atomic wallet is 21 days lock up time to unbond  I have paper hands   So only way for me to hodl is to have it hard locked in staking  4 days i s better than 2   So I might move it to exodus instead I think a lot of people are going to base their  realistic  goals by comparing Solana  market cap  with that of other competitive block chains   The story being that Solana is at 1 3 or less the market cap of other chains like Cardano  which could put a reasonable expectation of 3x price growth of Solana I think there are other factors involved here     all of these chains have locked coins that could push prices down across the board for all of them as the coins unlock There could be a pull back of investment in crypto However  I personally do believe that Solana is demonstrably superior to every chain other than Ethereum  and is technically superior to Ethereum too but less mature and with less widespread support   So I personally do not see any reason that Solana wouldn t go to  3 in market cap However  I am not buying more Solana   I am just too worried about price corrections  either specifically for Solana or for the market in general  and it s also very easy to fall into the irrational trap of not believing that its current value is sustainable only because you knew it when it was valued a lot less   Which is honestly a bush league investment mindset but I m heavily susceptible to it That being said  I m not selling my holdings either   I bought with the intention of not selling for at least 2 years  and so far I am sticking to it SOL IS almost top 10 guys   This is insane Haha yeah legit  Crazy thing is if it keeps going SOL could literally but top 10 by the end of today The moment I capitulate and finally go in is when it will reverse course  I swear haha Yeah I know what you mean man  You just keeping thinking    surely this pump will slow down at some point  I keep flipping SOL hoping for a dip to then buy more but nope    just keeps going hahah I have three 0 01 SOL accounts that I accidentally created when I was trying to split for staking   I decided to keep them instead of merging them back in  as the accounts that I will  forget  and will be worth  1 000 each some day   I m setting myself up to experience one of those  oh I found some old accounts that I thought were worthless at the time and forgot about but wow look what they re worth now  stories relateable fundamentals  gt  technical analysis sometimes  I hope you re right about the pull back though Upto 4 days  same as anywhere for Sol staking it hurts to watch my whale bags becoming more worthless when denominated in SOL day after day waiting for the dip that never arrives This is true  badi is all the coins are owned by the same people that buy sell after Bitcoin    Solana is the only fucking exception   I wonder if nobody bought it    Are there any whale How is the unstaking process  Any lock up time No stop it hurts too much at this stock   Are you kidding me Ah crap all of us thinking this seem to be getting priced out Well  there was your dip Yeah it s unfortunate that its hard to tell what your staking rewards received are on Exodus  Unless I m missing something I sort of expected you know a deposit of this amount of coin every time a reward was earned like they do when you deposit SOL into your wallet High Eth Gas Fees Thanks  would check it out Originality No  sorry  Thank you for answer Solana  175 end of 2021 Speculation How to buy How to buy 10 69 Absolutely massive You need the solana app on your ledger  Not ledger live I m not sure if you know what that word means but not sure how I am spreading fear  uncertainty or doubt  I m just sharing my thoughts on where I think SOL will be end of the year same as most of us do  I ll also add I m australian and talking about it in AUD   currently it s 60 per SOL   so we are 40  off target and not half way through the year How can it be supported as a daily user  Can one make ANY effort to increase it s value without pumping it with money  Obviously it has a usage so what use can one make of it as an avarage dude SOL was the sleeper in the crypto race  and were just getting started  Top 5 in market cap by end of May The path to salvation is in the SOL Dude  If you doubt Cardano  you need to check your head  Its valued at were it is for a reason  SmartContract is live on the testnet and goes live on the mainnet by june 26th  April 29th will be anouncement of the africadeal with many more to come over there    i hold ETH  DOT  ADA and SOL because they will each have their share of the market  But ADA has by far the biggest potential i agree  so we also agree this price behaviour is fishy  some one or a group single handedly moving it  in eth   there were tools to analyse this   do you happen to know how to analyse this at sol 1  First option      sign up for Binance FTX   If required  depending on your investment target   complete KYC   Both will offer you to buy Solana with Fiat credit card  or at least  to buy USDT and then convert USDT to solana without leaving the exchange2  Second option a  buy EOS or TRX on any exchange  Coinbase  expensive    crypto com  https   crypto com   Kraken  anything works  with a credit cardb  Withdraw EOS TRX and send them  deposit  to Binance or FTX b  convert EOS TRX into USDT and then USDT into Solana one of the two exchanges above  Bonus  because you re not using FIAT on the big exchanges  they let you do this without requiring a  complete   and slow  KYC 3  Third option a  buy EOS TRX on any exchangeb  setup a Changelly account  No automatic KYC c  exchange EOS to SOL by sending your EOS to the address Changelly will provide  You ll need a SOL wallet  where Changelly will send your SOL  for simplicity you can use Trust wallet or Exodus Probably  in the near future  there will be more straightforward options  for now  this is what we have Why would you short this project relative to its competitors  good luck Don t really know what the funk this is but I ll check it out  Anatoly is a bright guy we gon hit 10k subs today  Very cool  buckle up and hold on tight ladies and gents Just saying  i wouldn t be surprised  It s not saying a whole lot but Mike Novogratz is bullish on SOL This thing literally come out of thin air   This subreddit is barely active  Best I can do is some strange crypto twitter profiles shilling this 26x in 4 months is slow and steady  I agree on your correction part  Shorting since   42 and   45  target around 25 30 You talk as if it went 26x overnight  It s been on a strong  slow and steady climb since January with multiple healthy corrections  If anything  the next correction will pull it back to  30  40 range  and that s being very conservative No but healthy pull back to around   25 40  Its not strange to have multiple big corrections during a bull run  Ethereum dropped from   2000 to around   1400 last month   Crazy that people forget that its normal to have 30   correction during bull runs That won t happen until the the end of bitcoin s bull cycle and we enter the next bear market  most altcoins have gone up since the start of january  Look at BNB  are you expecting that to drop back to  40 real soon too  And ETH to drop to  900  And UNI back to  5 what is the implication of this  could you please elaborate  thanks Fact that it went 26x since start of the year    nothing does that 26x since start of the year  Correction will be painful for the noobs Thats because this whole bull run isn t authentic  The thing went 26x in 4 months  This run is fueled by a couple of Crypto persona s  Newb investors will be rugpulled  This has happened in 2017 as well I was waiting for it to dip below 40 again but decided to just buy now  I m future if it s 100  I m not going to care Exodus 10 49  APY Ftx Binance offers good interest rate for short periods  15  30 or 90 days ok wow thank s for that  I understand now If you find any info please let me know Hello  i am expecting same issue  When restoring my solong wallet by seed  12 words  there isn t my old SOL addy shown up  but something else  I tried several wallets by importing my seed  Every single one showed up with a different SOL addy without any other token Until our industry is properly regulated we are always going to find ourselves in the middle of a whale battle or market manipulation  I ve been investing for 5 years in stocks and 2 years in crypto and my advice is this In the stock market  this type of behavior leads to a massive correction and leads to a stock crash  especially if there isn t a quarterly report or news that justifies a massive spike in price  In crypto  it can rise 60  only to crash back down 80   The bigger the dip  the bigger the bounce back  We are such a new industry and a TINY market cap right now around  2 trillion  When we hit  10   20 and even  50 trillion cap we will no longer see these massive swings on protocols and projects that are proven and established New coins will always fluctuate because they are pure speculation until proven otherwise TLDR  Stocks are like eggs    drop them from too high and they break  Crypto is like a bouncy ball  the higher and faster it drops the larger the bounce is 0 0865 BNB great explanation  i might be stupid but I have one question  When you provide liquidity  do you earn something if you don t put your LP token in a pool or farm Im sure ETH will be around for a long long time But  I can tell you I ve stopped using it   ‍ ️ The gas fees are nuts so hold my stash and avoid anything erc20  Too many faster and cheaper options now I am really not sure when a good entry would be since I suspect it will consolidate If you re that way inclined you can do locked up staking on Binance  They re currently offering 34  APR for a 15 day lockup for a max of 20 SOL can you send whitepaper   what is the price pre sale of sos I think many will be surprised Copyright 2020 Solana Foundation  Licensed under the Apache License  Version 2 0

buyers than sellers It could be fomo as no other reasonable explanation so far Solana price is increasing because people are buying it I can t speak for everyone  but can speak for myself  I haven t held any crypto in about 4 years  and I held very little even back then  I recently heard about DEX from a programmer friend  and I asked him  how is it possible to put every order on the block chain  can t proof of work only do like 1 transact sec at huge electricity cost    He then tells me that Solana can do  gt 10K transacts second  The fact Solana solves a real problem that enables new applications  coupled with recent price action  and decorrelation to BTC  convinced me to buy Solana Exodus and Solana combo is giving me so much hope  Staking it for 10 4  is noiceeee I m curious about these answers as well    looks like on GitHub solana has a copyright  Does that mean it s not open source  Would surprise me if true   I hold a little sol FYI and am interested in the ecosystem There isn t a minimum Its gone 26x just this year  I cant believe people are still longing this  We are going to see a healthy pull back soon Threw the kitchen sink at this stock and then some  To the moon Thanks for the tip   I checked it up   A bit to complicated for me  Just have to practice my dicipline it seems  Sol is not comming to a halt   Big news might be annonced on 28th   And people knowing what it is   Is on a buying frenzy it seems You are suppose to feel spooky  that s when the money can be made  If you feel hyped that s time to sell and why people buy it now I m going deep on SOL Monday morning once wires clear Don t care what the price is  2 year hold minimum I thing keeping portion forever and stake it seems a good idea Sell part and stake the rest probably  Crypto is very volatile  But I am holding for a long time Comparing by market cap   Solana would need to equal  1000 to equal Ethereum at  2200 Would you rather sell or keep It all and live of staking rewards Accurate Just bought a fair bag of SOL a few days ago and I must say I m currently enjoying my stay I need it to come down What price 10x from where     10x from now  3rd in market cap  maybe but unlikely atm    10x from ICO  already far past that If you forgot it  it s probably too minimal for you to notice Shakepay is the best way to buy BTC ETH in Canada by far  https   shakepay me r XH0DOU7  https   shakepay me r XH0DOU7 Buy ETH on shakepay and send it to  FTX com  https   FTX com  and convert to SOL Scam Ser 100 is FUD  No Fud in this Reddit  please Haha that s good Awesome Because people are buying it Nice  if it hits  800 I could retire in my 30s and never work again   hope we all make it Bought some Solana a while back to activate a trust wallet and forgot it was there  Best trade ever Here for the 10x  People don t even know i sure hope so lol i havent had any issues though Since I suffer of chronic FOMO  I always buy NOW LOL mark Honestly  the best is if you have or acquire the tech skills to use a command line wallet and stake from there  Is tedious enough that you will not transfer often  Obviously if you do this transfer a small amount first to confirm it works I don t think that is the reason of going up at the moment  There are a lot of other valuable assets that not increasing so the reason must be different  any other suggestions as I m also wondering  I ve started considering to buy when it was 30 40  cheaper a few days ago but since then just increasing What the minimum amount required to stake I use blockfolio  Verification only takes name and birthdate I think then you can deposit with a debit card and instant buy  Wire transfer verification takes a bit longer 800 Can you double check your returns   Alot of wallets and staking software based on Solana are claiming 10   returns  but I think returns are actually lower   I d be interested in knowing what people are are  really  earning  and how the wallet staking software is representing this You think it s safe  That s my only concern lol I do not want to lose my bag lol Yeah I just can t imagine ADA going over  3 and I had doubled already so I said f it This is crazy  i was going to invest at 36 12 dollars   but the cash was to slow to enter the race  but when it was at 42 26 i thought  fuck it i DO know it is all time high  but it IS a good product and I believe inn it  lets go  and now it is 46 60  lets roooll baby Solana the sun godess lets go Ban Thank you  I ll have to set up an account with one of them That s where all my solana is staked at 11 I m using moonlet  no ledger FTX us  binance us  i think gemini has it Interesting   thanks for the input Gotcha Dumped Ada for sol Anyone tell me where I can buy SOL I don t know but it s freakin awesome  One of my fav coins and has an awesome 11  staking on exodus At what price would you stop buying The Ecosystem its building along with the vision of SBF will replace traditional exchanges  making DEX styles the only game in town and will lead the progression to a fluid frictionless liquidity exchange for assets  gt  lt  value  BTC is down and the usually connected ALTs are with it  some exceptions  but ultimately we are at a stage that even if BTC does correct more towards 40k  good projects that have real use cases and are actively usable or making regular releases will hold up well if not grow even in a downturn  SOL and the ecosystem is making lots of growth 1  If it is hidden and never show in explorer  then I m sure we couldn t find out  same goes to all the other blockchain project

loading more Intelligent flow money Got in at  4 and have been DCA since   woke up this morning to a new high   Still kicking myself for selling ETH early  Going to hold  hodl  hold SOL Dumped all my AAVE and ADA for SOL  I d dump more if everything wasn t down Fair point   just when you look at the screen you see only those 2 in the green Let s be honest here  DOGE is in its own corner that no one compares with  DOGE does not have a cap  Most cryptos will be going up in the future long term wise as crypto is taking over the world  I have made money on DOGE however  that actually is a great long term investment Hello  What s the current  Rewards  thanks Thank u everyone  my sol is comback  i very happy  Cheer solana Fastest blockchain in use today with smart contacts  Everyone else is still theoretical or in the works If you owned Ether right now at  2 200 Would you care if you bought it at  40 or  45 widevpn  suport wireguard  unblock any content Definitely not DOGE vibes   cant compare to a pump and dump type of volatility bc you can see theres never been dumps  except that 1 recent crash but bounced back more quickly than ever I just unstaked mine the other day  It shows a zero balance but after two days my solana was there Lmfao doge went up 200  in 24hrs  Sol has seen 200  in a month after a large correction  What about solana gives you doge vibes Kind of the opposite of an ape  I m an ape I can t answer these questions unfortunately maybe there is upcoming good news  like coinbase listing Can t believe no one has said this  use a vpn and create a binance  not US  account  Just make sure to never log in to your account while not connected to the vpn  After you buy  immediately transfer your sol off the platform Thanks  Price is in theory unlimited indeed but if you look at the movement it had this year and its position compared to projects that have been in the top 10 for years and have a lot more adoption and community then this is a no brainer short for the coming days  Expecting a 20 30  drop Huh What a friendly welcome  you are very nice That way you will never make any substantial money Because it just works and you can verify it by yourself  It s not a roadmap Wish you luck dude  Shorting is really hard  You have huge unlimited risk  price is unlimited  and very limited reward  price can t go below 0   Been there and made a lot of money thanks to short sellers  TSLA Go do your own research you ape  Stop living at the expense of others The only reasonable way to reinvest is too buy related tokens which weren t running and they should  Like SRM  That s what I did with profits from my SOL trades  SRM  amp  SOL are dependent on each other That s why I bought SRM  My SRM position is bigger than SOL  We ll see the same run with it as with SOL  It is a bargain below or around 6 USD Hah  it s all love  Waiting too long to buy in on a coin that you like in hopes of a dip is a part of investing in crypto that everyone goes through yea iv been trying to get me some  will have to wait for a drop Nice layout and appreciate the info but wanted more  particularly on delving further in to the projects that are using SOL Try Moonlet   Use with Ledger   11 62  APY right now I feel personally attacked for sure Yeah the browser has a lot to do with it  I use Chrome  Glad you got it done  It just doesn t work as  steadily  as it should  especially the connect disconnect but in the end it gets things done This is the way So to take money from US  dollars in a credit card to SOL in the Sollet  what is presently the simplest way At what price should I buy in  Wait for it to dip to which pricepoint or buy now no such thign as sucx or not SOL does have some big investers in it  but this is a great sign  The other day when the market dropped due to the stuff in the U S  SOL went up  To me this shows the whales are not only investing it in   they believe in it and are holding One particular investor has been pumping millions into all Dapps that come onto SOL as well  hence why we are seeing most of it s Dapps really pumping right now  just look at TERRA go   I just wish I had more money lol  SOL will just keep rising and the project is ready to take over now with wormhole out  If I had money for their Dapps I d be buying up those as well while they are cheap    but VET is on a big sale right now so can t help myself  P gt d Everstake and they ve had thousands of small stake accounts delegated to them continuously for days weeks nowWhen the Exodus wallet first launch feature to SOL staking  all these stakes go to Everstake  hence they got alot of small account  I remember that day I try staking in Exodus and Everstake was charging 0  fees  after 1 day they start charging 8  fees   My guess is the program of Exodus will now delegate users SOL to other validator for better fees Do you think the price increases because Sol IA not on a lot of exchanges and there is no BTC SOL pairings The orignal anti yoda bot may have given up but I too hate you Fake Yoda Bot  I won t stop fighting            I am also fighting to unsuspend and  u coderunner1 so join the fight with me                    On behalf of u coderunner1 I mean I would say you have already made money on it since buying it  Solana is a very hot token at the moment and I seriously think we can take over ETH   100 is a very realistic baseline I could see for this year    and years to come  well let s not spoil the surprise Can you somehow do a highquality 1920x1080 version to use for wallpaper engine  I m so inlove with this design    lt 3 My take on it   solana did not have overleveraged accounts with crazy 50x  100x  150x margins that got called last weekend  nor any whales that wanted to take profits on biden s tax announcementBoth bullish signs to me SOL and  COPE both saving my portfolio Let s be real  there is sooo much shit out there right now Look at all the meme coins and friends with multi billion dollar market caps  I

SMASH THE UPVOTE if you like Sleeping giant I ve been trading everything for Solana I just bought some solana so good time to exit I feel like it s about to leg up I got in at 2 35 and I m   ever since SOLANAs Performance is just an epic dream  I just dont get why not all human beings bought it OMG I did it I did all steps  for some reason the tab balance  beside trade on top  does not show up in my chrome but it shows on brave browser  I was doing the settling in the balance tab under the order book  In that balances on top there is a button settling all  this one worked  Could also be luck of trying many time but this button worked first try    So now it work 2 time in a row    Man Brave was not even in the list of working browser  just did that cuz I searched the telegram and someone said the brave browser might have help him    amp  x200B Thanks Oh darn  Hope they come soon  D  fees on the ERC 20 network costs an arm and a leg by the way I was not comparing it to doge   all i ask is i know what drives doge price right now  but sol i cant understand  sol is not the only good project around and they all got beaten b c BTC  why not sol I was not comparing it to doge   all i ask is i know what drives doge price right now  but sol i cant understand  sol is not the only good project around and they all got beaten b c BTC  why not sol Its really sad to see some coins only go up in value because of hype and because they have been around for long  Some might say the same for Ethereum but at least it has a humongous ecosystem and TVL to show for it  Ada has nothing as of now but still valued at 40B  but then again if Dogecoin can be valued at 48B then anything is possible I m in at  35  Its about 4  of Etherum s market cap  In other words  everyone is getting in cheap atm Disclaimer  not financial advice  reinvest a portion of what you earn A month ago I heard about Solana and didn t pay attention  I was like  please not another token    couple days did my research about it and my first thought was  shit    Been waiting for a dip but ended FOMOing at 38 because this thing seems to move at its own will What do u mean by taking a profit  How exactly True    I don t often see comments about Solana on the other subs platforms  Few I think have heard of Solana but it s rising quickly Yeah I tried  again following every steps same problem   error settling Funds  Transaction failed  Instruction  InitializeAccount   I added usdt as coin  allow blind sign is enable  I tried to restart  also I tried firefox instead of chrome  but it would not work  I still have sol coin in wallet to pay for the transaction  I use a ledger X  I have been on that problem for hours now  Sol rit now is maybe like bsc 8 month ago  Thanks for the help  only scammer in solana or solflare telegra  atm Reckon they are probably testing it out before rolling it out to the whole Kik messenger  It was confirmed by the Kin foundation that kin will be implemented inside Kik within 2 weeks and that was a week ago so would line up well with the final testing phase When did that happen exactly   There was a market and noticeable increases in transactions on the Solana network about a week ago   I have been trying to figure out what it was   Could be this if it went live a week ago Exactly like why are people still comparing sol to doge  I actually take solace in that in some ways   it shows we are a long way off the top well said doge would die in a heartbeat of Elon stops pumping it  No tech behind it no fundamentals  Amazing network effect sustained by a funny billionaire that s all because when things cool off people start seeing the value in a world of memes  Solana reminds me of the binance coin when it hit 45 dollars and then nothing stopped it while people  waiting for the pullback kept on waiting I wouldn t say it s acting against the market  It s just outperforming the market  If BTC was going up  SOL would just be up even more It s giving doge vibes   but that s because it has massive potential and could disrupt the financial sector  Imagine if we run a Nasdaq sized order book on a daily basis  Is doge going to do this  or anything for that matter Sol it s own beast continue surprising  people how well it performs    not  me I feel like it s going to shock a lot of people Yep  that s it  I looked at SolFlare  To use it with a Ledger  do I need to install the app on Ledger Live Why is Solana performing so well  Just discovered it and would like to understand Don t think so  They re just undergoing maintanence right now I agree   but in this environment it is spoky  gives you the doge kind of vibe Not to be an ass but enjoy those losses bud Because it s massively undervalued ada is the charlatan coin of the crypto space  empty promises from the unlikeable Charles Hoskinson whatever his name guy Why sol acting against the market constantly on a long period   In stock market this is a sign of manipulation Today maybe we are enjoying this but tomorrow You might need to go DeFi  Have you tried raydium or serum gt  personally never buy pumps  I always by sideways or just after a dip seems to be done  I make 0 2 Sol a dathank you I needed that in a world of doge fanatics  I myself being one uuuggh those pumps screw with my head I enjoyed this article  Straight to the point and very informative  Even learned from it despite already owning  SOL But its also fun to ride the doge for a while Solid advice  always spread your buys so you can determine the average codt per sol  Make a clear strat on when to buy and stick to it  eg 4x once each week  4x once each day or even 4x once each month Chances are you get bith a dip and ath but still come out on top in average Nice article and a clear presentation on how it works  why it works and why it will continue to work I am short since yesterday  Its up 26x since the start of the year without any real pull back  Every indicator is screaming oversold  Target around 25   to hop back in Buy BTC on Coinbase and send it to Coinex and buy SOL there  Also from NY and that s what I found worked I used uphold We have closed the ranks and are waiting for reinforcements  SIR Best way I think it s Kin coin getting integrated inside Kik messenger  Kin runs on the Solana blockchain and kik messenger has 10mil monthly active users  Which would make Solana the most used blockchain in the world afaik no  u could ask on the discord and someone more knowledgeable could help you  i just use solflare Where to stake Sol safely Thanks  I will take a look at the memo program  I tried my luck in discord channel  But there was no response  Frankly if the documentation could be revamped it would in itself give a booster to the sol rocket if u send me ur sollet sol address I can send you a small amount of SOL and u can use wormhole to transfer eth to solana  then u can exchange eth for sol on raydium What is this shit buidl it  no you should      Mysterious_Media_840      Commands   opt out    delete no you should buidl  it should I buy now  it seems high   or wait for a dip You can buy btc on Coinbase  send it to ftx us  sell it into sol  send it to your Sollet wallet  Pretty sure that s possible  Vpn works wonders I might not be as low as we hoped   If it hits 35  again I will buy   But some reason it is on it s own bullrun while all others are bearish Ok  many seem to think so   But is that enough reason for parabolic unstoppable growth when the whole market is bearish Try to do the following 1  Disconnect from SolFlare and SolFlare DEX2  Unplug Ledger 3  Plug Ledger back  enter pin  and exit re enter the Solana app on Ledger and make sure the  Allow Blind Sign  is allowed in the app settings4  Close browser and reopen the SolFlare DEX only  not SolFlare Wallet 5  Now that you are logged in go to the Balances tab6  Use the  Settle All  in the Balances tab  not any other Settle button 7  report back  amp  x200B I got mine to work that way  The DEX is very buggy but does its job it seems and is a nice way to get SPL tokens HODL  The Line Buy now and stake same here Solana doesnt dip mate people are buying and holding  I suggest buying asap I use SafePal app wallet  If you get it then you can activate binance inside of the app and get instant verification  I m able to trade on binance marketplace and everything  I have been waiting for my binance us app to get verified for a couple weeks but now that I discovered this feature I just use it instead Check out https   raydium io for good sol ecosystem pools https   ftx us  a 2951514 I feel the same way FTX will be best place for SOL and SOL related projects  Here s referral link for discount in fees  https   ftx us  a 2951514 Ditto on VPN  I use expressvpn but same idea   pick the exchange you like that has sol  connect via VPN  make an account  send whatever crypto is cheap on fees  Litecoin was a suggestion   trade for sol  send to private wallet I think its going to be another hackathon Don t forget to take some profits while we re at it Bought in originally at  2 and kept buying in throughout all of the 2nd half of last year  with an average price of  1 20  As soon as I read up on it I knew this could actually be a serious eth competitor  I ve made so many bad decisions since 2017  feels good to have made a good one gt https   solana com en ecosystem oxygenNothing wrong specially since RAY is native to Raydium  so just swap it there  Best way IMO is buy SOL on FTX Binance  transfer to your sollet  swap SOL to RAY on  Raydium io  https   Raydium io    Once you have SOL in your sollet or other SOL wallet  you shouldn t need to go back to ETH chain  If you think you do  think about it for a minute and you ll figure out another way  E g  Serum DEX seems quite liquid  prices are not as bad for SOL USDT or SOL USDC compared to Binance  However Raydium is still pretty inefficient for such pairs  So  once you have SOL  use Raydium Swaps for RAY or any Raydium specific tokens pools  but for stablecoins and general trading swapping  Serum should be fine  I guess bonafida too though I haven t tried it gt https   discord com invite pquxPsqgood job MisterFeeshy I was looking into Solana for a couple days and I got impatient in the end and bought some today  Probably wasn t the wisest thing to do    but fook it Buy NordVPN  Cost  12 or something  Super easy to use  Buy Litecoin via Crypto com  It has the cheapest fee for instant debit buys  Withdraw the Litecoin to Binance and trade it for USDT and buy Solana  Send the Solana to a wallet like  Trust Wallet Nope  NY is on the same level as North Korea Citizens and residents of Washington State U S A   New York State U S A   Cuba  Iran  North Korea  Sudan  Syria Pakistan  the Government of Venezuela  and Crimea are not supported Same problem  i added usdt and wrapped usdt but I cannot settle SOL or USDT  The telegram is mainly scammers it seems Unfortunately  no Nope  Can t get SOL in NY on Exodus  It s honestly almost impossible to get in NY True  It was the first place I was able to find Solana  Still waiting to get verified on Binance Exodus buy Bitcoin   swap for SOL thanks for your time and effort on the spreadsheet  stumbled upon this looking for the same info Any idea where are all those SOL transactions are coming from They teased something about doing another hackathon a month ago so I wouldn t be surprised to see it be something like a 1 million dollar hackathon this time https   twitter com solana status 1385282156809781249 I ve used FTX us to buy SOL as a NY resident  I didn t have to do kyc  While I suppose there could be some limitations if I don t KYC  I was able to buy a small stack and withdraw from FTX without any issue Look into https   eleven finance   They offer autocompounding leveraged yield farming on BSC and are about to add SOL support Exodus showing 10 49 Wow wall street holds a lot of power in NY doesn t it   Power corrupts     and ultimate power     well  you know One thing to do is to play with the solana command line client   It mostly gives you a representation of what you can get from the JSON API   For example   solana block  will show you the contents of the most recent block I have written a program for my own uses that reads stake accounts and parses out the contents   The stake program stores details of stake accounts and these details are available to anyone who can parse the JSON API if you dig a bit   I had to read the solana source code to see how they did it and mimic that Do both  Buy some now and wait for the dip Where can I stake it for that Project serum
2021-04-26,47.54185509,48.31078375,43.37172735,U can try PPAY    great project  Still very early Do you think the tokens like  RAY   FIDA  and  COPE are solid longterm investment as well And what about the people who live in Vermont  Texas  New York  Louisiana  Idaho  Hawaii or CT     Binance us  https   Binance us  doesn t serve the entire country fyi look at the graph of Eth in march of 2017 You mean while Solana was is gaining Who said I don t have BTC and ETH  I have multiple wallets  Don t put all of your eggs in one basket Hbar is total trash Any portfolio without at least some BTC is not a good idea in my opinion  I would add ETH to the list as well but something tells me that advice wouldn t be well received Invest in a hedge fund like Mulitcoin   http   multicoin capital  http   multicoin capital   and you ll get into these kinds of deals early  I got into Solana at  0 44 whalepool io Let s put it like this  if you have researched the project properly  you d know that it can one day take some market share away from eth  Eth is at  2 500 sir Great picks   also API3 as a platform oracles play  Different approach that is a big improvement on cost  transparency  ease of use for non crypto native data providers than Chainlink offers  Big fan of both projects Following No no  thats obvious  i mean why in the past two weeks solana was performing completelly different than the rest  Whats so special about solana SOL is also proof of stake as opposed to Proof of work  think bitcoin mining  so you can stake your SOL and earn more SOL by doing so In it to win it Same here Like any sector in tech  speed wins  Ethereum currently handles about 15 transactions per second  TPS   while Solana is capable of more than 1 000 TPS TPS   transactions per secondOhhh and the fees are exponentially lower  Eth gas fees are absolutely ludicrous Good god   This is very beta for a 12 billion   market cap isn t it    I had the same issue  Because MAX doesn t allow for the fee  That s pretty much wallets 101 I m having the same problem being from NY  I will try one of these methods though  thanks for everyone s input  NY sucks for crypto purchases This is really interesting  Very promising for the future of Serum  I always have reservations about ALT projects after a bull market considering how many disappeared after 2017 and screwed me over  Let s hope times have changed  This gives me confidence No Avoid this  It s a scam  You will be asked to click through to a link  Same user is posting to multiple subs under different names  Check the Ops profile and see for yourself  Straight up link phishing As a VET holder  As a SOL holder https   github com solana labs solana blob master LICENSE  https   github com solana labs solana blob master LICENSE арпар That depends on what ETH presents in the coming QTR  They do compliment each other tho Solana was down for a long time now it s its time to shine you ve got some money moves dang yes Diversification is for people who don t know what they are doing  You can t research well many projects at once  Pick one or two and focus on researching them on daily basis Honeymustardw is correct  It s Exodus BTC goes up  SOL goes up  BTC goes down  SOL goes up You think  13  18 was bad  you should have been around during July to January lol  It infuriatingly bounced between  2  4 while everything else mooned  Finally it s Solana s time The best will be when you ll hold for at least 5 years  I sold 13 BTC in 2015   Just stake it and forget Yeah moon talk is for shitcoins bro  SOL doesn t need moon help bullshit  it is better then any other blockchain  and it growing day by day  That s all that matters  I would prefer it to stay cheap as possible for longer so I can keep buying more lol Charles Hoskinson is a Trevor Milton of crypto  You should check what happened to Nikola  NKLA  investors  The same exact playbook   super wide roadmap without substantial execution  founder arrogance and focusing on pumping not on execution  And a lot of meaningless partnerships Exodus No It may drop but don t underestimate snow ball effect  Community is growing like crazy and when it will reach TOP 10 it will accelerate  Especially there is hackathon this week  There are super strong fundamentals in this project and it s not like Cardano   no roadmap valuation tech is here Please  let s not become a Moon community  Solana is a solid project with great fundamentals  We don t need diamonds hands and to the moon bullshit  PS  I m an owner of 2 GME shares  this doesn t pretend to put down all investing memes  but usually these memes become toxic in the crypto because they displace real discussion about the project  attracting super especulative investors who are going to fly away as soon as they feel the sentiment has changed  I usually sell my crypto when the community is posting about mooning and holding instead of about the project Bitcoin is the first of its kind and sets an example for other cryptos   when bitcoin performs well  it instills confidence in other cryptos Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day

support ticket  No response  My status for the transaction is submitted   15th April Another way to help diversify but stay with Solana if you like is buying into projects that run on the Solana network  Some notable ones would be Chainlink  platforms oracle   Serum  Dex   Anchor  a user friendly savings account   BAND  data aggregation oracle   Audius  a music app to help the creators of music   RAMP  Defi   Raydium  AMM   TERRA  stablecoin eco   Many others   just some to research in to that I personally think are pretty cool  Again  not advice or anything  just a thought if you felt like diversifying while still kind of support SOL This is the way So frigin cool man  Like not only is Solana pumping but literally most of the projects who use them are as well  I don t know what s going on I just wish I had more money haha Les goooooo Same  got 12    14 lol Agreed  That s a lot of money to have focused on one coin Bro you must be loaded    Class gains why not try to use p2p trading on finance  is it forbidden in your country I think you ll find he s being hyperbolic My portfolio is currently 80  SOL3L lolProbably time to diversify any way to view charts on Solana s network tokens like Serum  Raydium  STEP Just checked them out While they do have followings i wouldn t say they have enough to artificially manipulate market  amp  increase the price   lot more activity into SOL than their combined following for example What app do you use to stake Yes Personally I see Soloana as a long term investment  5 years  Not in for the quick buckeroo  So I don t care about the bulls and So I saw some guys talking about why the Solana blockchain might be the next big thing and if the current pump is just a baseless fomo or people are actually starting to believe in it  well it s a bit of both but I m currently in it because of the blockchain not for a quick few bucks grab  I discovered this chain and it s potential around January and I ve been pushing for it recently got my account back on reddit so now I can just post this The picture above idk if it s clear enough for you guys shows the TPS  Avg TX fee  finality time  total transaction between the top blockchains and that should show you just how much a big threat it is  I can t really put everything into words but there are plenty of videos and articles about the team and what s coming soon  So I strongly suggest you guys should pay attention to this project and see what it s capable of This means that you must get permission from Solana to use the code  This is not very similar to the philosophy of crypto Hear hear i checked serum and raydium and i use everything on raydium Don t ask here  this is full of fans that have little knowledge about the blockchain technology you just need to read the answers  The comparison with ADA in terms of price is absurd Guys check out LUKSO  LYXe  soon to be  LYX  https   lukso network about Guys check out LUKSO  LYXe  soon to be  LYX  https   lukso network about Add LUKSO  LYXe  soon to be  LYX That s a very ignorant thing to say  What s with the tribalism Yep definitely wise words  No matter how exciting it is  there s no guarentee s in life and diversity is always good I m not sure if there s a  comparison table  as such  but all blockchains speeds are available for all to see  I think NEO is one of the closest to solana s speed   and that does 10k TPS   Solana can do over 50k    verified I love this coin and I love this tech but    be careful and dont invest money you cannot afford to lose Good for you I d still recommend diversifying a little more  though  As much as we love this project it s generally safer not to put all your eggs in the same basket I m by no means an investment advisor  do your own research and keep your head cool  there will be challenges ahead Congrats  nicely done Do you use a tax software that recognizes FTX A realistic goal for Solana is a natural growth of the coin  Since its not a meme coin  and ETH is a more popular tech  the growth is hopefully going to be steady but solid Dont expect bullish growth such as Doge or at times Storj for example  but dont expect extreme lows either For me Solana is a secure way of long term holding with moderate risk We are adding a lil more today or tomorrow and then its enough  All our FYM is invested and Im not about to invest our savings Awesome dude  This is literally my plan    a y profit I make throw in sol  cope and serum    possibly  luna Yeah Serum is the biggest Defi on the network so worth checking that one out my man Wish I had bought more than 10 SOL when it was around  13    but well Where can I find the comparison table   Thanks Yeah weird you have SOL s far less supiorer rivarlies in your portfolio yes  Cardano have only hughe hype  bc cardano is cheap and every newbie have a vision to buy 1 USD coin and sell for 100 USD  so they are investing  but they have not funcional product yet  I dont wanna blame Cardano  i was holding ADA too  but if they develop what they were promissing  in this time others project will already have strong market position Solana is light years beyond ADA  ADA is a ghost chain shilled by a good salesman that  my friend  is a great question with an even better answer   https   projectserum com blog srm supply  https   projectserum com blog srm supply Damn smart moves esp as a newbie What is up with Serum circulating supply Every crypto is following bitcoin   bitcoin drops  they drop  bitcoin raises  they rise  but solana does its own thing  Can someone elaborate why it is Yes  team basically elite geek in optimizing performance Generous _Media Got it  so Solana are a few steps ahead of Cardano right now cause they already have smart contracts up and working Wow I wasn t even thinking about influencing the network  but you bring a good point to that  I was thinking more about keeping everything running  but you seemed to hit that  too  Considering the fact that Solana is only  what  2yrs old  I guess it s just a matter of time before this gets addressed  I m very excited about everything going on  Thanks for your input  It s very valuable 1300 for this year  I think we will get to 200 in this initial loading stage  second wave after September should take us above 1200 at parabola top Clueless  aren t we Media Network I m jumping on it  just found out about it today What is rate for 30 days How often look at whats going on now  do you think this is the value of sol so it stoped  No everybody else in the green we are in the red   yesterday it was just the opposite clearly there is a pattern here Top signal guys That s nice for you  In my portfolio SOL didn t outperform  100  in February and 100  now oh and don t forget MAPS Just got into crypto a month ago  Bought 15k of doge when it was at  05  Sold when it was at  33  Put all of it into Sol and plan on buying some more every week  When lose or draw I am here to stay nvm i got it Donnycrypto  parabolit  thecryptodog bc solana have a huge functional ecosystem  a lot of projects are working on solana  In Cardano u can trasfer your ADA from exchange into your wallet and thats all haven t seen anyone mention  AUDIO  CRWNY Awh man you gotta get on FTX and sign up asap  Kraken is gonna take forever to get Solana  By that time it s probably  100 or more You guys are thinking too small scale  This may go to  300  500 easily and always remember the whole market especially top 10 will go into multi billions in MCap you use sollet or phantom wallet to bridge eth from metamask  cheers  you ll need a small amount of sol to swap the eth to sol  after u create ur wallet if u send me ur address i will send u enough for the swap  welcome aboard matey I wanted to jump in like a month ago but was just learning and only have Kraken   Unfortunately it was not listed there   Pretty bummed cause its skyrocketed since then Your post has been automatically removed because your

solana  if you have any questions or concerns Everything is ready to go and it s running like ETH in 2017  You can either FOMO in now or when it s  300  500 minimum it is the goldilocks zone between decentralization centralization  it is live  it is fast  it is cheap to transact  it is cheap relative to competitors price wise  it is backed by sbf  it is new  it is branded well  it has high developer growth  it has native usdc usdt support  could go on but this is sufficient SRM  RAY  OXY  STEP  COPE also look at Raydium  curious to see what others suggest as well look at Serum  that might become the pancake uni of Solana  unless something more promising comes along follow Following Good for you lol I wish a daily limit was my problem haha  Someone should figure out a quicker debit to solana buy path though daily limit  I already did  Probably should ve taken it off temporarily though  Thought I could wait lol Awesome  Is there a best chain to transfer from Following Rank 20th to 14th in total market cap in 48 hrs  Huge influx of money  This coins chartered to top 5 coins if this rate is sustainable Yeah I have no idea how they are doing it man but you look at their speed and cost and it just leaves the rest for dead  The other negative thing with ETH is we know the fees currently are extremely high  i ve heard people paying  100 gas fees  could you imagine is it keeps rising in price  What happens when ETH is 10k each  will gas fees be almost 1k each  It just doesn t make sense and isn t a scalable solution in my opinion  And I m not shitting all over Etherium I hold some of it as well and it was the first creater of a blockchain for dapps  but it s model just doesn t make sense the bigger it gets And yeah you have every right to be anxious with alts and bitcoin at the moment it s become quite unstable again recently  That s why it s always wise to diversify between say 5 alts you really love the tech behind and keep some cash aside to buy dips that happen With a hardware wallet your private keys are never exposed to solflare or any other web app that is interacting with it You beat me to it  I bought 440 at 17 Honestly  you don t need the other coins  SOL is going to surpass all by far lol  Not financial advice though  of course Why not buy with ACH or debit credit card on FTX next time  Instant trading No way  just buy SRM on a serum project like raydium io or openserum ch fees are way cheaper and earn SRM for stakers Just a week ago I looked up the top tier blockchain comparison table and I was stunned  50 000 tps with almost zero fees  It s unbelievable  I think we can see Solana a top 10 coin easily by mid may and possibly beat Cardano at market cap since they keep delaying smart contracts  I m fairly new to the Crypto world but learning a lot each day  I m just kind of anxious from all the recent pumps and dumps in Alt coins I totally support Solana  A HODL but not huge yet haha Hope NENGcoin and Cheetahcoin will grow as fast as Solana as we are all making the crypto world better   ️ Forgive me if I ve ready your post wrong   Solana in just one week has gone from  26 to over  46 making it almost double it s value from 7 days  Know for me personally I don t really care about the price for sol so to speak because I want to buy a whole lot more of this and plan on just holding it   but to say it has bearly flinched    when everything else in the market is hitting the lowest lows they have seen for months     is quite off I could see a lot of people buying in as  fomo  sure  that always happen when you see a coin like this pump  But lets not turn away from what we all know     this is a Etherum killer     And some massive tech has been using Solana just building up waiting for something like this to happen  In the next week I could see Solana hitting top 10 which is insane   and then the next step will be gunning for Etherums head  Solana is light years faster  cheaper to the point where if I was a Dapp dev i wouldnt even consider ETH and with Wormhole it has the easy transition off solidarity and straight onto Solana uses many common coding languages dev s currently use So I think people are just starting to see this a the  money push  to finally take over Etherium  Obviously that s a long way away  but Solana is ready  Etherium is still playing catch up with their layer 2 that still won t be as good I ve been watching both heavily  so I put equal amounts in two months ago  Here we are now  SOL running laps on laps around ADA  Sorry Charles but SOL has speed  smart contracts and dapps Thanks Warpbro I was introduced to SOL via Kin Looks like exodus wallet  pretty nice I use it too Although I love the project and I am fully invested in it  it has barely flinch with the corrections  I don t know if people are just buying because FOMO or they understand its potential Raydium io or Serum SRM is listed on gateio exchange now  You wont have to deal with entire networks  binance  crashing when it peaks  By far easiest and cheapest way to buy SRMGate is a top listed trusted exchange on coingecko  Fees are ridiculously small and defi is not easy to buy and sell from  I m from USA verified very easily  Gateio  https   gate io   allows for the person referring to set the rate  so here s my code   30  for you   and I only get 10   https   www gate io ref 3650407  https   www gate io ref 3650407 what app  look sleek Does using a ledger reduce or eliminate the risk of your address being hacked when the web wallet is compromised More buyers than sellers  May not be a good thing  Indicative of 1  people trying to jump on a trending coin at a good price  and that means the price is inflated and will correct  and 2  money moving into SOL away from downward trending coins as a safe temporary place  I d be cautious to jump in this week  Won t be surprised if a big seller dumps and takes their earnings early  Remember  this was just  10 about 60 days ago  If you do buy  buy on the long  2 years Impressive  just impressive my friend Best money move i ever made What a lucky person you are  I wish i have this luck when choosing my coins Good luck Binance 35  for 15 days is mad 80 is a fair price right now for SOL  we can accelerate this if we hit Coinbase next coming days or weeks Ftx or Mandala PROBABLY USDC BEING USED PsyOptions Solana bearly dips ALL IN  On KIN Dang  i envy you mate  Good investment I understand  I m biased so anything I saw should be taken with a grain of salt  but most coins are shit and solana shows promise  I think the market tends to agree atm Congratulations  you re going to be a millionaire lol Keep them for the next months   years  Good catch at those prices gt    So I personally do not see any reason that Solana wouldn t go to  3 in market cap    gt    gt However  I am not buying more Solana   I am just too worried about price corrections  either specifically for Solana or for the market in general  and it s also very easy to fall into the irrational trap of not believing that its current value is sustainable only because you knew it when it was valued a lot less   Which is honestly a bush league investment mindset but I m heavily susceptible to it    gt    gt That being said  I m not selling my holdings either   I bought with the intention of not sellinSuper reasonable outlook for

my 2 sol and other small amount of btc eth and ada into more with such a small balance gt ftx usPlease  do they accept other methods than credit card    Like Perfect Money  Webmoney Try to let go of FOMO and sit back  Do you feel confident about Solana  Do you think that Solana will be around in a year or two  Do you think that the tech behind Solana is good enough to make this a valued asset to the cryptomarket  If so  then its never too late to buy in Welcome to a promising and exciting project which is here to stay I just stumbled upon this and tbh the logo had a lot of pull factor  I then spent time studying the arch and since I have dome some bit of dsp and assembly programming myself  I felt intrigued by how much the founders respected the need for having optimised transactions and programs  That smelled like proper vision on taking over the entire transactions market Also I hate cardano  Having peer reviewed releases is just not sustainable in blockchain world  Say you fuck up a release  do I wait for a peer review to fix it right  No I fix it fast with application of the knowledge I have gathered from my experience Solana is exactly opposite and hence it was love at first sight  I have a 1 5 GHz eth mining rig  I mine and convert to sol every week I also bought at ATH but I m ok with it  It has a long way to go and playing with the SOL network and using Serum has made my conviction go up even more thanks for the reply  there are many complicated jargon in the official developer notes that i do not fully understand so it is very difficult for me to compare  and that really helped me out https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs I was tipped to it on a Nano vs Bitcoin debate  out of all places  When someone mentioned Nano s speed  they said  lol Solana is faster   I got intrigued  researched it  and basically thought of it as the child of Ethereum   Nano  with big money backing  Alameda   I should have bought way more  but staking does make you feel better that it is growing passively Good info  thanks  I m chasing my tail trying to figure out all the wallets I d need to buy these  Suggestions  I don t use CEXs  only DEXs  Thanks I opened an account for me and my GF with the same amount of money around the same time  I made safer bets like BTC and ETH with some alts for her  and in my account I decided to look for coins that grew and ride the candles  Needless to say  her account has made more money and is taking the drops a lot better  If you re looking for something to 10x or more  then that s something that takes some time  look at how long ago some of these people bought their SOL  shit doesn t blow up overnight  There are so many projects that are going to grow as BTC grows  Do some research and pick a couple  if you re willing to hold then chances are you re going to make money no matter what coins you choose  Don t over diversify  that shit will fuck you up  you ll get massive pumps one place that will do very little to affect your pnl  Make bets that you like and wait  And always remember  that it is veeeeeeeery hard to outperform BTC in the long run 404 Comparing SOL to ADA  is there a set interest you get for staking  like a idea how much you would make  What would the coin be used for If you got the cash  one way is obviously do your research  but  sprinkle some funds to projects that you think may grow  Some will  some won t  some may take time   I got in on SOL   14  so not early  but it was mid February and I had just gotten back into crypto after a 2 year hiatus   One thing that I have found interesting about Sol is that it has stair stepped the whole downturn   Others that I have   ONE  ENJ  and VET have not faired as well  Going to hold all of them  Others   like DODO   I got rid of after the lack of guidance or a community that seemed sincere  I also find the price of Sol to be at an uncommon point   I can t wait for it to get to 100  coin so it looks  more normal but SOL is centeralised with very little nodes  Have we seen 1 000 TPS  Also has the network been flooded by usage  We are comparing old tech with new tech  while eth is still developing eth 2 0   I am playing devils advocate as I am interested in SOL but don t have to much of an idea besides high TPS Heard about SOL here  https   discussions app tag blog 11n0mqiz1iefe solana  https   discussions

20Web Scale 20Blockchain I found out about it due to holding kin  Kin migrated from stellar to solana so I decided to see what the move was about and just felt a positive vibe from the community and project and decided to move all my ltc to solana  Best choice I ve made Saddest part is     the colour scheme for the project brought me in to start reading about it  D How do you invest with Multicoin capital  They seem like a solid team and very forward thinking  i like their portfolio and what they re doing Welcome  I found solana a month ago and fell in love with this project  Been good to me so far and have nothing but high hopes for the future of solana First  you want to run a validator  not a miner  Second  the website has a list of recommended specs for doing so Wow Yes  all VC work that way  Most of the project die  few of them survive and carry 99  profit I m just getting started  and it s tough  You actually have to do research and read through the white papers to see what is bs and what is not underneath all the esoterism Honestly I don t have a method for this  because I m a TA guy My first purchase of SOL is simply betting on SBF much clever than me  so I just diversify my portfolio to Sam coin The learning part start much later lol Crypto is the future There has been a lot of discussion on crypto pages about this crypto since the original white paper in 2017 outlining the high speed and low transaction cost  As it went through testing and development it was written up  and it had an ICO  auction at a low price  Now it is booming Chad on the right is SBF I appreciate all the advice  My issue is I am an uneducated construction worker that got lucky with timing the doge move  Was hoping that it stayed low a little longer because I wanted to put more in before it ran  I have been doing some research and reading but as far as for in a personal level  nobody I work with knows what crypto is  Lol  They all look at me funny when I talk about it BTC Cardano was initially released in 2015  it s been 6 years and they still haven t released a mainnet  They have 0 decentralized apps built on it and no value locked in the ecosystem  since there currently isn t one  I understand bullishness on ATOM  DOT  ETH  SOL  and even AVAX  But could you please explain how ADA hasn t completely dropped the ball and missed out on a huge networking effect that is being stolen by other L1 s since they have actual products to use and Cardano doesn t  This isn t a jab by any means I m just genuinely curious how people are so bullish and committed to Cardano DCA Even better DCA on min  6  daysInvest what you can loose Buy and HODL for years Stake it to earn on you holdings Coinbureau on youtube  Made a video over 6 months ago  Also  look for good founders for new projects There s a saying from the stock market that goes  time in the market beats timing the market  and that s something I try to stick to when it comes to longterm investments  Solana could easily keep going up to 65 before a dip down to 55  which would still be higher than it s at today  Or the dip could come tomorrow  You don t really know so you might aswell buy now or else you risk sitting on the fence for too long watching what you feel is a good investment just increasing in price  That s my philosophy Let s be real  there is sooo much shit out there right now Look at all the meme coins and friends with multi billion dollar market caps  I mean   really To me this project here is an exceptionally brisk refresher from all the shilly shit I think they are just incredibly bad at marketing so far  so I am helping out  oh hi  but from what I can tell the project looks remarkably profound and high potential   ‍ ️ Yes  but maybe few percent of security vs 1000x of speed tradeoff yes Apologies  Not too sure   but its ability to perform well despite the dip is promising I feel some of it is the market seeing SOL making gains so they FOMO d on  If this is the case  they may just be short term investors unless they like the continued growth or they read up about it more  There s also been heavy institutional backing into SOL Realistically anyone who understands SOL believes it is undervalued   therefore they don t mind buying it when the price is up a few    Just my two cents It happened to me once  I just did it again  and it worked DCA  invest what you can loose  HODL strong  Stake that shit  Good luck oh yes  im a long time investor  im holding long time if i buy this Can t say we expect   we HOPE Comparable market share Sol would be  1000 actually price is  correlating with the price of ETH in 2017  we can expect  similar situation Fack me man I definitely did  Trying to be too smart  Had sol at  1 8  And a good enough number of SOLs  Was smart enough to understand tech  fool enough to not be able to use to my advantage Copyright    Closed source You can read the code on gh  So source is pretty much open I followed one rule last month  Mine eth   gt  swap to sol  Tried ray LP stuff   hated it  Now just hodl sol Not sure I agree with this mate  There s loads of good crypto projects  Yeah Solana has been booming recently but always have to cover yourself incase it bursts  Alternatively  you can look for the next Solana type ROI Where can you buy kin in the usa Thanks LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO I was just laughing bro lol There are many differences but the most relevant for me are   Cardano has an SSI  whether it succeeds or not who knows  It is complemented with metadata for transaction kyc validation  not totally aware on the trade offs of this aspect and the tokenized kyc approach serum took   Cardano aims to scale horizontally  Solana aims to scale vertically  Scaling vertically always finds a limit   Cardano doesn t have smart contracts yet  Solana does  Cardano is more advanced in decentralized governance than solanaTo me the only real downside of Solana is the lack of plan to scale horizontally  SMB himself has said transactions need to scale a lot more which by depending on vertical scaling will be a problem This isn t entirely true   In the blockchain world  security and decentralization are just as important as speed   At this time  Ethereum offers vastly more security than SOL    ETH 2 0 will have over 100k validators   It s unclear how secure SOLs blockchain will be  but right now it uses delegated PoS with less than 1000 validators   That is not as secure   There are tradeoffs Copyright 2020 Solana Foundation  Licensed under the Apache License  Version 2 0  the  License   you may not

It depends on your time horizon  Are you just going to dump it in a week or a month if the gains don t continue  If so  who knows if it s a good time  But if you care about the long run enough to buy

rust blockchain news at the following https   rustinblockchain org newsletters a few tweaks Outright misinformation and FUD question   I m going to report it I believe it s a  1 million minimum now  You ll have to contact them Solaris   im in no rush I bought around  1  I first read about it in Cointelegraph last June  It was just mentioned in passing  but it said  50k TPS  and I was like  what    So I read the docs and realized it was a project with legitimate tech GMI One of these chains is seeing development and one of them is not  To answer your question more specifically  see my answer above OP is an IOTA bag holder  Who thinks needing an Apache license makes a project closed source   https   en wikipedia org wiki Apache _License  https   en wikipedia org wiki Apache_License thanks for the comparison and article but i don t see anything regarding cardano in comparison  am i right to take it that both are essentially similar to one another It isn t because it s not even true  The source code is available on Github  and it s released under the Apache license Is there a Serum Reddit community going I don t believe in DOT anymore  I keep some in case  but well comme amount to nothing If after looking at that link  your conclusion is Solana is  closed sourced   I m sorry but your not gonna make it The Apache license is a permissive open source license   I m not sure how you figure it s closed source at all unless I m missing something Here is a picture of comparison  https   miro medium com max 2538 1 ou7cIGlkRFUr2Z300r8OFQ png  amp  x200B  From this article  https   sinoglobalcap medium com why we are bullish on solana c2be784cfdf6 My guess and that your order didn t fill  price of your limit order didnt hit so there were no takers   In which case you would have an open order on the books and just need to cancel it and your sol would return  Other than that idk  But on the trading tab it wouldn t let you place the order without a usdc wallet  it returns an error so I don t think that is the issue Just research  research  research on reddit  Youtube  etc    with a skeptical eye at all times   and only buy projects you find that a  you believe in the idea  b  meet solid metrics  Coin Bureau on Youtube has a  How to DYOR  video that could get you started  and c  haven t pumped recently  Almost all signs point to the bull run continuing so solid projects that haven t had big runs in the last two months may be due I concur  doctor I tried settling it  it didn t do anything   It s strange because when I did the limit order  it added the USDC token in my Sollet wallet but with 0 balance  there was any amount to settle  If I sent you the transaction hash would you be able to check if it was sent to a new address at all If Lukso hits  280    same bro   same I know next to nothing about Daniel Latimer  but I thought I should balance the debate    gt   Steve Jobs      Bill Gates   and Mark Zuckerberg all left college before they could collect their diplomas  Peter Thiel even encourages talented students to   drop out   of college by funding a scholarship that awards recipients with  100 000 if they quit  https   www cnbc com 2017 05 10 10 ultra successful millionaire and billionaire college dropouts html  https   www cnbc com 2017 05 10 10 ultra successful millionaire and billionaire college dropouts html Some market share  Solana is going to take the whole slice lol  ETH is slow  expensive and so behind what Solana can already do it s not funny  If I was a project looking for a blockchain right now Solana is the most attractive by far You don t need marketing in crypto  Just look at bitcoin  a tech company that hit 1 trillion dollars in 12 years with no marketing  never been done before  When you have a quality product  your fan boys and fan girls do the marketing for you  This thing can  and I think it will  be bigger then Etherium  So I look at Solana at anything under  100 as a fire sale where I need to own as much as possible before to many more people push the price up more lol im starting to think that myself I m not sure if you know what sarcasm is  anyways 100  agree with the bottom statementBuy what you believe in I used to read some news sites  Coindesk  Cointelegraph  amp  Decrypt  daily that in my opinion have a bit more of quality approach to their articles  and I also like to read the info sections on coinmarketcap on some coins   Sometimes I start reading the whitepapers or at least the project presentations  helps too I am looking for    Do I roughly understand what they are doing    Do I roughly understand whether they are offering a solution to an actual problem  that even may be unique   This way  I picked three projects I find interesting   Solana  because of the Proof of History   Verifiable Delay Function technology that seemed to be a technical solution to higher network efficiency   Arweave  as I guess there is a need for cloud storage that is uncensorable  very interesting for people who want to ensure their freedom of speech  or want to be able to proove publicly that they had an idea first   permanent and without any need for regular payments  Paying once  stored forever  I believe there is a huge market for that   Helium  amp  Helium Network Token  HNT   as the Helium Network is building something  real    a decentralized global radio network for Internet of Things devices     There are things that seem to have potential  but haven t been turned in an economically viable project  E g  I do donate a lot of computing time for Folding home  distributed volunteer computing for academic basic medical research  and I am baffled that no one has turned this in a successful cryptoproject yet  I would like to see some kind of Proof of useful work consensus algorithm  Just imagine if all that PoW computing power that is   except  securing the respective networks    wasted on Bitcoin  or Doge Mining would be used to solve ACTUAL research problems Haven t been invested much in Solana before all these locked up Sols were freed into the market in January  as I had no idea how that would affect the price of  SOL  Multiplying the free float could have led to fractioning of the Sol price  Was quite surprised it didn t happen This project is my first dive into the SOL ecosystem  I was late to the airdrop but I joined the meme contest  I hope I win so I can join in on the fun The new doge of solana   samo Absolute beast I m a supporter of the official unofficial meme coin of Solana   SAMO to the moon  not financial advice just a samoyed fan I received this airdrop too  This is definitely more than doge cause doge didn t have this much engagement the new doge coin  solana armies So this project just launched on the Solana network about 30 minutes ago and there was an airdrop before the launching so basically it s a meme coin but based on the Solana network and a total of 1 000 000 SAMO was airdropped to participants that was listed on the raydium DEX at 6  but is worth 140  now and pumping  I hold a few bags myself but I see this going bunkers based on the sol hype so I m holding for a while   I ll be dropping the discord channel link and telegram channel link below  Don t miss out on this gem I shop with my eyes first  then I do research I m right there with you Thanks Don t kick yourself  I bought it super early in the spare of the moment  I can claim I m an investing genius but I seriously didn t know it d pick up like this haha Binance through SafePal is Dencentralized and built into the App on your phone not just a defi app Not really sure what you mean by that Im interested in this project looks solid all around The only reason not to stake SOL is if you expect to use it for transaction fees or sell it within the next few days   So if you are trying to hedge your bets and be ready to sell some at a moment s notice  then you can keep that part unstaked   If you are in it for the long term  then you should keep it staked I hope you don t think that the APY you get depends on when you staked   Everyone gets the same payout every epoch  about 2 5 days   the only difference being how well your validator performed  and how much commission it charged   But if you stake now and the network gets tuned and runs epochs faster  your APY will go up along with everyone else s As far as point 7  They are just joking with one another  Sam isnt really downplaying or being competitive and him and CZ are just joking  You saw CZ congratulate him on the Miami Heat stadium stuff and Sam did it back Did you settle the transaction  You have to settle each transaction  look in the bottom left hand corner on Raydium Hello internet friend  I have a sollet wallet  I sold SOL on limit order for USDC on Raydium  I didn t add the USDC token beforehand  The USDC disappeared  I can t see where my USDC went to  The transaction on the explorer seems very complicated  I ve tried adding a few addresses but I don t where it s gone   Any advice would be really helpful Cardano is one of the proyects  top5  with more developers and development activity https   amp reddit com r cardano comments mwyz5x cardano_again_is_the_top_1_in_development Maybe cardano is slower releasing things because they are doing something different or better than the rest I own both and I think both projects have their chance to be relevant in the future You can use FTX  Send your usdc to FTX via SPL  withdraw it via ERC20 Yes Don t you get screwed on fees when you go through Metamask to make the conversion   Is there no other way to convert Yes  must be that  Thanks Transactions per second I believe What s TPS I m 2mm coins deep just in the last 3 weeks     I agree on the symbol but it makes sense with their MetalX wrapped coins  But I agree Ripple is Microsoft Phone OS at this point If we wanted to host the entirety of the internet internet of things  cars etc on the blockchain we would need much more than 100k tps Ahhh definitely missed that  damn they should have chosen a different symbol than XPR lol ProtonChain  XPR  not Ripple  XRP It is the team behind Metal and Linx  Very cool Defi Pipeline and banking roadmap  Very early on company but they are trying to solve some very real world issues that true blockchain tech can solve  I invest in  network  coins   ETH  EOS  SOL  XPR are my primary holdings right now Haha legit That s a good point  I think its always wise to pick a big up and comer for things in the same project space Thanks dude gt  If you like SOL check out XPR ProtonChainNah  thanks but no thanks    Sold all my XRP into BNB a while ago  figured if i was gonna own one centralized shitcoin it might as well be the one with real functionality since it was copy forked off Ethereum   XRP has got nothing going for it in my view other than a potential victory over the SEC case  then what  Banks will use it   Been saying that for over 5 years and zero tangible evidence has been presented  XLM stands a better chance than XRP even Just buy it will end up moving up above Cardano in my opinion RAY and OXY The main difference is and this is a big one Solana has fully working product with stuff been built on it Cardano has been a work in progress since 2017  they been doing alot of talking and not alot of walking Cardano got nothing on Solana Sorry  but that doesn t sound right to me  I mean yes their solution is many times faster and cheaper but that doesn t explain where the transactions are coming from  If that were the case there should be an incredibly huge backlog of eth transactions just waiting to go thru I read that the vast majority of Solana s  transactions  are due to the validation model which generates many of them for each real transaction Sollet io  create a wallet  and then under whichever coin you have  usdt  usdc  eth  hit receive and it ll let you connect your metamask If you like SOL check out XPR ProtonChain If SOL hits  1k I m retiring to travel the world If you have FTX  you hold UDSC in a  basket of stablecoins  so you can deposit USDC on ERC 20  USDC on SPL  TUSD and they all will be in a shared balance  and then similarly once you deposit any of those stablecoins  you can withdraw the same balance on any protocol Hey mate  Serum should have moat if not all on their DEX as for wallets Exodus atomic or a ledger trezor should be able to hold just about all as well  If not  there are some wallets in the Solana ecosystem  maybe check them out as well smaller block sizes   higher throughput capabilities  tps  Solana block time  400msSolana tps  50kEthereum block time  5 minutesEthereum tps  15If the dapps running on ethereum were capable of this speed  ethereum would have completely literally trillions of transactions to date If you have access to ftx I believe you can swap from erc 20 to spl for free  I m not allowed to use ftx   I recommend the ftx route Thanks for your response  Is it a similar process through FTX or am I able to send through them without converting through MetaMask There is Erc 20 Usdc and SPL Usdc  Coinbase supports Erc 20 USDC  You can convert it to SPL via Metamask and sollet  Keep in mind that will incur eth gas fees to do the swap and solana gas fees to create a USDC wallet if you haven t already done so Welcome to SOL family  I join this about month ago and man this subreddit is one of the best out there  Friendly and helpful people  And also SOL ecosystem is so good  After I have used uniswap 3x im done with the gas fees What solana is not opensource Anyone interested to build on Solana  sunnybeach io and sunnyfarm io listed for sale Gotcha makes sense I probably will  I ll be honest i m pretty new to all this and Binance makes it very easy to less knowledgeable people to do things such as Staking and providing Liquidity I do want to eventually support more decentralised platforms though but thought i d play around on Binance before trying anything else Solana dosnt need layer 2 it allready blows every other blockchain out of the water technically  The markets have been trying to find that Etheruem killer i believe Solana is it oh god I hate rocketships  Are the WSB apes coming Anyone interested to build on Solana  sunnybeach io and sunnyfarm io listed for sale Use the  Add Token  button on Sollet to enable Raydium onto your wallet  will cost a very small amount of SOL   then you should be able to swap into RAY with no issues Also helps to use Sollet wallet instead of trying to connect your ledger wallet  I had issues with using my ledger with SolFlare and had to transfer all my SOL into Sollet for it to work Right now we have one part staked  one part non staked  Would you suggest to stake all of it or keep it like this Thanks for stating it so clearly Anyone interested to build on Solana  sunnybeach io and sunnyfarm io listed for sale Awesome reply I first spotted Solana at like  10  and my dumbass didn t buy it  I secured myself a nice bag around the  30 range though  I m gonna hold long term now Let s be real  there is sooo much shit out there right now Look at all the meme coins and friends with multi billion dollar market caps  I mean   really To me this project here is an exceptionally brisk refresher from all the shilly shit I think they are just incredibly bad at marketing so far  so I am helping out  oh hi  but from what I can tell the project looks remarkably profound and high potential   ‍ ️ From the Solana developer website  Never deal with sharding or layer 2Solana ensures composability between ecosystem projects by maintaining a single global state as the network scales   https   solana com developers  https   solana com developers how do you connect metmask to serum Don t buy on hype  In the case of utility blockchains like this  just go through the list of what s out there and do your research on their claims of what they re offering  Then the opposite by looking for criticisms on the projects  Look at interviews with founders with real interviewers who are respected in decen and not just pump hype beasts  Pay attention to how the interviews go  are the founder skirting hard questions  Also consider  is the problem that is to be solved by the chain or protocol in question really a problem  That is to say  does it need to be decentralized  If so  why Checked your address in Solana Explorer  amp  it shows it already has received an SPL token  KIN  21 days ago  so yeah i suppose it s a Solana Address   Noob Tips    Always try some fraction of SOL  0 002 SOL for example  to check i it s working properly  if YES  then go ahead  amp  send the rest  Make sure to leave some Sol in your Trustwallet for Gas Fees  0 01 SOL is more than enough Saw a recent article mentioning Solana in the same sentence as  Bitcoin  Litecoin and Eth   that s a sign Unfortunately I am not a financial advisor or equipped to say anything about those coins  I would have to dive into the companies behind them  who is backing them financially and what theyre bringing to the market in yerms of tech Its sounds blunt but DYOR is the best answer here  I also tell you that because your financial situation could be totally different from mine  For all I know you could be a millionaire or someone who handles his money very tightly The thing I m most excited about with Solana is its seeming single minded focus on Defi  They could definitely carve out a decent market share and if their tech lives up to the hype it seems the technology most purpose built for decentralized finance Do you know the requirements to invest there I was pretty early because I saw KIN was moving to it  but got fudded out of my position  Someone was going around talking about all the coins being unlocked last December and that it would crush the price  Was like only 10m coins at the time and I agreed and sold to buy in at a lower price which never came  My 3k would be worth 250k now lol It s a team of engineers  which is actually one of the reason I love it  they actually get shit done  so it shouldn t surprise us that the marketing and UX in some cases is lacking  That said  it s still relatively new and is getting better every day on both fronts  Give it time Use ftx us to buy solana  you can use my referral link to get 5  off trading fees https   ftx us  a 2991413   Send your SOL to a solana wallet  I use sollet  and then just go to raydium io  connect your wallet and make your swap  Remember to leave like  1 SOL in your wallet  since all transactions cost SOL  only like  0001  so it s very cheap   You can stake your RAY directly on RAY if you d like to build your stack  that s what I m doing 100 percent agree   love seeing the continued momentum here Sir  how is this substantial That one too  but if Sushi got listed on Coinbase it s only a matter of time before they add Solana  Awareness is the real bottleneck here though  in my humble opinion The survivorship bias is sooo strong in crypto subreddits  Everyone daydreaming about  if they only invested perfectly before ______ asset went 100x Thanks   You ve been helpful I m still under the belief that all the prices we re seeing now are  early  so I wouldn t worry Many people find it difficult to buy  maybe should make it more accessable Nice  in early but not that early And the SOL price is going parabolic Tbh I can t speak to the Serum order book side of things  I know it s a separate thing from liquidity pool swaps which use an AMM  automated market maker  but I don t really understand how it works Thank for your reply   Yes  I m using Raydium   I understand most aspects   I m just trying to fill in the blanks   I guess the swap feature is kind of like an exchange then   An exchange that uses a pool instead of an order book   Liquidity providers in the pool provide that liquidity and they are rewarded accordingly     I take it the Serum Dex is completely separate and draws its liquidity from the order book then Thanks Kyle Samani  one of the founders  was around last bull run  I remember he was shilling Factom at  50   now it is  2 5 and 750th place down coinmarketcap  Just remember these guys invest in a lot of things hoping for 1 to be a real moon shot  Not every call they make is going to pan out check out LUKSO  LYXe  soon to be  LYX  https   lukso network about The founder created the standards for erc 20 tokens  He s now creating the standards for the future NFT space Isn t the peak tested 65k TPS It s still heavily undervalued imo  I ve been buying since the bottom and ain t stopping anytime soon I personally think this project is insanely undervalued  There s evidently institutional interest but zero consumer hype like other top 15 s  I started buying at  1 30 and have been buying all the way up   don t plan on stopping anytime soon If you opted to buy solana over enj  there s your first congratulations job well done  Secondly  I think there s no right time to buy  Today is your best time to buy if you believe in the project  from then on Dollar cost average  buy the dips Read and do your research  this coin was bound to be big if you compare it to other coins I bought a lot more SOL today too  I was thinking the same thing  I just think it s like anything  you could of always been earlier but looking at this  I believe it still has huge potential  I m not an expert but I m confident in it  We ll see Or you could invest  1 million into their fund I brought at  25 and wondered if that was too high to buy     worked out alright so far  Fingers crossed for you but I have faith it ll go higher  I ll buy more end of week Saw it going up  but can t understand the relation with Solana  what s the point  Thanks People like you and me provide the liquidity  The incentive is that they earn fees on every transaction I ve just bought 50 Sol  I know I m not in early but I still believe it has potential and you guys seem very confident  I m starting to wonder if this is a mistake still  Would be great to hear everyone s 1 year predictions to stop me thinking about it as I know a lot of you will be less Biased since you likely got in a lot earlier What I have to do  Just subscribe the newsletter to have the info or something else Solana is closed source  while the rest of the projects are open source and anyone can work with them Where is Elrond How is it possible that they have processed 15x the amount of eth  Doesn t make any sense at all  unless to transfer  1 they tranfer  0 01 100 times All answers here thus far are good  I will just add that this has already happened to a large degree and I don t foresee any large increase in stake amount coming any time soon In the mid 150 s epochs two months ago  APY was in the 13    15  range because there was so much unstaked SOL  so rewards were being distributed to far fewer stake accounts  meaning more per stake account   Then some large chunks of stake were brought online and everyone s APY started to decline as a result   It actually hit as low as about 8 25  a few epochs ago   But it s now risen to about 8 75  due to tuning that the solana devs have done to the network to make it more efficient   There is still more tuning on the way so APY is likely to rise a little bit more in the next few weeks Yeah  if we suddenly need L2 solutions on SOL  the whole ecosystem would be susL2 is needed for ETH in order that ETH can be decentralized This publicity is good forsure and legit the reason I bought 1k today The supply is inflated 8  a year  and that amount is decreased by 15  each year  until the total inflation rate reaches 1 5   in which it will remain stable  The more people that stake  the more of the inflation being split up  so yes you get proportionally less  However  the more people that stake  decreases the amount of supply out on exchanges and creates buying pressure  which causes the price to increase  It s a really well designed system Hi I am trying to send some solana to my trust wallet but I m not sure if this is the right address B5NvzAXdsHkPEQUn7pW6SEM22DrZ11x9UCj9R4WqzPqo for solana    It says coin on the top left corner isn t suppose to say SPL instead of coin gt I m starting to wonder if this is a mistake stillThat s just called being human  Hold that shit and you ll be fine friend At the very least  just make sure you re staking your Solana so you keep earning I once had a bag  bought 2usd  then it became 20  and sold a chuck  Now I live with regret  Will buy back if the darn thing ever dips

up and bought on FTX US today Don t underestimate first mover advantage Better technology does not automatically replace it s predecessors Look at BTC  Superseded a long time ago  yet it s still king  Solana will not replace ETH anytime soon hello  i can t answer  3 but as for  1  i ve done it successfully  only issue is that you can t access their dex without a sollet wallet  so i can t see my order book  but yes  ledger   solflare works fast and fine with raydium your landlord is a cuck Can someone shill me on Solana and how much better it is than competitors EOS peaked in the 2017 cycle  I wouldn t even consider it  I just got into SOL a few days ago  Already seems so much better So is it decentralized I mean I would say you do you  man  We are all in crypto for different reasons  And I guess that s you need to decide on an investment strategy before coming exiting  For example  some people just want to have a  get rich quick  type of investment  and that s fine  So if Doge was a means to make some quick cash and exit then maybe just run with that at least you re on top and had a bit of fun For me  I legitimately think crypto is the future  I have seen a new internet coming forth from technologies like Solana creating the foundation for it and I can possibly see something like Bitcoin becoming the new currency   although call me crazy that one I m a little more sceptical on  For me I m not a finance guy  I work in software  so blockchain technology really gets me excited and I can genuinely see why we need it So my point is  fuck what your work mates think  fuck what your friends and family think  If the crypto interest you  keep digging  find what you love about a project and if you see there s a need for it and why you think it s the best   and invest I love the sun   Praise Sol No dice  Thanks for the suggestions though Kinda late to the party but I managed to secure SOL at  40 and I am ready for another moon Actually I did some research  I first heard about it on some finance podcast  It was an interview with the founder  I liked the way he talked and I could tell he really knew what he was talking about  I m also an engineer   Anyway  after that I did some reading about project and decided that it all sounded very promising  Then as i had missed the ico I had to sit and wait for it to be listed which happened a few months later  I bought in a couple of days after it launched on Binance do it and update us in the future please  lt 3 Well  its interesting because you can use Solana or any other crypto that supports smart contracts i did it  i m 100  sol right now  if it went down i ll go down with it  if we moon then i ll win big high risk  high reward  fuck diversification  YOLO This has nothing to do with Solana I bought at  4   6   23  and  40  People aren t seeing the big picture Yeah  I m so damn busy though  But I really wanna learn  There must be tons of interesting projects out there  and probably very few developers with experience This is amazing There is already another shitcoin called SDOGE  The owner created his discord account a couple of days or so and they listed on serum market where users will have to add the market ID  I m so concerned for anyone that buys  They ll just take your money  The website looks like it was put together in 1 minute  Please be very careful and don t put your money into any project until you can confirm it s legit by looking at their website  social media and any information you can find to confirm it s legit otherwise you ll be giving money to scammers  Just be safe I m talking about the whole Dot ecosystem  not only the token  which is mostly there for the governance   https   coinmarketcap com alexandria article a deep dive into polkadot That is the way   lol My Landlord will have to Hodl on because the rent is all in Haha you know I actually had a feeling it was that  but it sounded that bad I didn t want to say the wrong amount by accident  Either way Solana dwarfs it  but man that s slow haha Go for it  Surely worth trying it out to see if you like it  There s plenty of people making the switch from other fields into crypto Yep  wormhole I think you are mistaken  it should be opposite  Dot is Layer 1 and Sol is layer 0 Hello  we are SwapSwop io  a cryptocurrency exchange platform  We love crypto and we like to do things our own way and communicate with crypto enthusiasts  Exchange SOL with us  and if something is not clear  ask us anything in the comments  we and ready to help  BTW where do you exchange your crypto assets and why PS  it looks like this post is not spam or anything similar by community guidelines  Mods  please let us know if something is wrong It s a very underrated plan  Takes minimal amounts of time and should reduce stress compared to people who are going to bed every night invested in coins that could be flatlined when they wake up gt I did undelegate  SOL for 4 days but didn t see  withdraw  on solflare com   Before that I used to see  withdraw  button and tried to withdraw during the cool down period but can t   I understand that    gt    gt Where is the  Withdraw  button    gt    gt Any advice  please    gt    gt Thanks Thanks Ok but  what if a validator RPC node broadcasts my Tx and then the Leader  which was referred to as Generator in the whitepaper  produces a block w o my Tx  Is that block valid  Will it get rejected not voted on by validators  Because if I understood it correctly it s only the leader that proposes new blocks  am I right Wrt the RPC nodes situation  I think that s actually a problem as well  but I m confident that the SOL team will solve it Thank you for your answer Depends how much I have what I m doing with it  I have like 10 wallets haha  main thing is don t keep it all in one place Airdrop What a great comment  thanks I read the Elrond white paper   I m not sure I understand your enthusiasm   I didn t see anything unique about their sharding proposal except that they describe complex on chain methods for the shards to be dynamically restructured to try to improve their efficiency   There is nothing in the whitepaper that would give confidence to me that this will actually make sharding any more effective   Furthermore  it was easy to identify some flaws with some of their proposals that lead me to believe that there could easily be deeper flaws elsewhere since they missed some obvious ones   For example  including a randomness function in the blocks  where each block proposer determines the randomness seed for that block by signing the previous seed   The problem here is that the proposer of the block gets to decide not to emit a block because it doesn t like the outcome of transactions that include that randomness and wants to wait for a better outcome in a different block   For example  if the randomness is used to choose winners of a game  or to generate a unique NFT  then block proposers have incentive to skip transactions that don t have favorable results  for them    for example if they re also playing the game  and hope that later they can get the transaction into a different block that has better random outcome for them That s the most obvious flaw I saw   The rest of it was all just a lot of ideas that I don t think necessarily are better than any other ideas for how to do sharding  which is a fundamentally flawed concept to begin with But I d be interested in knowing what you think is so good about Elrond because I must have missed something Provide liquidity for SRM BUSD in pancak and farm the hell out of it  lol I m not sure if you have any understanding of electronics But the better term for scaling IMO would be  parallel vs series   Solana increases the speed of transactions processed in series Elrond for example has slower block times of 6 seconds  However  they scale their network by processing transactions in parallel via mainnet sharding TLDR Solana scales to process transactions faster Other networks scale by processing more transactions at the same time There is  Step Finance  https   step finance  in Solana so far  The front page of Solana  https   stepfinance medium com the first step 30fa9b740218  https   stepfinance medium com the first step 30fa9b740218 The projects you listed use layer 2 sharding solutions  Solana scales it s mainnet  Mainnet scaling is far superior This is why the only sharded blockchain I m invested in is Elrond  They found a way to implement sharding right on their mainnet for horizontal scaling Elrond and Solana are my top 2 projects  as I see  web3 0 and Defi as the biggest gainer for crypto over the next 10 years Need more nerd power Make sense  thanks a lot Check with SolFlare support in their Telegram Group   https   t me SolFlare _Wallet  https   t me SolFlare_Wallet for sure thanks guys just ordered a ledger if you are trying to convert  34  you will have more than enough  Solana fees are 0 000005 SOL per transaction Not yours keys  not yours coins in stocks it isn t manipulation imosol had good news against macro market Sure I ll yolo some I m also staking in exodus  I find it very easy to do  I know that to unstake  my fund

6BsxGhyWjwNitWSFYpfoQnF2qeavSzRbP8PADbzKXnkLJust logged on here  Sent on enough to get you started  Its still quite tricky to get the right tokens into the wallet  I know you are US  but if you have access to a VPN the guy up top was right  crypt to crypto on Binance is ok to use  I just signed up and sent them tethers for sol in the end  Different if your in NY  hide your location anecdotal at best  3 out of a million dropouts dont make a good statistic Is there anything Serum does that Raydium doesn t do Hardware always Honestly couldn t say  but if i was to take a stab at it      just the brightness and fade of the colours used     eek Looking at the tech behind it  the companies backing it up and the way their coin is build up   yes I really think so   but then again   Im def not an expert and as we say in The Netherlands  The whish is father to the tought I m new and want to know more  Any particular place to start This show is mostly clickbait and shilling sponsored coins and not actually giving advice  Note  Not financial advice    It s the same old story  They have already filled their bags ages ago now just use the viewers to pump the price while they dump the coins  Numerous times already have they  promised  to do something on stream and then just skipped it altogether Yeah  gonna do a  1 million live trade on stream  Put a 10k order in and cancel it when the exchange no longer is on the screen   You gonna have Joe Biden on your stream  Yeah sure you did  And the next thing you are gonna say about this is that  it was just a joke  the stream is for entertainment purposes only  You would be an idiot to believe anything we say  And yeah  I agree on the believing part Was this recorded Oh yes definitely a scam  I certainly did not put anything into this  was just hoping for the free airdrop and then they vanished  Thanks Does anyone know what this means Isn t SRM available on binance Hope you got that long position in Serum is probs the biggest now  but I think RAY has a huge opportunity  Check OXY as well Looking for a team is all Honestly I have a massive concept I m trying to launch that I hope could be a real pull for the average person to download and a free mobile app and get launched into crypto without even realizing it After tried the Plutus  I observed that the Cardano s software quality is so so   Compared with other open source project  its version control and documentation are not up to standard I kind of understand that why they got so many major delays I look forward to it But surely there has to be a more productive way to get into Solana than this   There must be  or else we are lost 5000 people received the cope airdrop  no dump happened Sounds like a scam  hope you didnt put in any money in it  Airdrops   free giveaways are just sound too good to be true  i pass every single time and maybe i missing out but at least my funds are safe and slowly growing Thanks  Yeah after Binance it was refreshing to get actual support  They fixed the bug that made balances display as 0 while unstaking  and thankfully Solana s unstaking period is only 4 days so I got to see my balance back pretty quickly I ll be making another post in a few weeks to show you the progress being just watch the moon ride from the sidelines SAMO literally launched yesterday and you expect it to be on coingecko Even rope took weeks Compelled to try and explain cause your version sucks balls Lets say you have a  node  e g  a computer on a network  Ten transactions are submitted to that network and need to be confirmed and validated ASAP Horizontal scaling would mean you add more nodes to do the work  So if you have ten nodes you could confirm all ten transactions concurrently   horizontally Vertical scaling means you increase the capacity of a single node  So if you had one node  it would have to confirm all the transactions consecutively  but you an make it faster by increase it s CPU and IO capacity  To get a little nerdier   It s naive to think of things as horizontal vs vertical scaling  They have tradeoffs  Vertical scaling means one thing knows more about what s going on  Horizontal means a bunch of things have to coordinate with each other wtf is going on as they do individual work  So while some things get faster others get slower and visa versa This is all the same computer science that makes up most of the modern web  How tweets get interpolated into a twitter follower streams  transactions on block chains get confirmed across nodes  I dunno  how your computer probably has scaled horizontally to have multiple CPU cores to make it so you can scroll Reddit while you watch Netflix without affecting each other In the case of Solana  After reading the  white paper  https   www competitivecyclist com shimano spd cleat sets shi0341 s a   It is my understanding when people add commentary about the vertical vs horizontal scaling they re referring to the  Proof of History generator   This is providing order to the transactions so their is less work for validators to confirm blocks  So one single node does some extra work so a bunch of other nodes can do less  At least that s my understanding of it So this node could be a  bottleneck   That said  it seems like it s a really fucking wide bottleneck  So we re probably fine I searched and found solstarter app and just participated in the cardstarter app IDO so I got super excited and got scammed for 3500 dollars   my fault I didn t do more reasearch before I jumped in layer 2 doesnt require sharding  ZK rollups would allow more throughput but are complicated https   discord gg rpeQgyCyThat s a link to their discord maybe you can go in and see for yourself if it s a  shitcoin    it s a community project and I used the term meme coin because it has no specific use case atm but it s not a bad investment  don t discourage people if you haven t made proper research about something For many this may force users not familiar with Solana to make a sollet and actually try out Raydium or something  It could make for a good introduction to the low transaction fees and near instant finality I agree  I m seeing a lot of maximalists here  everywhere  but the truth is that there is a tool for every job  I think having a tool to move across chains will be pretty cool Lmao that s really funny  just can t pick the shitcoins  I haven t even bought doge but maybe lol I rather stick to principle fundamentals and investing in coins that will grow defi like Sol It means  have fun staying poor You guys know who he is no  He s a validator so he s supporting this coin you could say   It s a valid question  Just remember that the majority of cryptocurrency traders are in for the upside and don t care about the planet whatsoever  Solana is a good tech  so you could say this meme coin is better than worse tech meme coins Banned means what exactly in this context Vertical scaling is actually scaling   You are making the first class  network wide consensus transactions faster Horizontal scaling is mostly a shell game   You claim that you are doing many more TPS  but in fact you are doing a limited form of transaction that does not have network wide consensus   That limited form of transaction brings tons of problems with it that are just as hard to solve   And thus the projects  scaling  this way continue to be vaporware   See Polkadot  Eth2  Cardano  etc etc The last statement is legit  That s what my plan is Which is impossible to change  so yeah More hardware and even that drops in pricing every two years  Sharding sucks and is not the solution  You just end up losing security with it along with it being censor resistant More marketing  Bro it s growing organically and Sam Bankman is behind it and funding it  What marketing could it really need  It has just started liftoff and is in the top 15 now I am not sure but I think the difference is Cardano will be more secure but slower and less versatile so good for applications where you won t tolerate any failures  like government stuff etc      Solana will be great for things that need to run really fast and can tolerate extremely exceptionally rare failure  Both have their purpose is staking on exodus alright With FTX you don t need to worry about which version of usdc you have  it sends the correct version based on the wallet address it s going to  From ftx you can send usdc straight to sollet without having to worry about converting You can stake as little as you want  And txn fees are negligible How many SOL do you need to be able to stake Not buying anything else for now  Maybe xlm or avalanche if they manage to deliver on their promises I value sol at 100x from here  Simple valuation method is sol txn fees are 1 millionth of eth  The tokens are effectively pricing cost of txns  If sol ecosystem continues to grow and they are able to deliver on evm compatibility  cost of doing txn on sol will reach some sensible parity with eth  End state if eth manages to make txn fees 1 10th and sol txn increase 100x we still have a significant gap  No reason why sol won t do 100x from here   except if the founders have gotten ahead of themselves in making promises they cant deliver  like cardano Absolutely not  Have fun staying poor Why is he banned  It s a valid opinion  Instead of banning shouldn t have good discussion and differing perspectives Give us the whole error message or screenshot that so we can help you You can always go to their Discord Or Telegram for more info about this matter

as simple as this   if it has no team or shadow team   just consider that a scam    We re going to see lots of fake   scams like this using the Solana blockchain  so we count on the high quality IQ of the Solana community  no tot fall into such scams thank you for this post  stay safe   amp  Take care yourself Your questions about PoH are answered here https   www reddit com r solana comments mvj9o4 leader_blocks gvcviyw The term is  validators   not  generators    The incentive for validators is that every vote they cast that is on a block earns rewards if that block ends up in the block chain   Since every validator assumes that only valid blocks with valid transactions will gather enough votes to end up on the blockchain  validators only vote for blocks with valid transactions   Therefore once a block has the requisite number of votes  it is permanently in the blockchain and all votes that were on it end up paying vote rewards to the validator s vote account  of which the non commission share  most of it  goes to stakers  and the validator s commission part stays with the validator Validators are not allowed to vote on more than one fork at once   After a validator has voted on a block  it is only allowed to vote on blocks chained off of that fork for a period of time   If the validator realizes that it voted on a now dead block  it must wait a period of time before resuming voting on the fork that  won  In this way  validators have incentive to  only  vote on valid forks and to stick with their choice   This drives consensus Validators are supposed to be  slashed   punished by forfeiture of earnings and possibly stake  if they violate the voting rules and vote on more than one fork at once   But slashing is not implemented yet   Thus far that voting rule has been enforced by the  honor system  End users typically communicate with an  RPC node  that accepts their requests to add transactions to the network   The  RPC node  is itself a validator that then broadcasts the transaction and gets it on the network   Any validator can run as an RPC node and answer such requests  but only a small fraction of validators actually run RPC nodes   At the moment almost everyone is going through Solana s officially maintained RPC nodes   But it doesn t have to be that way   Anyone could run their own RPC node and directly engage with the network  but this is bandwidth intensive gt  Scaling vertically always finds a limit Can you elaborate the difference of vertical horizontal scaling Solana traded on Coinbase Are you able to buy HOLY as a US citizen Banned Ahaha yeah  that s how I trade shitcoins  Get in early  sell half when it does a 2 3x  then let the rest ride I ve been able to significantly increase my Solana position  and I ve only missed the big dump one time so far Don t you people have better things to do than trade useless shitcoins back and forth to each other   Tell me how anything you are doing adds any value to the planet whatsoever Did you even watch  He was focused on the long term gains   Not sure how his decision to invest 1 million dollars of his own money for a long term hold is somehow scamming you I meant SAMO coin lol Scammer  SOL has dipped 4  since this was streamed  SOL is great and great long term   but this dude s advice is sketch The marketcap is only 12 Billion  I see no reason why we can t 4x from here Sol is on coingecko Im not smart enought to understand this article  but i know that big amount of transactions per second is nothing new in crypto space  Being faster than outdates bitcoin isnt really much to be proud of I m afraid there isn t much I can do  These issues are a bit difficult to solve for others due to their nature Why can t I find this coin on any legit websites that list coins like coingecko lol I can only find it on dex s  I want to find the graph as well This is the way with crypto it seems  The whole market is bullish and we are still far away from overall adoption even with mainstream adopting Bitcoin Hello  I bought in today at 45 dollars  I m thinking this could and will go much higher I have  35758 SOL and I am trying to convert  34 of it   How much do I need to leave for fees Will have to leave some sol to pay for transaction costs  Both for the swap and to send the SPL USDC elsewhere  Similar to how ethereum is used to pay for erc 20 token fees Listed on OpenSerum  https   openserum ch dex   market FR3SPJmgfRSKKQ2ysUZBu7vJLpzTixXnjzb84bY3Diifa promising DEX followed by SBF  Solana and Anatoly on twitter Airdrops are only 8  of the

s it  Free  kind of  is always better SOL actually wants ETH to survive and it will  For all we know they may work together as it s been hinted around  There s enough developers and developments for both layers and other layers as well When I learned that they created Proof of History  I pulled the trigger and never looked back Considering trying my hand at Solana development I m currently a full stack web dev  and have never worked with blockchain before Excellent I don t think you understand the technology involved in Dot  The most important difference is that it is layer0 while Sol is layer1  you could build Solana in the Dot ecosystem The main idea behind the Dot ecosystem is the parachain  It allow trust free interchain transactability between different ecosystem blockchains apps via XCMP  Mean you can connect different blockchain to the Dot ecosystem with bridges Just like Eth has Solidity  Dot has his own framework to create layer1 blockchain  Substrate  On top of that  Dot already has much more application built on it  but many of them are waiting the release of the parachain to be public  https   electric capital github io  p  ecosystem polkadotDot is really another beast https   twitter com JetProtocol status 1386689939744694273  https   twitter com JetProtocol status 1386689939744694273 Twitter announcement above  Another exciting project to keep an eye out for on Solana How diversified you should be in your crypto portfolio depends  Do you have all your savings in this  If you only have  say  25   in crypto and 75   in a worldwide index fund in the stock market you can make an argument for caring a lot less about diversification When it comes to drawbacks for Solana the main thing is to gain developers and users  Ethereum has a big headstart in this area  I believe in a future where both Ethereum and Solana will thrive because the usecases for these blockchains are abundant that it will not be desired to have all activity connected to one base layer  But it s not like there s no other competitors either  you have Polkadot and Cosmos for instance or even things like Avalanche and Cardano I believe in Solana a ton  but there s for sure reasons to still stay diversified  Personally I like an allocation between BTC  ETH and SOL because they re the layer 1 s I like the most  Then I will further invest in projects that build on these chains  like Sushiswap on Ethereum and Serum on Solana for instance I would of pulled out of EOS a longggg time ago  Just saying Grateful KIN decided to migrate to solana which brought to my attention and allowed to me to get in early  Around  18 share DCA  Hodling for the long term as I am in love with this project Well I ve already started seeing Fake Solana Telegram groups promoting x3 return on any coins you send  allegedly because the ecosystem is growing   Or there was a post here regarding some  SAMO shitcoin comparing it to doge The tech is different  Solana can handle more tps  The validation process is also very different  SOL use  proof of history when Litecoin  if I m correct  use a proff of work  they have a different impact on performances and sustainability  which allow Solana more scalability  And the Solana ecosystem is actually exploding Solana should have a higher market cap than DOT and ADA  right now  The solution technology is better  the project is more advanced in it s roadmap and already have many usage   ETH has much more usage and reputation but their tech is subpar  SOL is definitely very cheap with a market cap of 12 B  I hope people realise it before it s too late to get in hahaha Damn bro what made you buy at the time gt Since then  no security issues and the price has held despite the huge dump of coins from January  https   github com

first so you don t loose your assets Chainlink will be one of the oracle providers for Solana  and currently  that is in development  not operating   Here is the project   https   solana com ecosystem chainlink  https   solana com ecosystem chainlink Don t know all the technical terms for it but the difference for me is leadership  Solana has full backing of FTX and is going to do what Binance  CZ  did with BNB   but better As far as I understood    Solana s theoretical limit is around     700k tps    based on currently available consumer available hardware     Why is then limited to 50k tps    For 700k tps Hardwear   bandwidth requirements would be too heavy for validators  effects on profitability number of coin that validator would need to stake to be profitable  which as a consequence would have reduced decentralization decreased number of validators   Also  in addition  I believe there is a lot of optimization needed to be done to achieve this kind of throughput Yes  Solana is designed to scale with Moores law  This means we can expect TPS to essentially double every 2 years    I believe that at the moment  this is the fastest Layer 1 blockchain that s currently active  The only other project I see scaling at a similar level is Elrond I don t count ADA in this category  because their solution is layer 2 scaling  Elrond and Solana rapidly scale their layer 1 blockchains Invest only money you are willing to lose gt Really low transactions fees  super fast and scalability no hate but how is that any different between using litecoin  lightning netowrk and shit no offense but whats the point of investing 65   imo its not worth the time to research if you only gonna invest that Is there someway for it to scale beyond 55k transactions a second That s a good question   Considering Ray is built on top I d say that the short answer is no   Unless Serum develops a product that Raydium doesn t implement  entirely possible  although maybe not common    then yes That being said  each layer you stack on top of each other always compounds the risk for issues and bugs   A layer 1 will always be more stable than a layer 10     So there is a benefit to removing unnecessary layers to a transaction you have need u just made ppl lose a x5 I m doing DCA  We don t have even decent wallet yet publicly available  Very early Thank you https   coinmarketcap com currencies solana markets  https   coinmarketcap com currencies solana markets I ve been correct only once Any exchange you can recommend that allow transferring Solana You need to add RAY token address in your wallet  this will cost you   0 002 SOL i  n addition to the standard transfer fee Well let me know about your next 50x idea You may try any exchange that have sol on it  Send some SOL to your Atmoic Wallet SOL Address Ha  I told everyone I knew  The only person who listened turned 1000usd into around 50k Also  it actually has a main net with smart contracts and developers  In these times where vapor projects go up to tens of billions  it kinda feels like a milestone Solana already has a two way bridge with Eth  Which is currently being used to port over Eth Dapps and tokens   As far as layer 2  Solana is designed not to need layer 2 solutions which is why this project is so elegant  If Solana scales globally they may want to implement something like this  I don t see why it is necessary  but I also don t see why they couldn t do this if they wanted Damn I wish you had told me  I m only in at  35 Where can I send solana from  That s where I m stuck I got in at around 0 5usd  No plans to sell any time soon can you name names  or is the chaos not that imminent You simply click     UnStake Ray      even without hitting the     Harvest     Button you ll still get what you earned from Staking in your Sollet Wallet or whatever wallet you re linking it to Raydium You need some SOL in your atomic Wallet o be used as Gas Fee so the transaction can b sent Let s say you add like 0 005 SOL to your Atomic Wallet  amp  try to sen that transaction again Thanks for the response  Don t use whatsapp anymore but thank you for the consideration Lol Yea they are very different

problem Barely anything  7  for crypto is just another day at the office Waiting for a bigger one to get in You re only going to get one answer on this sub  Maybe try  r cryptocurrency or some other one that s more neutral Let s go so messed up Its giving you a window to buy it low  Throw your rent in it Thanks  Just submitted a tech support message It s there a minus button Yes https   discord gg rpeQgyCyThis is the discord link for samoyed Most of em happen on Discord just gotta keep your eyes peeled  we have a whatsapp groupchat dedicated to finding them too  lemme know if you re interested That s just the interest you earned though right  How could I get everything off Normally parabolic tokens move against the market When your are in staking page there is a button to unstake its named  harvest   you have to click on the cross on the right to make it appear first This is on Binance if it matters  If anyone has alternative places to buy please let me know as a again I m new to everything crypto and had this recommended to me so thought I d make a start of getting in I agree with what you said and I picked up Solana after some research and becoming aware of its technological advantages over other coins and it s big network of applications but these kind of articles are happy reassurance Because it s the fastest Nobody knows what price would be in one year  Do research  get a true conviction for something  and enjoy the ride  If you have a strong conviction for Solana you are at the right place to share your knowledge  contribute to the ecosystem together with other Solmates     saying that  Solana is and can continue to break the chart gravity Yea  Its fucked  Pure regulatory capture  I remember when the guy did this  moved straight from government to the private sector as an advisor on the law he d just written  Made me understand what we are aiming for Lots of validators will see your transaction if it s broadcast on the network   The next validator may not elect to put it in its proposed block  although that would be unusual  the validator software doesn t treat transactions this way  but who knows someone could run hacked software   but almost certainly the validator after that or the validator after that will   Basically the chances that no validators decide to put it in a block is infinitesimally small The much bigger concern for you would be if your transaction ends up in a dead fork   No harm done  but your transaction will fail and you will have to send it again later   The only real problem here is that it will take longer to complete your transaction since you had to try it twice  being unlucky that your first attempt ended up on a dead fork Transactions have a limited lifespan   when they are proposed  it is for a limited range of slots that are written into the transaction   So you can always know if your transaction completed because if you don t see it by the last slot that it was valid for  then it never made it into the chain for some reason   You just send the transaction again   The chances of this happening once are small  twice are infinitesimal Phantom hands down FTX or Blockfolio Find it Really low transactions fees  super fast and scalability is really high too  in Sam we trust  FTX CEO I use math wallet for that purpose And Exodus to hold and stake reimagined digital wallet for DeFi and NFTs  I don t think Sollet can hold NFTs rn Where is the best exchange to buy SOL What are the top 3 reasons I should get some Solana Currently into projects like VET  ALGO  ETH  LINK  XMR  and to a lesser degree ADA IOTA DOT NANO I keep mine on exodus  I don t have much of it but keep chipping in when i can Solana Transactions are the Quickest  Guy from Qualcomm solved the puzzle Same as here bro  But still cheap for re buy don t worry just focus on toda  Past is past Yeah I broke the number one rule of doing a test run before you send it all across  Rookie mistake  Glad you got yours back though Im not sure there are any  Havnt read much about exodus staking but as long as you can choose who you delegate to  thats all us decentralization buffs care about haha I mean I ve actually minted a few NFTs on various sites to get a feel for gas costs etc and yeah  they re absurd  I genuinely don t understand why ETH is used to widely And from a technical pov BTC is garbage too gt  It will be Ethereum and Solana dot and terra say hello Terra   Anchor protocol  fix rate Defi savings protocol  is in development  and soon it should be launched  super cool I made the same mistake transferring sol from binance to exodus   correct wallet but to the btc address instead of the sol address  Got the confirmation and then nearly had a heart attack when I realized what I d done  Considered it a loss but later discovered that the funds never left binance and were still in my account  Very lucky What is the difference of these 2  thanks What else besides Sol are you buying  I have Cardano so I am surprised to read your comment  but still appreciate your perspective  thanks I ve been wondering this exact thing  I ve only started trading properly for two months but have noticed cryptos that have solid fundamentals trending negative for a few days tend to rocket   20   once they hit the lowest price in a week I think reading news or listening to so called  gurus  should come second  In my opinion  to find the best up and coming projects you need to get off Binance and actually use the technology  By doing this you know what the problems are and then can look for projects that are solving these problems  For example if you used the Eth network you would know that gas prices are outrageous  Knowing this you can find projects such as SOL  BSC or polygon Matic  which are solving the issue Ah me too  went in at 18 cos the speed and transaction capacity seemed great for consumer apps  exited most of it at 36 but it hasnt dipped since and doesnt seem like its about to   Am back in at 40 xD Oh yeah totally  I just made like 5 BNb from shitcoins in the last 2 days and I m going to ladder my way up to Solana  That way at least in my mind I have a better entry price than  45 I ve been in situations like this  If you see a gem like Solana but it s already been on a run  I think the best thing to do is to look a level lower  I e serum or radium   Naturally these will pop next  then you can take the profits and buy the blue chip SOL Just Stop it  Until I can buy some  Deal Are you certain Me too Like any good idea  invention  business  etc   a blockchain needs to do something novel   It needs to solve a problem that isn t being fully addressed  or perhaps is being addressed poorly   I found Solana when I started researching alternatives to Ethereum   Ethereum was novel  because it was the first blockchain to hit it big with smart contracts and it has amassed a tremendous ecosystem However  Ethereum has gotten too big for its britches  and is bursting at the seams   It has become extremely congested and fees have gone through the roof  barring the last few days    Solana solves both the problem of congestion and high fees  with very high throughput and very low fees   It also supports smart contracts  and has a good ecosystem that is rapidly developing   Ethereum s problems became Solana s opportunity Solana is one of many blockchains looking to solve this problem  and a lot of them out there are even powered by Solidity EVM   Solidity is the programming language of Ethereum smart contracts   EVM is the Ethereum Virtual machine  which executes those smart contracts on the blockchain   Binance Smart Chain did quite a brilliant job with this  because they also stood up many clones of DeFi projects on BSC  since it s easy enough to just port the code over to their blockchain Many projects on Ethereum ported themselves over to BSC as well   There are quite a few Uniswap clones on BSC   I think BSC still has potential  because right now they put up a lot of roadblocks for US citizens  as do a lot of crypto projects    If when they open things up to US citizens  making it easy to transfer from  binance us  https   binance us  to a BSC wallet   it will probably grow further   Along with it  a lot of the BSC ecosystem will grow as well  pancakeswap and the like  To find a blockchain to get in early  you need to put it into the context of what differentiates it from the others   There really are few blockchains out there that do anything different than all the others  so this is much easier said than done   The next big thing isn t going to do what Solana is doing or what all those other side chains are doing   The next big thing is going to fix a problem that hasn t been fixed yet  or even a problem that hasn t even been identified yet As others have read  do your own research   Just because I might mention BSC  pancakeswap  Ethereum  don t go out and buy them on my word   I could be one of a million shills out there selling you snake oil   Learn more about them yourself   As you research  you ll learn about other interesting projects  and might find some diamonds in the rough I realize that much of what I say is rather  pie in the sky    You may never find a single blockchain that is totally novel and different from anything else out there   There will no doubt be competitors trying to do solve the same problem   So you ll need to look at all of them when they re in the starting stages  and try to pick out one or a small handful of the ones you think can make it big  you really need to think like a venture capitalist  You also have to look at the other factors like the ecosystem and ecosystem development   The most successful projects out there had great resources for developers early in the project lifecycle  so that by the time they went to mainnet  there were already working Dapps running on the platform Look for ICO listing sites to learn about what sort of new projects are seeking funding   If you re in the USA or another country that ICO s tend to shut out  that s okay   You don t need to get in on the ICO  because chances are it s crap anyway   There will already be competitors further in their journey that are probably doing a better job of addressing the need   But the ICO will lead you to research the competitors and possibly buy them instead Hope that helps a little   Best of luck What s a typical outcome if you stake 300 SOL coins Awesome  Thanks In 5 years you ll be like  I was in under  50   and everybody will hate you I think they posted the 5 winners for memelords only  Those guys will get 3M tokens  Other memers will receive 1M tokens  I don t know how many will be chosen but based on what the admins said in the chats and announcements  there will be many winners so I m still not giving up hope wait there is a solana exchange  how do I  get there Just curious  What about the color scheme intrigued you Don t buy this crap  2000 people got free airdrops  They are just waiting to dump on you no one knows the future  But let s just compare Solana to its biggest competitor Etherium  Let s look at it if we were to make a project on eitherEtherium  Cost a shitload to use  as the price rises this becomes is more of a joke  Some project ETH to hit 10k this year   some transactions would therefore cost  1 000 eachETH off the top of my head runs 3 000 TPS  transactions per second   Visa is 15 000 TPS  for comparison   This means Etherium is already slowSome say Etherium isn t fully decentralised and scalability is in serious question due to the rises in price and slow speeds amp  x200B Solana  Cost peanuts to use  like we re talking cents not dollars for transaction fee sThe fastest blockchain in the world   proven and OVER 50 000 TPS  Not some fake fantasy land where it hopes to reach some blown out crazy numbers that it can t proveSolana doesn t use sharding  I m not sure on the technicals of why it s amazing they don t use it  but people love that it doesn t   for reference ETH 2 0 will use Sharding to reach faster TPS speeds It is TRULY decentralised with over 700 validator nodes and is built for worldwide adoption  amp  x200B Now Etherium hasn t hit worldwide adoption and is struggling with its growth  just imagine if Solana gets just as big    or reaches their goal and becomes the biggest as crypto adoption continues to grow  Buying now at anything under  100 is a bargain This is just my personal view  the above is factual though  although of course tailored to SOL pro s  but at the end of the day  no one knows what will happen I just figured it out  I didn t press settle on SOL  I was pressing only on USDC  I m an idiot  Thank you so much for your help  Can finally buy some COPE Results are already posted  I didnt win I struggle to make money on binance  as I can t find an easy way to see the price open I paid for the coins  to know if a trade will   profit in the first place Otherwise I d be able to buy the dips sell the peaks etc Got any tips It is and always has been really down to two basic principles 1  Store your key seed safely2  Be careful where  any of  your tokens go Found out that Terra have their stablecoins on Solana   Eth so thats why they are in the ecosystem Solana didn t really respond to this recent BTC dip at all  now it s starting to bounce back it might look like SOL is weaker compared to others but compare the growth over the past week As for why it didn t react to BTC like most other altcoins  I would guess the rates for locked staking mean most SOL holders are in for the longterm We might see another hackathon soon She s bounced off the MA  enjoy the ride past 50 all sollet io until phantom goes off beta I sold 127 Solana when it pumped 22  at the beginning of this last hike  Planned on getting back in in a few days  I want to punch myself in the face Where are these airdrops happening  Do I just need to keep solana on my solflare wallet to get some of these drops  Is there a telegram chat I love  sollet io  https   sollet io  wallet  simple and fast Bought at  1 30   10   30 and bought more today I also bought a little SRM to support the ecosystem What kind of scams  Rug pull coins using the solana network Thanks bud I will give this a go Check out  solsaver  https   www solsaver xyz    a tool made for this Use at your own risk of course  Alternatively  you can replicate the steps solsaver automates for you manually   Steps are in the source code Thank you so much  exactly what I want   May I ask  do you know any yield optimizer   for example  in Ethereum there s  yearn finance  https   yearn finance    in Binance there s Autofarm   but haven t found anything in Solana yet I didn t realise that Terra Luna was part of Solana s ecosystem do you know anything about that I don t care for the coin itself but I care about the people who invest in it Hi mostly concern by scams if this coin keeps going up far  I m Dad I m mostly concern by scams if this coin keeps going up far Kind of a nice dip now    seems to do this new all time high thing  then stabilize for a few candles and or dip  then hit new high  I m averaging in buys and loving it   SOLdier here for sure Man I snoozed and bought 10 coins at  6 5 each  waited for the dip to buy more    the dip never came ETH is like   15 TPS  Not 3000 Add ray token address to your wallet first Much appreciated  coingecko doesn t have the trading view integration   Anything like dex vision available https   coinmarketcap com view solana ecosystem Glad you said it  I have a freind that think coins are supposed to keep going up  lol but what about the crazy gains it made already    So thirsty Its not upper circuit everyday  Solana has had a massive rally in a relatively short time  and whenever it will be over there will be a period of consolidation  I have seen this scenario play out a lot with other cryptos  so this is nothing to worry about  Just keep hodling staking and watch your other portfolio rise for a change thank you so much Gregorypeckam  really appreciate it  Don t have access to a VPN right now  but will look into is  Trying to do anything other than very basic stuff in crypto when you are a NY resident is just a nightmare Hardware ledger There s a way to stake SOL if I have them on Binance SOLAna  as above so below lol best answer It doesnt need near term scalability    the network isnt even close to being taxxed and its running the FTX exchange doing massive volume through serum with no hiccups at all Dude sit down in the backseat and enjoy the ride   They are already on it   They done need some scam artist to come in and pump the coin   They are developing real undeniable tech   A slow steady rise is what we want    its gone 2  to 45  in less than a year   Having a scamer come in and pump it to 250 just to have it dump back down is not healthy despite what the crypto worlds embodiment of greed would like   Im sorry you just got in yesteday   Hopefully you can really load your bags after a consolidation in the 30s or 20s Cardano is also just a fork of another coin if I m not mistaken  Kinda says all you need to know Solana has increased in price by  1125  in the last 3 months  A lot of other coins have not  I wouldn t read to much into movement over a couple of days Just by looking at the trend  Solana could just act as the safe heaven against losses the same as gold vs the Dollar  Somebody on the redit group early noted that during last week s sell off   Solana didn t fall with it assuming that large corporations needing capital or just needed to sell off didn t hold any Solana Always hardware  especially if you are going to leave and stake your SOL  not touching for a while Anyone know where you can chart Solana eco system tokens I don t know  you should check out the site and ask their customer support Ideally you find your own way  but a place to start is with obviously smart people who are building cool things like the co founders of Solana  Vitalik from Ethereum and so on  And then you can look at who they follow and interract with to find more useful accounts  There s also many good follows who work at crypto native funds like Paradigm and DeFiance Capital etc
2021-04-28,43.16144021,46.91656515,40.67207182,Star atlas Yeah I don t know where that info is coming from    We do know that sushiswap is planning to cross integrate with raydium Solana utilizes a  leader  consensus model  Essentially consensus is dictated by one leader at a time and the rest of the validators simply replicate the ledger  Being centralized is a subjective term but how  decentralized  is a protocol that is reliant on a single validator at any given time by design  Take down the leader and take down the network  Didn t that recently just happen Also  I don t believe your node information is accurate  pretty sure Stellar and Ripple have over 100 nodes 1000 good 2000 better 10 000 anybody happy One thing i have question about  what is the proof of pancake swap moving to solana Thanks for the source So  it seems like there is explicit cap but the supply will converge to some amount  and Solana will not depreciate like fiat currencies then These price target meme posts are so stupid  You don t care about the Solana project and the amazing stuff being built on top of it  you only care about your stupid trading portfolio and 1 month gains No one knows where the prices are going to go  If you are equally bullish on both RAY and SOL then pooling is a good option  If you think SOL is going to run way more than RAY  maybe just go with staking instead  Because there is a RAY SOL farm  you can stake your LP tokens and gain additional rewards on top of the standard LP rewards  which could potentially more than offset any potential impermanent loss  I personally don t have either asset but I m bullish on both Yes there is a current inflation rate of 7 8  that will eventually decrease to 1 5   However  staking more than offsets this inflation More

your SOL inside of Exodus  you will be supporting our partner Everstake    gt https   support exodus com article 1551 solana staking faqNo idea how reliable they are Is it really an upcoming project  though   It seems like a well established pillar of the Solana ecosystem at this point What do you think my post is  I m asking around   also known as research  I haven t bought any yet Thank you for your detailed explanation  Really appreciated  I m staking via Exodus  they didn t offer me to choose a validator  How does it work in this case  Is it more or less secured Coin go up Lol  Do some research and don t just buy some coin because it s mooning Hi guys  Greetings from Greece  I started investign in crypto about 2 weeks ago and i really liked this project  I m currently holding some solana in  crypto com  https   crypto com  app  Do you have any better recomerecommendations  Also where can i find these other projects based on solana and invest on them  As i am a beginner and i dont know much about crypto  Thanks It is better  But still overly centralized compared to competitors  Imagine that the whole network can be compromized if 10 or 20 nodes are compromised   Whatever the reason  could be power outage  or virus  or network failure  or even byzantine attack maybe  Just for comparison  Ethereum and Avalanche are orders of magnitude more decentralized  therefore safer from this point of view Not working for me either  Bummer Right below that you have an option to restore existing wallet Eth has buncha layer 2s right now  so gas fees can be fixed gt  Although you do have a risk of your funds being slashed when you are    gt    gt staking   gt    gt  with a malicious validator Sorry I don t understand this part If I m staking  I have a risk of my SOL being reduced without me knowing I do both but staking is basically holding plus you are gaining rewards and support securing the network  if you decentralize your stake  Although you do have a risk of your funds being slashed when you are  staking  https   docs solana com staking  with a malicious validator Ahh ok so it looks like the Solana fee was only 0 0002 for the transaction  but I think that the 0 0233 is the exchange fee  This was done on Serum right  That s who the fee went to  Seems high even for the DEX  I ll look into the fee structure and see what that may be  Was this a SOL to wSOL swap You can do both  personally I m holding Yeah  same  I just don t see how BTC is supposed to be a good long term investment at this point since I don t think it s very good fundamentally and technologically as a currency and payment network  A majority of my portfolio is Solana  but my diversification comes from coins that I think have some sort of technical or usecase advantage over BTC I had a roommate try and pay me in pot  I declined  I m betting that pot is worth less today than your SOL  I think I made the right decision Thanks  I did the research    The Fusion Pool gives Dual Yield  however  it doesn t optimize yield automatically The way i see it  After testing out a bunch of cryptos  SOL was the fastest   cheapest  and easiest to move around  I m Just waiting for all the market cap to pour in once the rest of the world realizes it  Looks very Bullish to me we all want that roommate Developers  Developers  Developers   https   youtu be KMU0tzLwhbE I m 100  in SOL You must thank your room mate at the same time a great decision to get paid in SOL  SOL is up nice few   now after few days going down Mango  Oxy It s getting serious  Look at the speakers lineup  Scroll to bottom https   solana com solanaszn I only just heard about this crypto last night It looks to be on a high rn  but you guys think it won t go below 40   i m tempted to buy in when I get paid on thurs Y n Where s the best place to buy from in UK  Coinbase doesn t do it currently They are already here OKex has a direct SOL BTC pair to utilize TS is obviously saying  1 000 with a typo    I am seeing the pricing for Bitcoin is 54 807 33 in coinmarketcap right now Does that mean bitcoin is  54  NO WAY 1 000 is good   2 000 is better haha I m buying and holding SRM        Do you think it can go 20  each  Or it can go higher the SOL in the future close  Thanks FTR bruh https   explorer solana com tx 27V99W6L2JGUZc7wPoJXcrSAkqbHNLv5Kjs9ZYZSiQmX6x7L6WrLonBskU3ySQEuhsgTEGw81kRPSCz3LEvUJjXQ Wow  I d give him a cut if he s a good friend  Keep it if they were a flake lol so happy I bough a bag on Early February and from then I had average about 20 solana per week  buying more today  I am buying it over ETH as well lol What country  Many Reddit readers will not understand 1 000 to mean 1 000  Adding the extra zero at least tipped them off that your math notation was not the same as theirs No worries  good luck  I take my tips in  SOL Well I admit there is typo which I am supposed to say  1 000  This means one thousand which is USA standard Nice I will look into this In my country    1 0000   means  1 dollar as a comma is used for decimal placement   D  For me this guy looks like a total BEAR  and he is so negative about solana 1 0000 is not even a number But is there possible airdrop and how can one get the info early before it s too late I m still new to the Solana  ecosystem   could you explain why you re so bullish on both Solana when there are other competitors that permit an easy and efficient creation of Dapps  And also why are you bullish particularly on Serum  Could you provide some people youtube channels that explain more in details why Solana and Serum are promising  Thanks man Is solana in test net or mainet if you share the transaction hash from the solana explorer would help people look into it more  it may be the collective payment to the signer for signing the entire block  There should be a separate line that reflects your fee Thanks for the tip  I put a couple hundred on that and  it s moving But this is almost 1 dollar transaction fee    this is not small transaction fee    and I just transferred a nominal amount like 10 dollars in this transaction as a test  I might stay away from SOL if every swap costs close to a dollar I m from UK  but I don t see how that would effect the outcome  Please let me know what this is when you get a chance I m kind of a noob  but this is good right  It means more people investing in the project and less centralization It says after 4 days  automatically on 19th April 2021  I staked 12 4897297 SOLtotal shows an increase of  0 03862297 SOL today 28th April 2021 You can swap eth for sol on there  It s backed by serum I think  you can do the same on serum Does Raydium offer a bridge  I have looked through their site and Googled  but it seems that they are just doing Solana I was struggling to find an exchange that would let me buy SOL in the United States until I realized that I can swap using my Exodus wallet  Staking there right now too Raydium No problem 50

the browser window once the wallet has appeared  it prompts me for the password again  Is this how it is expected to work  or should it maintain a logged in state  if so  perhaps this indicates where my issue is  my login is not persisting for some reason yes the minus button next to the stake button is the unstake button  keep in mind for the liquidity pool farms  you have to unstake AND remove everything from the liquidity pool to get it all back into your wallet   this doesnt apply for the RAY only staking though There is a fee with every transaction on solana ecosystem  same as on etheruem  However fees on solana are tiny  typically a few cents  compared to  40 80 gas fees on etheruem At the moment i have SOL VET and HOLO My thoughts  not under 40 I bought it on 47  How should i HOLD it as current price is 41 Feel that dude  I feel the SOL I m thinking we might see a pullback when ethereum 2 0 fixes its gas price problem  but by then we will be nearing 30  of its market cap  2 9x current price   Hopefully ethereum takes its time and people jump ship to Sol SOL is the sleeper  when SOL sleeps it doesn t roll over  When SOL wakes up  SOL rises and rises   100 SOL by end of May  Given total available supply  amp  the fact it challenges ETH big time  It s top 5 market cap coin in due time It might pump again to 50 Oh     OK   solflare com  https   solflare com  works now

month I also use exodus and it is quick and easy to stake  I ve had no problems so far No worries  I m glad you gave it a read through  The difference with Elrond and other layer 2 solutions  is that each shard has its own validator nodes  These nodes are also rotated from shard to shard  This not only gives the system horizontal scalability  but also increases the security even beyond a typical POS consensus system  I m personally not saying that Elrond is better or worse than Solana  Both their approaches are very different  and both projects have effectively created their own unique consensus systems compared to other blockchains  I do believe that Elrond and Solana have the best tech out of all the  MANY  blockchains I have researched so far  For this reason  I keep a hefty bag of both  Solana definitely has the advantage of being located in California  and adoption is far faster than Elrond which is based in Romania  But from a technical perspective  only time will tell which system has more usable advantages  and more crippling disadvantages  In the long run  you may be correct that sharding is over complicated compared to Solanas system  Although there is still a debate about how secure the Solana network is compared to classical POS  But this will likely fade away as slashing is introduced   Personally  I think both of these systems are superior to their competitors  but not necessarily superior to each other  We ll see  Good luck with your trading I just discovered SOL and am extremely excited about it so I bought some  That doesn t mean I am getting rid of my BTC  ETH  ADA  ATOM  VET and ROSE though  they all serve their purpose in my portfolio  They idea of going all in on one coin  shivers My advice is have a good vision on the project and invest in long term  If you focus on the long vision that it will reach certain height  middle dips and bull does not matter at all   Take a look at Bitcoin  How many dips and crash and bull has happened  If someone were to HODL it till at least today  they gain more than what they had traded for previously Yes because its really better than ETH at least for now But this theory also apply to other PoS project  The cost of running a node doesn t matter as it will still be a competition toward the bottom I see   Thank you very much  I will contact them right away i m a beginner in crypto and i bought around 65euros at solana and this recent dip makes me think if i did good or not I hope so  but I would not count on it you think so Exodus is good because they give you your private keys unlike exchanges yes agree with this  just funny to saw some ETH maxis started to badmouth about SOL after the recent pump this year must be a great year for u  congrats Your room mate is indeed your benefactor   ️Solana to  1000 soon Who told you you can send USDT SPL  from Sollet  To Binance Binance does not support SPL Tokens yet If you sent them to your SOL address in Binance  then you have to contact Binance support about that  they are the ones who owns the private keys for that SOL wallet Do it He turned those 65 into more than 300  That can be a significant amount of money for some people  Stop being a douchebag OK well thank you for your well thought out summary   I am not a fan of shard based blockchains so I have some fundamental problems with Elrond that I am unlikely to get past   But I appreciate alot of the other advantages you talked about with regards to how they are building out their ecosystem everyone should have a roommate like yours  but I stay with my family  I am following SOL since it was  30  I am  in it for the long termSee you guys around when price reaches  200 My historical transactions on Solflare aren t showing up today and my wallet balance is ERROR   I tried messaging them on their website and that even failed   I don t fancy joining telegraph just for one message since I have no use for it Does anyone know if Solflare is down or having issues today Keep a journal and log your trades  It s a lifesaver around tax time too When in doubt  put money into whatever Binance is doing haha I don t understand this obsession with holding BTC from people that already know that BTC is becoming more and more obsolete  The only way BTC could survive is wrapped in other chains Watch  coin bureau  on youtube I m going pretty hard right now on it too  nothing wrong with going all In on it imo  I think it is where the demand is headed as well  I keep other similar projects too but less  I think the smart contract ecosystem has room for all and that they will have their moments at different times so I m happy with the diversity  Keeping vechain and theta as well as I believe in their use cases and because they are their own sectors You should not be comparing SOL to ETH today   You should be comparing it to ETH 2 0   SOL will not kill ETH 2 0   ETH is way more secure than SOL and has a giant ecosystem and network effect   You should be asking yourself if SOL will be relevant with the countless other ETH killers that are out there   Why will someone choose SOL over Cardano  Tezos  Avalanche  Zilliqa  DOT  Binanace  etc    That is the question   IMO you should be diversifying with ETH the majority of your portfolio and a smattering of other eth killers as hedges   If you are a cryptography and game theory expert  than by all means put your bet on the technology you know to be superior  but if not  it is risky to put it all on SOL Eth s over priced if you want to double your money this run buy eth if you want to 5x you money buy sol simple I ve seen this when doing too many transactions one after another when delegating or undelegating just wait a bit in between transactions so your wallet can catch up with the network You are a fucking genius Hi guys  original poster here  I highly recommend signing up on  www Gate io  https   www Gate io  It s available in the US  The trading engine and UI is phenomenal and you can buy Solana based coins there  Solana  Kin  Serum are available there  I also recommend buying their exchange token which is ridiculously undervalued in my opinion  It s called GateChain  GT Token   Peace You realize that s not a correct comparison right  We re talking about hardware requirements only  which is separate from the tokens you hold to stake  You can stake run an eth node on a  100 rasberry pi  For solana you ll need to spend  5 10k just on hardware alone You said technology and that include phone So you are saying as long shit coins have services running on them they won t get swapped out Bold claim man Yeah  Raydium is tops  After dabbling with swaps and dexs on Eth over the last few years  Raydium feels like it s from Star Trek Very nice  Quite similar here  Let s go go go  Love  Raydium io  https   Raydium io  which I only found a couple days ago  after much frustration with SolFlare Thanks for the thorough breakdown  That s great I m currently in RAY KIN  RAY OXY  and just started with USDC STEP Yeah it s about how it compounds  If you deposit 100 XYZ at 10  APR and let it sit for a year  without harvesting  i e  the rewards aren t earning anything  then at the end of the year you ll have 100   10 XYZ If you harvest at a frequency of 1 n you ll get 100   1 10  n   n which gets quickly real nice as the rate goes from 10  to the 100   we are seeing  Sweet stuff Downside of harvesting is more taxable recordable transactions  i e  administratively annoying  and tx or network fees  really amazing on solana vs  ETH  This may help   https   www

developer community  so they will keep building amazing infrastructure for DApps  Even if SOL is great in scalability  I don t think SOL will kill ETH  They will co exist  just like Instagram and Twitter  They are both good in their own ways Many of the analogies are not equivalent  Cell phones get swapped out every couple of years  Networks don t You know ETH has layer two solutions  Matic is both fast  and cheap  Other solutions are coming  gt mathematical certaintyErrr what  No it s not  At least not in the short term  Long term  sure  Nothing lives forever I m bullish on Solana  But realistic  It s not going to overtake ETH in this bullrun It s a Sam Coin  sam coins and anything backed by Alameda Research are worth holding a bag of Phones get replaced every few years Networks have services running on them  They don t just get swapped out  like phones do Is there a way to invest in the solstarter project   Could you please list a few options if possible In the world of tech you have something called second mover advantage   Iphone made Blackberry totally irrelevant  Netscape navigator opened the internet and made AOL walled garden irrelevant  Uber made taxi companies irrelevant  Amazon destroyed Barnes and Nobles  Internet Explorer obliterated Netscape  Google killed AltaVista and Yahoo   Paypal made earlier internet payment processors such as iBill obsolete  and Stripe made better APIs than paypal and attracted all the devs   SunMicrosystems and its proprietary Sparks Unix based OS servers that powered the internet went out of business due to Linux running on cheap servers  Examples are endless   First mover can be a big disadvantage in the very fast moving world of tech  where users just want ease of use  speed  security and all for  free or low fees     Eth doesn t satisfy the two most important criteria for users and Devs  Speed and low fees  For that reason  die it will  It s a mathematical certainty Diversify is overrated if you think SOL is the obvious play gt Don t underestimate first mover advantage Don t overestimate first mover advantage Look at Nokia  People use to think Apple will never replace Nokia anytime soon yeah  6 more days for me  no  withdraw  button shows on my staking account Thanks for the input  I had always been under the impression that APY was for the lender and APR was for the borrower  I guess I need to do a little more reading Not to nitpick but rewards are APR not APY  The reason being there is no compounding  unless of course you harvest and add back as often as possible  which in itself improves the return on the assets but does nothing to help IL   At the levels we are talking about APY can be much greater than APR Hey no offense  eat a dick  thanks Binance    here s a referral if you re

another coin before your verification is complete Same at 8 50   _ I asked about this in Raydium Telegram group  once i get the reply you ll be notified May i ask where are you from  because they asked me about this  amp  told them that the OP didn t mention that into Head To SolFlare Telegram Support Group So They Gave You The Best Answer For that   https   t me SolFlare _Wallet  https   t me SolFlare_Wallet Im 100  SOL right now  as far as my crypto investments  I dont really see the point in diversification past bitcoin and etherium right now  since everything else seems to track pretty closely to bitcoin  The volatility will eventually shake the coins loose from each other and then diversification will probably be a smarter play for those less risk averse 2 things from me1  success of SOL doesn t mean death of ETH  Ford  BMW  Audi all can exist in the ecosystem  In fact  compliment each other 2  tech is not equal to gain  If you use an iPhone  go look up it s specs vs some of the smartphones made by Huawei  Xiaomi  Samsung  Bonus  Price is simply a function of supply and demand Supply is affected by the rules of the blockchainDemand     a lot more  Including political interference  amongst others Can t buy more to DCA  It bums me out that I bought near ATH The best wallet is clearly Solflare as it works with Ledger  You can stake and even use their Serum based DEX I just buy more wen its down Its like an errection   doesnt stay hard 24 7 Exactly what I did To be fair  if you thought they d get Joe Biden on the show  I mean come on  I ll say they give decent general advice for new comers  but I wouldn t blindly follow them  Always dyor  They did mention Cardstarter when it was at  2 3  and I made an absolute killing on it Use FTX us How long do these periods of consolidation last  Pardon the question  newbie here How long do dump days last  Been a horrible day for SOL Aliens Im in for a long time not a good time all my room mate ever did was eat my fucking food and leave his trash in the kitchen   LOL What a stud of a room mate you had Sol and Anna RemindMe  1 year  you better have held Looool smart decision Do folks buy solana coin or solana futures Make sure you have at least   0 1 SOL    amp  let us know the result so we can help you even more of things Imo  your simple enough of a person to not catch onto the pun  even when the punchline was italicized for you  when you re that simple in combination with your strong and couldn t be more wrong skill in speculation  in tandem with your projecting  you are not someone to give advice  so Just bought in based on the same prediction Awww baby is hurt and needs a bottle  Try speculating and projecting a little harder Yeah what the fuck happened lol I was JUST looking into getting into this now im not so sure gt  EDIT  resolved  I have managed to receive the tokens back to ETH using the same bridge  Cost me a lot  But learned some lessons  Solana ecosystem looks good  but UI is messy  No information  A lot of confusion  So don t expect degens to ape in yet  Glad to see it worked for you in both ways  the Gas Fees is unfortunately linked to the Ethereum blockchain I think it will have hit  150 between now and 6 months but have no idea if it will still be that high in 6 months  Depends how long the bull market lasts  I think it will be top 5 market cap gt  I want to connect my metamask wallet to use with Solana  don t want to add a different wallet   You can t add Solana blockchain to MtaMask since Soplana isn t a fork of Ethereum  gt  Can I bridge to Solana   Yes you can gt   And if so where    and can I bridge into SOL tokens  Using ETH lt  gt SOl WormHole bridge  through Sollet io Wallet  PS  Remember  to do so you ll need to Cover the ETH Gas Fees while doing so I suppose a validator s incentive to run a public RPC node is based on two factors  1   A desire to strengthen the network  which is in the validator s interest because strong Solana is in their interest 2   A desire to be seen as strengthening the network  which could convince people to stake in that validator because they like validators that strengthen the network Both are kind of second level motivations  there is no direct financial reward for running an RPC node  which is why only a subset of validators do it If users value it though  and make it clear that they do so and will vote with their stake  you d better believe many validators would do it In fact  you ve given me an idea   Maybe I ll enable the public RPC node on my validator and try to get some marketing cred out of it So you don t need a validator to run a full node and participate in transaction and block propagation I think my misunderstanding might just come down to terminology Not a L0 solution though is it   DAG I d recommend staking on Exodus because they give you your private keys so you actually own your crypto unlike on exchanges No   I m talking about validators  the nodes that are run by operators that actually propose blocks and vote on transactions   Running a validator costs about 1 SOL per day in voting fees   But end users do not normally run validators  so they would never pay these fees I have the same problem   cleared cache and now tried to recover and next button is greyed out   I have tried everything and was very careful about the phrase and even wrote it down twice   Did anyone find a solution Down for me to even when checking thru step it doesn t show up I thought the price for 2021 would be  25  Best to buy and hold Well    It s not about making 65 to 300 but rather what is easier to do    Assume you have 65 dollars   path 1 work a few extra hours and earn 65 dollars   gt  now you got 130   path 2 make 200  from investing in cryptocurrency   gt  now now you got 130   In my opinion the first path is way more reasonable  In my first post I was not implying he was poor or that this is low amount of money  but I thought maybe Solana is a small portion of his portfolio yeah i get the same bounce back  yet it worked earlier cry me a river poor boy 100  in 6 months  top 10 So around the  3 coin by market cap in 6 months There Is What We Call WamrUp When You Delegate Your Stake To A Validator  It Takes Around 2   3 Days  it s Called An Epoch  Before Your Stake Enter The Network  amp  Start Getting You The Rewards As  For The UnDelegating You Stake  It Takes The Same Period Of Time  amp  It s Called CoolDown You Can Check When The Epoch Starts  amp  Ends In This Link   https   solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io  gt However  I have 31 7 Sol  I do not really understand    You need to have some SOL in your main SolFare account  even 0 01 SOL is more than enough When ETH 2 0 goes live with POS  there will be over 100 000 validators   With the value of ETH so high  and the required cool down period before removing a stake  it will be nearly impossible to tamper with the blockchain   That is why you are seeing big financial players choosing to build on ETH   That and the composability and network effect   Delegated POS is not as secure   There are less validators and there is the risk of cartel formation   Now Solana might achieve a number validators nodes that almost ensure it s security in the future   At that point you might see big financial players dip their toes in the Solana blockchain  but again they have to choose Solana over another handful of interesting technologies like Cardano  Algorand  Iota  Stellar  etc   That is why network effect is so important   Don t get me wrong  I own SOL and hope it succeeds   I just don t think it makes sense to go all in unless you want to truly gamble It s working for me  If you just want to check stats of your pools and farms  you can use apeboard finance or step finance btw gt  I guess part of me wonders   what if these were active wallets from other people    No  it s not  gt But I doubt they would be recycling the same seed phrases around to people No  that s not what s happening As for the rest  they are working on making it like you said so when you try to restore your wallet  you ll be seeing only your address  no other Multiple Derivable Accounts ThNks In 6 months I d say  300 to  500 I used BTC to buy the SOL so it was sol btc but it will give you the current value in USD too One of the mods mentioend in another post that solana has not implemented slashing to any validators  It s not to say that it can t happen but it hasn t happened yet Where can one buy SPL USDC in NY Both exodus and bitrue state that they are unavailable got NY residents That was a well done video  A whole bunch of copyright infringement but who cares haha gt  You should not be comparing SOL to ETH today  You should be comparing it to ETH 2 0  SOL will not kill ETH 2 0 That s a really good point that I haven t really thought about researched enough  Thanks  gt  ETH is way more secure than SOLAt a high level  why is this  Will ETH 2 0 and the growth of the Solana network  in terms of   of validators  affect this security gap ETH isn t going anywhere anytime soon  At the same time  I really don t see ETH 2 0 as a  Solana killer   Any project as big as Ethereum is bound to have some significant challenges with technical debt and competing interests visions within the community  I m not an expert at all  but it seems like there s a good opportunity for a Solana or something else to grow into a true ETH peer competitor  even factoring in ETH 2 0  Of course it s still risky to bet it all on Solana though Thanks for sharing your thoughts mate guys did you buy solana of ftx us   i cant find usdc there Thanks so much for the kind words  Its crazy how cheap transaction can be on Solana  Ultimately  the more TPS your network can handle  the cheaper you can make the transactions because the whole reason it costs money to do the transaction is really to limit DDOSing spammers putting unneaded transactions on the network  Yes it is nice to pay the node operators a little fee for their time and hardware  but that s very little in comparison I honestly like bitcoin  It scares me how centralized the miners are in china  and we saw from the recent hashing power decrease when 2 Chinese provinces lost power  that this scares institutional investors as well  There are heavy investments being made to increase mining in other areas which could alleviate these concerns Ultimately  I think the value of a network depends on how much it is used or what is can be used for  Bitcoin can be used as a reliable store of value that is time tested  inflationary resistant  and relatively easy to transfer funds to and from entities  However  I think in 10 20 years  when Solana is even more time tested  the usefulness of Bitcoin will dwindle as there are just better  easier  and more decentralized ways to transfer currency same Wow man  WOW    Nice write up dude  This is exactly what I have been telling people  and I love how you explained how the PoH and PoS systems can t keep up  and why  in layman s terms  This project is so exciting  and for those who are coming in just from an investment side  as I ve said anything under  100 is an insane bargain for Sol  Yeah yeah  not financial advice blah blah but seriously   this has no downsides  Every other blockchain has downsides that are critical to worldwide adoption  One thing that didn t touch on I don t think in OP is ETH cost as well  10K transactions are said to cost  1 MILLION dollars on Etherium  and some say it will hit 10k per ETH this year    imagine the cost then  Solana if you were to do 1 million transactions guess how much it cost roughly   10 bucks  I ll give you the fact that Solana is at a lower market cap therefore is bound to be cheaper   but it won t ever cost as much as Etherium in gas price  u cjwill2017  https   www reddit com user cjwill2017   You seem like a smart dude so a little off topic but what are your thoughts on bitcoin  For the same reason  you mentioned Etherium is now playing catch up I could see the same happening to Bitcoin  IT S SO SLOW at like  8 TPS  When we talk world adaptation could something way more powerful than bitcoin end up coming into play  I think it would be harder has some huge money is in BTC Yeah that makes sense  I just had to mention Algorand as a diehard since I think it s worthy of being part of the conversation    you ve definitely piqued my interest in Solana and going to be doing a deep dive into it tonight Haha yes you are right but I was just trying to go down the line of history and use

They could easily pay the 1 SOL  45 per day to route transactions only through their own self trusted validator Do you mean that on Solana you have to pay the network to give you the data you need to verify the state of the blockchain Newbie here trying to learn I mean  can leaders be predetermined  That was my whole point  Many PoS mechanism have solved this and I would have to assume so for a reason  I call it single point of attack because you don t ever have to control attack more than a single pint at any given time   I feel this is becoming semantics it s not wrong at all  My guess is that the assumption is that it would be extremely difficult and unlikely for a hacker to hack all these nodes at the same time Maybe u aeyakovenko has time to give a more detailed answer on this  whether there s any additional magic happening to prevent this kind of issue  I wasn t able to find a preventative mechanism in the docs Don t get me wrong  I m impressed with the Solana project  I just also love Algorand  it has its particular niches that can make it a very successful project as well  I thought it was a disservice to not list it as a leading competitor  Freaking trash like Cardano and XRP almost made me barf gt   an attacker could hypothetically hop from leader to leader  Hypothetically  what type of hardware would the hacker need as in how much faster would it need to be then the hardware of the validators in order to hop from leader to leader   A leader being a single pint of attack is  from what I can tell  a factual statement How is needing to hop from leader to leader a single point of attack That Gas Fees of 0 0078 ETH  20 87 USD   is in the Ethereum Blockchain  so to send your transaction from Ethereum Blockchain to Solana Blockchain   you ll need ETH Gas Fees FIRST for doing so  it has nothing to do with SOL  gt you must already have SOL in your wallet You ll only need like 0 002 SOL in your SOL Wallet for Minting the wETH  Wrapped ETH   gt Below the  amount  box  the max ETH i can convert it 0 1  WhyIt s related to ETH  amp  it s High Gas Fees unfortunately Most people when talking about running a validator are talking about doing so for profit   You are right  someone like VISA could run a completely money losing validator for other reasons   They could easily pay the 1 SOL  45 per day to route transactions only through their own self trusted validator So when I talk about  barrier   I m talking about the barriers that prevent small operators from running validators  which is what is germaine to this discussion  which is about decentralization  which most people think equates to lots of small operators p s  I agree with you that the OP was so full of bad information and assumptions  that I m not even bothering to respond to it directly   Would take too long lol my SOL would be worth like a dollar but its better than nothing BUT so much better than the projects you listed as examples  That was more so my point  Algorand is a better competitor for SOL than the junk you listed Yes  seems like the pools aren t loading either so I m wondering if that is affecting the market s access to liquidity  Not sure https   twitter

000    Thanks to a truthful approach to block pipelining  Every metric above is worse than Solanas True  it is not the most decentralized system  I have added an edit and changed that  It is quite decentralized though  and has potential to be the most decentralized if it continues on its current pace Thanks for point 1 source  In regards to point 2  what ive tried reiterating a number of times to everyone is that I said what I said because I read in a dev forum that the leaders can be predetermined so an attacker could hypothetically hop from leader to leader  Perhaps this is wrong but I m not sure why it s so hard to get that point through  A leader being a single pint of attack is  from what I can tell  a factual statement  The ability to predetermine the leaders would dictate whether it s meaningful or not due to the short interval between leaders The list of judges and speakers is amazing  Good job getting all these people involved First of all  check out the post mortem here https   medium com solana labs mainnet beta stall postmortem ba0c6064e3To address some of your points 1  take down the leader takes down the network  Having a leader does not mean that the leader controls the network  If a leader is down during its slot 400ms  then it won t publish transactions but because the leader is rotated pretty much every slot  the best that attacking a leader gives you is stopping transactions from happening for 400ms  The network will continue to function and process transactions from the next slot onwards  If a leader was rotated every week  that would mean one week without transactions but it s just 400ms  Plus once this is observed  users will remove their delegated stake resulting in the leader being selected less as a leader  So to conclude  having a leader is a point of attack but the result of the attack isn t problematic  probably  This is new tech which is also why it s called mainnet beta  2  the stall happened because the client were buggy  Leader or leaderless doesn t really help there  If validators are running the same client and it has bugs  bad things will happen  no matter on which blockchain  Maybe different client teams like eth has could be a solution here but I havent done enough research into the 1 vs N different clients debate to give a good answer here Let me know how I can support the cause   I have over 100 SOL so if I can vote on something  I will  I just really got into Solana and am not sure how if there is a governance system I have tried to place a limit order on serum directly and the same thing happened again  This gives me very bad vibes about the whole project Guess where the information about your tracked DHS package or Deliveroo are stored  You guessed it  a centralized database the company owns  That means if the company wanted to  they could change that information  Like I said  this is not an issue for companies that are reputable but opens up the playing field for untrusted companies to get going and verify things in a trustless manner  amp  x200B Eventually  even the companies that are reputable will move to a decentralized system because their data then cant get hacked because its secured by a huge network of independent nodes Wheres the misinformation  Still unclear  You must be furious at the info in the ops post lolAlso  why comment on a response without answering anything brought forth in the response lol gt  But that s not even the real barrier  The real barrier is stake  Validators cost money to run   voting requires transaction fees  to the tune of about 1 SOL per day   and as SOL has gone up in price  so has the cost to run validators  It s now outside of the reach of anyone who can t accumulate significant stake I would think there are good reasons one would want to run a fully validating node even if one weren t staking  For instance if you re running a payment processing company and you want to be able to trustlessly receive and settle payments  Or if you re a smart contract company and you need to keep tabs on the health of your smart contract system  Or a block explorer company  etc  gt  Is a network decentralized only if every person who can rub two dimes together has what it takes to join  I don t think so I agree  but saying that Solana is the  MOST decentralized system to ever exist   like OP did  is disingenuous  OP wants me to believe that Solana with its 600 staking validators is  more  decentralized than a system with 100 000  nodes  miners or staking validators  gt  Some entry barriers could actually improve the security and reliability of the network by allowing only dedicated  motivated individuals to join I disagree  There s no reason a blockchain s performance needs to degrade when nodes swap in and out and experience connection issues  Any well written blockchain is resilient to node instability  and my guess is that Solana is no exception  gt  As long as the barrier isn t too high to prevent the hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands or whatever you feel is necessary  to join  then it s fine My personal criteria is whether someone running consumer hardware on a consumer internet connection is able to validate the blockchain and thus be able to make transactions trustlessly  It seems like Solana fits that description  just barely My only real issue was OP saying that Solana is the  MOST decentralized system to ever exist   Solana might be decentralized  enough   but saying that it s more decentralized than say Bitcoin or Ethereum  is propaganda What exactly was my leader theory  It was that leaders are a single point failure for the chain  You explaining that it only lasts 2 seconds doesn t change that or make it incorrect  As I stated  and asked  from what I ve read  leaders can be predetermined so an attacker could theoretically hop from leader to leader   gt you didn t ask anythingYes  amidst your 15 redundant statements I told you why I said what I said  what I read and asked you to show how they are selected In regards to the outage  you went on a tangent about me bringing that up but admittedly arent sure what caused the outage Speaking of hissy fits  would you like to mention the  post mortem on December  one more time   I don t think I ve read it enough yet Be suspect all you want   But stop spreading misinformation   I spend a lot of time trying to educate people here and you are directly working against that  which I resent  and which hopefully comes through in my tone here You didn t  ask  anything about your leader theory   You just stated it like it was fact    To answer your question  leaders are not  selected   The leader schedule is a function of deterministic information available on chain at the beginning of every epoch   Thus all validators compute the same leader schedule and know who is supposed to be the leader  without anyone having to  agree  on it   It s just known  it s a function of several variables that no one controls but just emerge from the behavior of the network If a leader goes completely AWOL  the effect lasts at most 2 seconds   Because that s when the next leader s slot begins  I help a lot of people on this reddit   You can search for my comments  you will see lots covering things that could help you understand I don t have any post mortem from December   I wasn t even using Solana then  I only know about it from what I heard  which was basically what I described   teething pains caused by some kind of software problem  since rectified It s almost like you ve never heard of the amazing tech that is Algorand  C mon man  Cardano and XRP barely deserve mention in this subject  You just listed pretty much the highest market cap coins You cannot lose SOL in this way Slashing is not implemented  and even if it was  it only would be invoked if your validator broke certain rules  about voting for more than one fork at once   or did something nasty like provably tried to hack other validators   It would NOT be invoked just because your validator was offline for some time  even if your validator was offline forever  you wouldn t get slashed The ONLY risk when your validator is down  is that during that time  it is not voting  and thus not earning fees   So you are only risking your profit  you are NOT risking your or others  stake There is another risk though   If you misconfigure things and leave your private keys laying around  you could get hacked and someone could then do all kinds of bad stuff including withdrawing your funds   So your risk is only a security risk  nothing else It is possible to set up a validator so that nothing can be hacked  you control your withdraw account with a paper wallet    I m just saying that the risk is that you could misconfigure it Plus everybody in the telegram group is complaining about issues with Solflare and the support doesn t answer I asked the other person having a hissy fit how leaders are selected  The reason I wrote what I wrote is because I read on a dev channel that leaders can be predetermined which could lead to an attacker hopping from leader to leader  Could very well be wrong  I also asked where the post mortem was on the December outage  One must certainly exist but I can t find it How are leaders selected  Rather than just stating the same sentence in 5 different comments just provide information being asked  Please provide sources for information  As I stated  I read that leaders can be predetermined which is why I said one leader at any time can stop the network  Spend more time showing information of where I m wrong rather than just screaming I m wrong 17 times lol Also please provide the post mortem on the December network outage  I read they would be releasing it back in December but cannot find it I think at this point SolFlare is the only place you can stake  If you want to stake I d recommend just creating a SolFlare wallet and sending your SOL to it  I imagine it s pretty straight forward Good read related to this debate  I think SOL is coming in at an opportune time to be a long term utility chain but I don t think it will rise to the level ETH will  While I think will keep going up  SOL has already 40x this cycle and until some major TVL comes in its going sideways   Coindesk on the Blockchain Race  https   www coindesk com time is running out to win the blockchain race That s some kind of promotion thing  don t expect to earn that long term   They are paying you extra to stake with them  they won t do that forever Makes sense yeah I am looking into it more now  I am actually invested in Fantom and believe it is a very cool project  I just think Solonas finality speeds and number of nodes are elite compared to any other blockchain  I believe Fantom has only 46 nodes which is relatively small considering the token has been on coinbase for 2 years   not sure if their mainnet has been up for that long   https   ftmscan com validators   https   ftmscan com validators    Fantom has a high transaction speed of about 1 second  and can process alot of transactions  That extra  6 second difference from Fantom to Solana could be pivotal on a more capital efficient decentralized exchange The ethereum virtual machine compatibility is very interesting  But I have heard that is actually can be a limiting factor to some applications  I will look into it more You probably don t understand how block slot works   It s is wrong to say or think that  you take down the block leader and take down the network  Absolutely wrong   All the unwritten transactions  not in a block  for a POS blockchain are in mem pool  All nodes including the slot block leader and non slot leaders have access to the mem pool for the purpose of independently validating each transaction  If the transaction is valid  each node add the transaction to its block  So each node does not depend on or copy the block of the block slot leader  Each node validate and build their own block according to the respective blockchain protocol   Why  So that if the block slot leader is down for whatever reason  hardware failure  system hack  etc   a new block slot leader can step in to write the block  The purpose of identifying a single slot leader is to determine which node gets the reward for writing the block  Slot block leader is not there to replicate block to the other nodes  That is not how a decentralized concensus works This is interesting  Shows the dev believes the project is worth at least  2  we are way past that point hahaha This guy gets it  ETH is the decentralized protocol the future financial system is being built on  The ecosystem is thoroughly developed and battle tested which is why major players are building on it  I just don t think it can be replaced and years of development on its ecosystem quickly spun up on another chain  If you truly believe in a tech then make it your biggest bag but don t put all your eggs in one basket Given that  alot of things are open source so it can be copy pasted to a degree  see Binance   Also as long as something is EVM compatible it can thrive in the ecosystem  SOL does appear to have a barrier to entry with hardware which chips away at its decentralized ability  still much better than binance   It basically requires a custom rig enterprise grade server that doesn t really overlap with high end gaming rigs  I m going to pick up some SOL to hedge my bets and I definitely think the price is going to go up  They have great timing in this market and I m happy for everyone that believes in it and are seeing gains  Good yield farming will be needed to pull liquidity though and right now I think polygon has 3x the liquidity of SOL  I think it s going to always be around and be a useful L1 Eth L2 utility chain You know brother when we say diversify is healthy it is true and it will give u a lot of profits  BUT the nice part is that is diversifying ALL IN in all of the projects built on Solana as early as you can  Solana is here to stay and as u say they lead in tech and now have proven their point with a working product that is fantastic  The dream for developers  Good luck bro and Solana to the MOON Your numbers are wrong   it s not  10k  it s closer to  4k  or maybe even a little less if you buy minimum requirements and don t worry as much about future proofing However  that s not even the hard part   The hard part is having good enough network   Solana validators require very consistently fast  always on networks   Really only data centers  cloud or otherwise  provide the necessary network fidelity That itself is a barrier  because only a subset of people would be willing to do the work to get a server set up in a datacenter  or cloud  But that s not even the real barrier   The real barrier is stake   Validators cost money to run   voting requires transaction fees  to the tune of about 1 SOL per day   and as SOL has gone up in price  so has the cost to run validators   It s now outside of the reach of anyone who can t accumulate significant stake This is a problem and it is known and things are being done to try to improve the situation   I wrote more about that here https   www reddit com r solana comments myqfc3 concern_over_the_number_of_validators gvwer65 With regards to these points about  decentralization  though  it s a loaded term and everyone can interpret it differently   Is a network decentralized only if every person who can rub two dimes together has what it takes to join   I don t think so   Some entry barriers could actually improve the security and reliability of the network by allowing only dedicated  motivated individuals to join   As long as the barrier isn t too high to prevent the hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands or whatever you feel is necessary  to join  then it s fine   Solana has almost 600 validators now and that will only grow in future   I don t personally think it has to reach 100 000 to be  decentralized    I actually think it s pretty much already there  but if it were say 2 000 or more  I would feel that the whole issue could be completely put to rest Yes  yes you are  That joke makes it clear Hi staking in my Exodus wallet  I m Dad I m staking in my Exodus wallet  So far so good  It s a great wallet and it s an easy process I have other coins I m staking  I just prefer holding SOL Jesus you re hostile lol  How are leaders selected  I was reading on a dev blog that they can be known in advance allowing an attack to flow from leader to leader Also why did Solana go down for 6 hours in December  I can t seem to find a pist mortem  I m assuming that exists 5 months later  right  Would be suspect if not Why  This is the equivalent of putting your money under the mattress vs  earning interest at 20    Makes no sense to hold Solana was down in December for some hours  teething problems with early software   If you look I ll bet you can find similar examples elsewhere   Did you know that bitcoin was down for 8  hours once This is not to excuse it  but you talk about it like it s a common occurrence or something expected or something   It s not In early March  or maybe February   there was some sort of extra congestion that occurred because of some misconfiguration    someone was flooding the network or something   Solana did not fail in that case  but it did slow down for a few hours until it was figured out Also I ll say it again  you apparently have no idea how Solana works and should stop trying to make theories about what might  take it down  until you have even a basic grasp of things The results are in and seems the world may never truly know  I think two coffees and a beer seems more likely because a couple times he says the coffee was keeping him up  TCAAB everyone It doesn t have it for me You have no idea what you are talking about  sorry Solana leaders get 4 slots in a row  each slot is 0 5 seconds or so   So  take a leader down  and the worst you do is increase latency for transactions by 2 seconds every time that leader s scheduled slots come around  since the next leader will be ready 2 seconds later to execute those transactions Yeah  I already said this on another thread  SOL s inflation is totally under control  There is no reason to not jump in this project  tbh You d think that  but again  there are solutions out there for businesses to use What you re describing is basically the same technology that powers deliveries on DHL  or tracking your food orders via Deliveroo Ever order an apple device  You can track it all the way from its assembly to your house It s nothing new at all VeChain sounds great but it has no USP against cheaper and more established technologies I m happy be proven wrong  The more Crypto as a whole succeeds the better Let s do a reminder for 3 years time  See who s hypothesis was worked out in the end Hmm I thought staking didn t go into effect until January  So of your 6 month stake  you ve only been getting rewards for the last 3 months  That means your 5  APY was really more like 10   which would match what I m getting on SolFlare I haven t actually tried unstaking yet  But do you have your whole balance staked  I suspect you need to have some in your wallet that isn t being staked to cover the fees for unstaking  You may need to send some Solana to your wallet in order to have a balance to unstake Hello  could someone help me with my problem on Solflare  I have staker my Sol with my Ledger key for 5 days but I would like to withdraw them and send them back to my binance account but it still says that there are not enough fees to cover the transaction in Transfer Sol  However  I have 31 7  I do not really understand gt Solana is the fastest  most decentralized system to ever exist I heard that Solana requires  10k server hardware to run a fully verifying node due to extremely high memory and disk requirements  Compare that to less than a thousand dollars for Bitcoin or Ethereum  Is this true  If so  how can Solana be the MOST decentralized Thanks for the response   Yeah  I didn t research about DOT  just thought it was another smart contract plataform You can buy SOL on Binance or Crypto com pretty quickly  they re what I use  so give them a look Well  it s a real question  say it gets damaged in an earthquake or something  Are the Sol gone forever  And will slashing happen if my internet or power goes down  or only if I try some shady stuff to intentionally mess with the network Again you said stellar had 10 20 nodes  It has 117 nodes  50 validators and 67 watchers  Just pointing out where you were incorrect  Solana was down for about 6 hours in December but I can t seem to see where they publicized what happened  which would be unusual and a bit concerning   gt block leader is not a new thingI don t believe I ever stated it to be a new thing  I simply raised a question  Solana uses a leader consensus mechanism  take down the leader and the chain stops  Stellar uses quorum slices that require agreement amongst many validators across many quorems to sign transactions  Take down a validator and consensus can continue  As stated  centralization means 100 different things to 100 different people but I m not sure how you are making such objective claims Serum is amazing an order book Dex that shits gona blow up everyone has just been copying uniswap up untill now and they have gona and created a hole new product thats better Solana versus Fantom is the only comparison I m interested in  You look into that Part of the advantages is that Solana is objectively better with block finality speeds  higher tps  and low fees than most  But if it s not directly EVM compatible and another system is EVM compatible which resolves the other areas too  then Solana is actually at a disadvantage with absorbing existing creations and thus the people behind those creations Make sure to change transportation when the train reachs its final destination at the launch pad List of stellar nodes  Stellar actually has only 51 validator nodes that actually validate transactions   https   stellarbeat io   https   stellarbeat io  I have not seen anything about the Solana network being compromised  Do you have a link Block leader is not a new thing  and is how ETH 2 0 will choose who signs off on the transactions  To be completely honest  I am not sure how the block leader is  kept honest  but I will do more research to understand it  I am sure Vitlaik Buterin and Charles have thought of how it ensures honest validating so I think it is a secure method of decentralization  Proof of history essentially took proof of stake and just made it quicker Thanks for the answer  Just bc you mentioned  do you know any stacking for Solana that doesn t requiere a physical wallet  I ve only seen sollflare so far and I don t have a ledger so I m not able to stack gt  our initial SOL isn t threatened at all So far  Slashing  https   docs solana com proposals slashing   if that s what you re referring too  isn t implemented yet  gt  What if I smash the server to bits with a hammer  Well  that way your friends may get really pissed off  D gt  From my understanding  I need to execute some solana program as well All you have to do is to make sure the ETH transaction went through the ETH blockchain  i mean confirmed   if yes  then nothing else to be done but waiting for the wETH to hit your SPL address If you still have problem receiving your transaction  better contact the Serum support in  Telegram  https   t me ProjectSerum  or Discord   Discord  https   discord gg EDvudv6  is better from my personal experience  since they are the ones running the ETH  lt  gt  Solana WormHole bridge gt 1 000AFAIK   Netherlands  Belgium uses this system Ok so we just miss a few gains if I go down for a few hours  but our initial SOL isn t threatened at all  What if I smash the server to bits with a hammer When that happens  amp  the internet is too slow or the power is down  you ll just be missing some blocks  so less rewards for the valitador Yes it s normal  if you have the  Mnemonic already saved somewhere safe you can   LogOut  amp   Delete Mnemonic    For me personally i don t do that  i only close the browser  amp  it s logged automatically  next time i wanna login there i just write the password  i don t have to import the wallet again using the  Mnemonic Can confirm there will be faeces in my pants if Pancake comes to Solana gt Stellar and ripple have 66 and 75 nodes respectively I believe Stellar has 117 nodes  But regardless you said 10 20  gt They are more centralizedThis is completely subjective  For instance  on Stellar  you have every validator confirming transactions  There is no single point of attack  On Solana you have 1 leader that can compromise the entire network  Didn t that just recently occur  I m not sure how you can just objectively state  they are more centralized The fact that anyone thinks VeChain will still exist really worries me  A quick 10 min google will show you 100s of technologies that do supply chain tracking  A crypto isn t needed to do that  the industry already does it using existing technologies It completely discredits the rest of your post as it makes me feel like you haven t really done much due diligence on the real world implementation of technologies PancakeSwap is the heart of BSC  Binance will do whatever it takes  even by shorting Solana back to  0 01  to prevent PancakeSwap from moving to Solana Been the first Decentralized blockchain to be faster then the centralised is huge Sol will take out BNB in no time Binance is 35 percent for 15 days stake
2021-04-29,44.84995016,46.07149061,40.95098379,There have been days in the short history of Bitcoin  when one mining consortium indeed had  51  or more of the hashing power  but chose not to do the nasty and steal the Bitcoin Is there going to be burn like BNB Assuming the market remains macro bullish  I expect it to enter the top 10 and find a spot near DOT   100 200  CHIA may take Solana s thunder however  It s apparently HUGE in China already  and the main net hasn t even launched If Fred Fumblefurk  who is clueless  operates a node and fails to comply with rules  his stake is supposed to get slashed  Presumably Fred would lose his stake and I would lose my Sol that I staked with him  Perhaps that has not been implemented yet  It would make me careful to try and avoid a node operator without a track record  while still spreading out my staking  But that concentrates stake to the few most heavily staked nodes  and works against the goal of distribution for security If the reward for validators could be tweaked  like the difficulty of mining a block is automatically tweaked in Bitcoin mining  there could always be the optimum number of validators  especially when the node can be a fungible part of a data center  for Sol  as opposed to an Antminer roaring away in someone s basement as part of a Bitcoin mining pool   This requires savvy in psychology and economics  as opposed to the coding skills needed to make the Solana system function  I ve never understood how Solana people  other than developers  make money at the tiny stated cost per transaction  By comparison  First Data  who operate lots of credit card machines for merchants  get like 1  of sales or 25 cents per transaction to handle Visa and the other credit and debit cards  Merchants and consumers would be happy to go to 1 cent or 0 1 cent per transaction  without it dropping to  001 cent or whatever Solana promises Solana is more centralized than some people would prefer  but it is becoming more decentralized each day  To fully understand this  make sure you understand how POS systems and validators function  Then  look at  this  https   www validators app  page which is the list of current Solana validators and each of their current ownership stakes  It would take 1 3 control if the network for a malicious entity to halt it  Keep in mind  this wouldn t allow them to change anything  just halt it  Atm  it would take the top 15 validators to do that  3 months ago  it was only the top 7  So basically  the more validators that pop up and the more people that stake with them  the more decentralized the network A friend of mine has the same issue  Any Sollet devs around that are able to help  What s happening I think people are waiting on btc options right now  Things should shoot up or down after  Think of right now as a middle ground for price  if you re scared it is going to go up then don t buy  If you think it will go down then buy right now  Your instinct is always wrong in crypto so you can always be right This is a good thing for me Did this get resolved Go here  https   www ibm com partnerworld bpdirectory search results business partners undefinedOn parallel chains website they state they are a business partner of IBM and amazon web services  If you go to IBM partner search they do not come up  You can try at the above link  My guess is they just use ibm cloud and amazon web services cloud and then state they are a partner  Also from what I can see  there is no block explorer  They just say they can get 100k tps but theres really no proof  That thing on the website that simulates transaction speed could be nothing more than a sham  Additionally  they don t even have an actual token out on their chain or smart contracts enabled  Their token is just an ERC 20 token that you can only get by doing a fricken bank transfer to the company  Dont believe everything you read on the internet This is not correct   You get APY in pools just by holding LP tokens   https   raydium gitbook io raydium exchange trade and swap trade and swap liquidity pools I saw an article yesterday describing another crypto called  ParallelChain  which is supposed to do 100 000 tps  Is it rolled out or is it vapor ware  How does it compare in security to Solana  How does  Proof of Immutability  compare to  Proof of History You need to stake the LP tokens somewhere to get yield Honestly  I haven t even really dove into dApps  I ve been told I m missing out Maybe you need to activate the tokens you want first before you swap them  amp  x200B Happened to me Use mobile data mobile hotspot and VPN  Should have no issues He s my go too as well and admittedly since watching him regularly my knowledge has come leaps and bounds but I still don t kid myself  a lot of it still goes over my head You ve been more than helpful  thanks a lot When you stake  you are essentially just making money considering the price of SOL stays constant or is increasing  If you have SOL  stake  You are wasting money if you dont  Thanks for asking and let me know if I answered your question Quick query  Who gets the gas fees Absolutely and welcome to the Solana ecosystem    Yeah  pump and dump games suck  It is relatively easy nowadays to find legit projects  If it is in the top 20  has really good partners and alot of devs  and you believe in the mission then I would bet it isnt a scam  Crypto is becoming more and more established as we speak and the true innovative projects are seeping out to the top of coinmarketcap  If you have a wallet that is able to stake  its as easy as finding a pool you want to stake to  choose this based on uptime and fees  choose low fees   Preferably choose a pool that is outside at least the top 50 on https   solanabeach io validators   Inflation is set around 7  and will decrease to 1 5  gradually over the next few years  Currently you can earn over 10  returns from staking to a node  Some great projects I have found are that support are partnered with Solana include Serum  Arweave  Raydium  Akash  Oxygen and Audius They don t have any desire to go back It s Kanye s POWER music video Thats just based completely on how long it takes the exchange to process the transaction  If you do anything in the solona ecosystem like defi or send from wallet to wallet  it will take  4 seconds Bisq USD to BTC anonymous  then swap or trade on cex  No decentralized method to acquire so far BTC is    distributed     Cool okay cool    cool   cool    cool We saw what that truly meant with the recent 40  hashpower drop  from a single province in China in blackout  Almost half of the global BTC hash power is  distributed  amongst miners in one central location Not sure where your new terminology is coming from   but maybe it needs to take into account global distribution too  In a non centralized fashion  You could call it Decentrabuted Distribulized Education is key to understand the space  My go to for unbiased crypto knowledge is coinbureau on yt  Highly recommended Addagio for Strings Truly  the future of all this i think will be multi bridged EVM compatible chains bonding together into a broader meta chain Some of them are cheap  tho questionably centralized  some are insane simply in terms of tx per second  although with low adoption   They all have their strengths  but this is crypto Sometimes we all get weirdly tribal about the projects we follow Since I m fairly new in all of this  I have a question  How would you consider buying some Solana then staking it  Does staking value rises together with Solana or it takes it s worth at the beginning of it   P s  my financial english sucks and I cannot explain it better YaJust generic virus panic alert that document has macros  Being too dumb to parse what they do  just flags as a threat Antivirus software is not a shield  It s an advisor Yeah fees How to make a  100 in Ethereum  start with  200 and do some transactions When I bought earlier this year   75  100 for the next 6 24 months sounded like a pipedream now  I am kind of expecting this prices  and now my bullish range is  350  550 But in all honesty I m on this project long term  until 2025 at the least   I ll be holding SolI could sell 20  of my bags if this hit some of my price targets before 2025 Whats the difference between holding in the liquidity pool and adding to a fusion pool  Does a fusion pool have higher chance at impermanent loss  Or am I misunderstanding all this This guy is on the right side of the IQ bell curve  I middle I m trying to answer this question thoroughly  but I keep having to go through different points to make my argument  Decentralization is a spectrum  There are currently 15 validators that hold 1 3rd of the stake someone correct me if I m wrong  that number used to be a lot less  It s becoming more decentralized if you ask me This is my reaction to basically everything in the crypto space Define centralized I didn t try to purchase it because of the 10billion token supply  500m token supply for solana sometimes feels ridiculous  Try bonfida My reasoning was simple  I wanted to participate in defi   well I did participate  but I was losing money on transactions through metamask  I had known about  SOL so I decided to test it out after looking into it briefly  The technicals are all in the white paper if you head to solana com Lol I m ballz deep in SOL  but why everyone here thinks that SOL is the best thing in the world  You re doing exactly the same   shitting on other great projects just to seek confirmation bias  because you invested in SOL  It s just another blockchain project promoting itself as an ETH ADA DOT killer  I don t really understand what s so unique about it except the transactions per second   Light years ahead   The only thing  which is light years ahead in terms of tech  projects  ecosystem and brainpower is Ethereum  2 0  But I don t see the problem of investing in both ETH and SOL  I don t care which one is better  I m in for the money and as it seems  both of them  especially ETH  are making massive gains By hating on other projects just shows that you don t care about the tech as much as about the profits  but keep using Solana s  light years ahead  tech just to shill  Stop Bears  or haters  Probably both We all gonna have    while these bears try and put us down  Lol LoL you have no idea about the tech Just look at the roadmap see when ethereum promised PoS and then wait a few more years and then a few more  Cardano and many other are using PoS although cardano is using PoS Ouroboros Ethereum without PoS is indeed ancient technology  Smart contracts won t save them if they don t go PoS  proof of stake So please go and short the token so at least you can be honest with your arguments Do you earn anything by running a node  I d be interested in that  I will have to research Just bought some    I ll be happy if it s at  80 in six months   That s a great return  TBH I bought 1 BTC worth at  46 80    Down 10  but I got Interesting   But I don t understand it You don t get what I m saying Cardano has delayed their release of smart contracts like 5 times already  I ve heard rumors it was just delayed again from Q2 to Q4 2021 Sorry if I don t trust their roadmaps even a little at this point  Maybe I ll hop back in during the bear market  But there s way better places to put my money during the bull run IMO From who did you hear that  Not form someone at Cardano I assume  I think you should be wise and check https   roadmap cardano org en goguen  regularly to see where the project stands Ahhh yes  short the platform that released smart contracts in 2015  That s a totally reasonable comparison LOL  The level of progression on ADA is honestly an embarrassment at this point Buy now     and then buy some more later Hot tip  Buy more SOL instead Some exchanges need 20 minutes worth of confirmations for ADA  some 10  it s certainly a lot slower than Solana  AVAX  FTM or Polygon  It s also more expensive than 3 of those 4 as well  When I browse the Cardano block explorers they are all more than 17c  in the most recent block they range from 24 55c You then wrote a bunch of nonsense that you learned from an echo chamber  You realize you are writing in r Solana right   0001c transactions done in seconds  in a very decentralized manner  Did Avalanche cheat  Is Solana cheating Did you ever get this resolved With that argument in mind you should quickly short bitcoin and ethereum What s the title of the original artwork See  you have no idea what are you talking about  the tech obsolete  LolThe speed is no more than 1 min and is the next thing to address after smart contracts  the fees are 0 17c and is a governance thing can be changed at any time  TPS are limited by configuration like the fee  They could cheat like many chains and reduce the block size  reduce the number of validatiors  increase the hw requirements and not be fully decentralized  all this just to be faster and cheaper but they are focused on what s important and not in the make up or the token price  That is because is one of the tech with a better governance in the industry and this will be rewarded  I could be wrong your could be wrong but give them time I think they are 1 4  I don t think their team or research is particularly attractive  and I think a lot of their tech is already obsolete  50c  transactions and 10  minute wait times in 2021  That s not good enough I read the old roadmap that had smart contracts live in Q3 2019 Seriously though  if Ada s reputation wasn t tied to Eth  this project would have died already IMO Don t you understand  that s my entire point  Last I heard  Cardano smart contracts were on the roadmap for Q3 2019 If this project wasn t associated with Eth co founders  it would be below top 50 IMO I see  I was confused  I thought Cardano could do up to 257 TPS  The link you provided says that Cardano is currently tied with BTC for the lowest TPS in crypto of 7  But don t worry  it can easily be scaled up to slightly below Doge TPS of 53  Thanks for pointing out my mistake This would help clear your confusion around less TPS of Cardano https   www reddit com r CryptoCurrency comments mxmh3a in _response _to _the _post _saying _cardano _is _only   https   www reddit com r CryptoCurrency comments mxmh3a in_response_to_the_post_saying_cardano_is_only Unless you re buying in huge amounts   just buy now  otherwise DCA over the next few days weeks depending on your patience Did you try Orca I know for sure that many blockchains are rushing things that are half backed just to make you think they are ahead  There is no blockchain that can have a real use case as a currency because they dont scale well  are slow  TPS arent enough  they are no decentralized etc  including solana It is worthless to have the faster car in blockchain that runs at 50 km h if to compete you need at least 140km h  Right now all the block chains are at 50 or below  And nobody knows how fast they will be in a year or 2  Apply this to crypto   Cardano might not have the faster car now but it excels in everything else  Team  community  researching and tech  Although more tech are still on paper  they still need to deliver  But blockchain is a long term investment considering that the tech now is not being used Again read the paper and understand the tech behind it I am invested in cardano and solana I am not a fanboy or a hater Hi  i am relatively new to crypto and not familiar with solana eco system  i just have some experience with bsc and pancakeswap  What i saw there i a massive amount of scam projects and rug pulls   Also this tg groups are full of kids and scammers   Really sad  It seems that is not the case with solana  Can you split one SOL in smaller parts like btc  ether or not  I also want to buy a token released on Solana and add it to a pool  I allready figured out which wallet i need and how to do that   I invested also relatively small amounts in deflationary meme tokens on bsc but what i see that they are prone to whale pump and dump games that in my opinion will continue forever  Very disappointed in that i must say  Thats why i want to switch to staking on Solana  I think that this blockchain will become very big in the near future  maybe bigger then Ethereum  I regret now that i not bought SOL in january when the price was around 2   Any opinions and advice about staking on Solana would be very appreciated  What profits can i expect  where to watch out for  which projects on Solana are the good ones  also new projects   Like for example Synthetify or Step Finance  This the one i want to invest in and stake   Any other existing or coming worth mentioning  Thank you very much in advance Buy and hold long term I think it will be between 250 and 350 by the end of the year Very good summary  take my award You could wait for a retracement or get in now  either way youll make a profit if you hodl Feel free to run the file without macros and view them just in case  probably false positive Somehow my antivirus

that s not why people invested in it  The reason they invest in it is because it is an established noninflationary store of value  that in and of itself is an attractive use case gt impermanent lossUseful video on this  https   www youtube com watch v 8XJ1MSTEuU0  https   www youtube com watch v 8XJ1MSTEuU0 It s battent moving up and whenever it moves up it always drops at some point  there s no support level 50k txs or vertical scaling is not enough for mass adoption This must ve taken a whole lotta hardwork and time  Kudos I believe the amount of stake delegated on the validator node relates to the probability that one will be a slot leader  I believe that computing power has no influence on the probability of becoming a slot leader Perfect time would have been 6 month ago  But yeah I m with you SOL has so much potential it will grow more No just buy more SOL now  Perfect time to buy What is dipping RAY   I actually hodl SOL but you suggest to do the same with ray is that it Already dipping  Buy big now and watch it spike Yes it s easy indeed  my comment comes from the idea I had that you could only use Solflare with a ledger but everything s done already  Thanks Is there any additional cost related to running the RPC node   Btw  what is your validator name  I want to delegate some of my SOL to you  I want to support you because you are doing a great job here on reddit  learned a lot from you    thank you for that Fuck off Yeah  that makes sense   I kind of get it   Hopefully the high APY on the Raydium pool will outweigh the gain I am not realizing on the   shit   stable coin Errr    ill just get some solana  ok i think my sollet was like yours previously  these days it didnt logged out and it didnt asked for any password  so i found it quite weird I would hit up youtube to watch some videos  it is a very tricky concept to grasp for sure  Basically if value is going up on SOL  impermanent loss doesn t mean you re losing money  you re just not making as much as you would had you just held the SOL token by itself  The pool gets rebalanced as the value of the pair changes  and so if you put 1 Sol    45 USDC in right now  and then sol climbs up to  100   when you withdraw you ll find out you now have less than 1 sol and more than 45 USDC  But that s not taking into account the earnings on the APY  It s very complicated lol   not to mention  the sol you converted to USDC isnt growing in value either 130 in 40 days and  460 EOY  Mark my words Thanks   I need to read up on impermanent loss as I guess I don t fully understand it   I thought impermanent loss only happens  when the value goes down   If USDC is stable and SOL is rising rapidly  how is the impermanent loss occurring I dont know the back reason  but if i send sol from binance to bilaxy it take minutes and if I send iost from binance to my tokenpocket wallet just seconds Trezor doesn t support Solana  unless I m missing something The LP tokens wont change inside your wallet  you have what you have    When you eventually withdraw from liquidity  you should have more value than when you started from the APY  But  with one stablecoin and the other one rising rapidly  be prepared for a lot of impermanent loss  I m not sure if there s any tool like yieldwatch  BSC  on sol chain yet that could help you track this I hope there is going to be a push to lower voting fees for Solana validators   This will change the balance of this equation   If voting fees were 1 10 the cost  then you d need much less initial stake to be profitable  which would allow smaller validators to more easily start up   I support this and have brought the issue up to Solana devs several times   They acknowledge the problem  it s not that there isn t a will to fix this  it s that the resources are just so tight right now with everything going on   I hope that in time the fees will be lower and people like the OP  who I do wish could get their chance to run a validator too  will be able to do so Here s a link to the best explanation I was able to find online    https   raydium gitbook io raydium exchange trade and swap trade and swap liquidity pools  https   raydium gitbook io raydium exchange trade and swap trade and swap liquidity pools Lol it s comedy though  Solana is new and already lightyears ahead but Charles is making metaphors about birds  C mon babe And nice work OP  for promoting a Cardano video in the Solana community  Bad publicity is also publicity Smart contracts haven t been rolled out yet on Cardano  Your comment is baseless There are no SOL USDC farms on Raydium currently   Only pools I think it will be top 10 After reading the comments I can say that nobody here has read a cardano paper or knows or understand the roadmap or the currentsituationol of the project Being right now one step behind means nothing since we are still far from having massive adoptions of use of any blockchain tech Smart contracts are coming next and then they will focus on speed Solana is good but for now doesn t scale horizontally if they don t fix this they are dead  but probably they will manage to do it Ethiopia  now that s a name you want to see on a block chain project https   twitter com despreadteam status 1387057874786938883 s 21 Yes When you provide liquidity there s a few tabs next to it for farms I think Cope  Step  Raydium  Rope  Samoyed  Serum  Solarians NFT   Just the few ones I can remember Are you saying Raydium is built on top of Serum   I just dont know enough about them  is there a resource I can read about these Binance is my go to but ftx is solid as well What s the Apr Maybe ask a friend for sol  you need just a Lil bit or you can get it from binance The names Please what are these other projects under solana Thanks for your help  but there is no SOL USDC farm on Raydium   I m talking about the pools  not the farms They killed poor step Add them to the sol usdc farm USDC swaps aren t possible on trust though Ha thanks for sharing this  I went and read the group  indeed many complaining I don t think many ppl thought we d be talking about 100 usd 6 months ago when sol was at 2 usd  I m going to say in between 250   350 usd I seeeee this makes so much sense  Didn t realize rewards weren t available earlier How is it that Exodus then is providing 10 11  when normal validators only 8 9 100 000  SOL will single handedly annihilate   BTC  ETH and as well as all the other alt coins on the market  SOL is the future  The future is SOL Thank you  Please share with friends and family This is the best thing I ve read on reddit this year Hot take Why dont u believe Thanks for your reply  I appreciate it   I have admittedly spent more time studying Cardano s project and have struggled to fully wrap my head around Solana s proof of history  I ll never forget when SOL first came out and no one was willing to believe they were solving cryptos biggest issues in Layer 1  I took a chance and glad I did  Look at us now On Coinbase it actually is  Except only on their custody service  Essentially they are letting the big whales institutional investors buy before you  haha what a joke     amp  x200B Not sure about Gemini and voyager  Solana is relatively new project and this push near the top ten cryptos will likely trigger more adoption and awareness Tbh one more huge bonus is the gradient color scheme is fucking gorgeous for a their Coin  that alone promises added success Thank you for reading  Was alot of work You re probably right  but at same time this project looks legit and much better them projects like SafeMoon Elon Musk Farm rsrsrs Realistically I think it will ebb and flow and finally consolidate at around 100    But can never be sure with crypto it s so damn unpredictable and volatile Just keep in mind most people get turned off from projects that are being heavily shilled  Definitely not the way to go about it I understand your point  Anyway there is a lot of people sharing this project because they want to get affiliate bonus  I invested an small amount and i m trying to get more MTO by sharing to others that may find the project interesting Yes you said that yesterday  but they way youre going about it spamming it on every sub multiple times a day doesnt strike much confidence  Comes off very shill like This project its very interesting and is using Solana You already spammed this here and every other crypto sub last night  If you have to push something this hard its surely a scam Cardano project management has their priorities completely ass backwards in my opinion  It makes me doubt the actual progress of their tech development at this point  Maybe ADA takes over in the future once they finally release everything  But right now  I see Cardano as a hype coin ahaha Cardano has some interesting tech with two separate blockchain layers on their mainnet  However  since their tech can only process like 257 TPS  it means they are guaranteed to be reliant on layer 2 scaling   which I personally see as a way to bring outdated blockchains to a modern level of functionality  Think Eth 2 0 However  there are a lot of sacrifices to using layer 2 solutions  Especially when elegant layer 1 scaling is now a reality due to projects like Elrond and Solana Dude  This was fuckkng incredible write up  Not only did you explain how blockchains work in a very very digestible and unique way but got me so fuckint hype for SOL  adding more toMy bag   Blessings Solana so go down  ️ and keep up to up   One step down and double step up  80 forward Tortoise and hare would apply if other block chains were rushing sloppy implementation  In fact  I believe that Cardanos implementation will be fundimentally sloppy compared to Solana due to the necessity of using Layer 2  However  this isn t what s happening  There are great projects with successful implementation which appear to be more effective than even Cardanos future plans  And they re functional already Just because Cardano was  the first peer reviewed blockchain  as they love to talk about  doesn t mean they re the  only peer reviewed blockchain  Many blockchains are peer reviewed in 2021  Many white papers are published and reviewed in this space  Also  Git hub is in itself a form of peer review  All these blockchains post their source code  Shit man  I M a peer reviewed author as an engineer  I got published in ASME during my undergrad degree  Peer review on its face doesn t mean something is better or worse than the competition  Again  a lot of claims with nothing to show for it Cardanos mainnet can process 257 transactions per second  Their entire system is based on outdated technology IMO  and I personally think that layer 2 solutions are extremely sloppy when amazing layer 1 scaling blockchains like Solana are on the market now To be honest  I think the crypto bubble will deflate a bit in September when student loans have to start being paid back  Also people will be vaxxed by then and will spend on other things besides crypto   like restaurants  bars  travel  commute  etc  20 30 year olds will have less disposable income to keep the bubble going up So crypto might drop  but I think Solana will be one of the better performers  like chainlink during the last bear market I have plenty of gas on metamask for this transaction  Someone raised the same issue on sollet github  https   github com project serum spl token wallet issues 194  https   github com project serum spl token wallet issues 194 Ambiguous as it may be  I m reminded of the story of the tortoise and the hare  Cardano  amp  IOHK have published over 100 academically cited research papers  Ouroboros is the second most cited academic paper on Proof of Stake to date  Granted  the technical solutions between SOL and ADA are different  Cardano is hardly dinking around  I love both projects  just have a hard time understanding why so many are discouraged with Cardano s progress  Mass adoption isn t here yet  and won t be for several years  If this is true  then it s safe to say it doesn t matter what stage of development any one project is in  Look at ETH rn    then again  maybe best not to get into that  Lol cheers to good times ahead Instead of proper smart contract feature   Cardano s blockchain feature seem to be more suitable for serving dictatorship   The Africa project is more like a nationwide censorship implementation Why isn t it available on coinbase  Gemini  or voyager Others will be higher too It s gonna rocket over the summer  If the whole market goes bananas like we think it will  gt 300  is possible Signed up Yes  Solana has the supply limit  total supply  494 098 000 million I have a question about the hardware requirements  The solana website says that you need a ryzen threadripper 3 series with 128 gb of ram  with expansion up to 256   That is not a  500 600 computer as is stated by OP  Also how does computing power relate to the probability that one will be a slot leader  I ve heard Anatoly describe the proof of history algorithm as a race between computers  if you have more power are you more like to be a slot leader and make blocks Severely outdated main net  Please elaborate The plan was to sell some KIN so I could buy some SOL  This just sucks  Wasted SOL adding assets and trying to sell  Can t move kin to bitthumb  can t buy SOL Coinex has a freaking  50  minimum bitcoin deposit  Wild I only need such a small amount of SOLq and there s no way to just buy that Very cool tech  tps of only 4 500 and finality time of around 3 seconds  Not quick enough for fast applications like a decentralized exchange  SOL seems to be better in nearly every way Everything shows up in  step finance  https   step finance  except the fusion pools Uh  dude I m a Solana fan but Charles just signed a deal with Ethiopia enabling 5 million students to use blockchain technology  It s an actual real world use serving millions of people and will enable Ethiopia to advance their education system over the next decade plus  It s a lil more than just birds at this point There was a UI issue and the devs fixed it  It s back up and functional Devs fixed the UI issue  everything is functioning now Very good reply  you laid it out warts and all Same here They have identified the issue and the core team is working on fixing it  got this from admin in the raydium discord General channel I ve also had this problem both yesterday and today   assuming they are getting more traffic than they can handle  I did get through eventually yesterday just had to keep trying  No luck so far today What are your thoughts on AVAX Solana belongs in the top 5  It s only a matter of time IMO Ok fair enough  You have a good eye Yeahhh  I sincerely don t get enjoyment out of shitting on other projects  I want to see as many people get into crypto as possible But I can t help but notice every time I look into Cardano  this guy is spewing out some inspirational BS that has nothing to do with improving his blockchain  Or talking about birds LOL Their announcements on blockfolio are always like  BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD Or  IMAGINE THE WORLD WHEN EVERYONE CAN ACCESS BLOCKCHAIN   I swear  if Eth founders weren t on board to hype this project  I don t think it would even be top 50  Much less top 10 Solana has tech that works NOW  They re so far ahead of Cardanos development  I m not sure how Ada can ever catch up  Once people realize how functional Solana is at this very moment  I see it easily passing Cardanos market cap Im getting this and losing my mind bc im trying to get setup for the first time Trade BTC for it on binance Ugh dude  I ve been skeptical about Cardano for years  The only promises their team seems to keep  is their delays Not to mention their mainnet is severely outdated  and the success of their project is entirely dependent on layer 2 scaling which they haven t even implemented on the test net  Not trying to be a hater  I just think Cardano is the most overrated project in the top 20  besides doge of course Ftx us  or blockfolio gt Imo  your simple enough of a person to not catch onto the pun  even when the punchline was italicized for you  when you re that simple in combination with your strong and couldn t be more wrong skill in speculation  in tandem with your projecting  you are not someone to give advice  so              I asked a legit question about why is it even worth bothering with low sums of money  but apparently you cant even fathom the idea if someone questioning your actions gt I am currently using a  sollet io  https   sollet io   wallet and I would like to stake my SOL on Solflare  Is there a way to import my wallet there    gt    gt I obviously need a   keystore   file to import a wallet  Can I export this   from      sollet io    https   sollet io   Unfortunately this can t be done yet  the only thing available is a private key  that  array of numbers you talked about  If you re a developer you may use this tool  some talked about in Solana Discord  https   github com vidorge solflare decrypt  https   github com vidorge solflare decrypt Ahh gotcha  glad it worked out and I m definitely checking this out Quickly and in large amounts please But now losing too much time at work watching it do nothing     should delete my app for a month moonpay  https   www moonpay com Yep that s why I said around binance us You re assuming the top coins aren t increasing as well What return are you getting gt Where is the best place to buy SOL to send to my Sollet  Any wallet   exchange that support SOL can be a good place to Send   Receive your SOL to Sollet or any other SOL address  gt I want to add a token to my wallet that I ve received but it says I would need Sol in order to do so Adding a token  SPL  to your Sollet Wallet will cost you   0 002 SOL      The Transaction Fees     0 000005 SOL    Let s say you add like 0 01 SOL to your Sollet Wallet before sending any token to it Sometime a simple F5 will solve the problem  Glad you shared with the community how you fixed that error Raydium tweeted today that they are having some slow down issues due to the rapid growth in users   They confirmed that all funds are safe   Read through this thread https   twitter com raydiumprotocol status 1387858327900606464 s 21 AwesomeThanks Hey man  us followers will just keep getting it on sale while we can right     It is interesting though  Let me PM you a site I use to see who s holding what   super useful I think you might like it It s crazy how they did another Hackathon in less then 2 months   These guys are here to stay  Go Solana So a specific example would be how SOL is listed on Binance  but none of the SPL tokens that operate on the SOL blockchain are listed on Binance  No Serum  Kin  or Audius  etc   Basically until Binance decideds to integrate support for SPL tokens  none of the projects that chose to build on Solana can get listed on the exchange Go to this link   https   www binance com en chat  https   www binance com en chat    amp  chose the choice like this picture  amp  see where will that leads you  https   imgur com aFCIpqh  https   imgur com aFCIpqh Just to let you know  I managed to fix it  not sure where was the problem  but what I did is  I refreshed serum  reconnect to serum    reconnect to ledger through phantom  and then settled  amount went through Okay  I might have to do some reading up on that     Sorry not fully across how that side of things works  So just as a high level would an example be an exchange that  provides Solana     but they don t provide all of Solana ecosystem  like serum  band  audius  etc  I feel like I m completely off the mark  But from my knowledge  you can t buy an ERC 20 directly right  It s just the protocol that the project used on the Ethereum network  amp  x200B If you CBF explaining this to me just tell me to do my own research it s all good haha awesome article  i am looking for a mentor lou   btclou777 gmail com ERC20 is a smart contracts token standard  Almost all projects running on Ethereum use ERC20 standard  SPL is the token standard for Solana injective protocol  solana  chain link I ve tried it just keeps going to their annoying chat bot and tells you to leave a message   do you know a better way I agree Solana is has some upwards momentum  My best guess is that one or two of the big exchanges is stocking up preparing for a launch  The fact SOL is not on Coinbase or Kraken is crazy Agreed  I think that s a great idea Rightttt that makes sense  Thanks mate Ahhhh right   thanks for the clarity I guess my next question would be isn t ERC20 just the tokenomics protocol for ethereum  So is his question regarding DEX s exchanges or something The Solana team may  amp  may not be pushing this  but this is something the Solana community should do  tweeting about it in the major exchanges social media account with a HasTag like this for example    Add _Solana _SPL   It s our duty to do this without waiting the team no TXID means the transaction didn t go through  meaning it s still there in your wallet  contact the Binance support for that Dude lol don t listen to YouTubers  I haven t found one yet that isn t out to fill their own pockets  You have to understand they are just well spoken salesmen They buy alts low  it takes days to put out a YT video usually  they pump it up and get everyone excited and will use bait phrases like ALT SEASON  THIS COIN WILL MOON  next 100X ALTS hell I ve even seen knobs call the next  1 000x alts   Then you guys  eat the sht  they feed you so to speak     anddd they sell or get a nice pump on their new investment  No one  especially YouTubers and Twitter people understand what is going to happen in the market next  Them saying this stuff creates FOMO with you new guys and going out to buy bad deals  While YouTubers and writing their scripts  editing their videos and working on their own buys   real analysis and already making real moves   amp  x200B Just a friendly word of advice so you don t get burned man  You do you of course  but if any channels you watch use that kind of catch phrases I d un sub and keep scrolling I m hoping Coinbase does it but I expect them to drag their feet  If they allow both free USDC purchases AND instant withdrawals there s no reason to use Coinbase Pro ever again Ok so to follow up my Binance account is still showing the full balance of SOL so I m assuming it s still registered in their system but I can t find anywhere to cancel it  And I can t seem to figure out how to attach screenshots but there s nothing I can show beyond that error message anyway I know you mean for other people and for mass adoption   but for me   I hold theMajority of my coins in exodus  before I found out about solana and it s imminent takeover   and I was pleasantly surprised tk be able to swap dollar for dollar any thing I wanted to and the eth gas was 5 6  max each time   And then stake within exodus for 11   Love soalana Also a note there s no txid in simplest terms  SPL is solana s version of ERC20 on ethereum Other projects that build on the Solana blockchain are SPL  Solana Program Library  Tokens  Basically think Ethereum  amp  ERC 20 are like Solana  amp  SPL Interesting  this is news to me as well  The market could see dips tomorrow  Although per BTC market cap the options seem quite small it does create panic sometimes and could see a market drop   10  again  That said  if we look at the last two big market dips we have had this fortnight  SOL went up in every single one while all others crashed  We are also seeing Solana pullback over the past 3 days due to the big pump we just came off and finding ground again  I would say as just something to consider perhaps buying 25   depending on your spend size this could be more or less  of your planned total buy today   see what the market does and continue to monitor over the next 24 hours Unfortunately  without a use case the price will crash  what I m saying that to only rely on speculative pressure without spl tokens being listed on exchanges also will end badly  solana needs ppl paying for transactions to sustain these prices  most exchanges aren t supporting spl tokens yet   nobody is paying sol to exchange tokens and the bubble will burst when ppl realize this Warning  this looks like a SCAM    This info is not on official website   https   solstarter org   https   solstarter org     not on their twitter    be careful Compare it to the volume on Coinbase or Binance I don t think it s a wallet problem because the balance is still showing on Binance spot This is a very good point   When there are multiple competing implementations of the Solana software in use  from different sources  that will be a big milestone in decentralization SPL as in the simplicity token  What do they have to do with the Solana team or am I missing something Compare its volume to Coinbase or Binance I do Why do you think that about Chia   I m not doubting it  I have no idea   I just don t understand what goes into the thought process of  I am not familiar with either project but I think it s top 10 https   twitter com killshotcrypto status 1387562422861402118 s 21 Stay in school  do your homework  and eat your veggies    That s my advice Lukso will reach 100 first To answer your second question  I think that one thing that people can do is contact their exchanges and let them know that you want need Solana support   And let them know that you are considering using a different exchange that does support Solana Umm   FTX About a night of work  Thank you Gate io is the  7 exchange listed on coinmarketcsp and it has SPL based tokens in there you must contact the support of your wallet Ever heard of Blockfolio   lol I am looking forward to the dip so I can grab some Thanks for this Ill get some screens asap Math Wallet Because it s the fastest while we are waiting on ethereum to scale Solana is working way better than ethereum 2 0 promise to do  And it s not an proof of authority centralized solution like binance smart chain What is the wallet you use Buy on ftxBinance withdraw fee is expensiveIf FTX doesn t support your money  buy xrp on binance and send to FTX Lol that s the kind of stuff that happens when I fiddle with stuff too  oh yeah let me clean this up    BAM now it s on all of them lol Hey  I hope your post gets more visibility so that someone expert can weigh in  but hopefully the problem itself is resolvable I don t have experience with this  but a search for your error message eventually leads to these  API docs  https   binance docs github io apidocs spot en  signed trade user_data and margin endpoint security   which seem to hint that Binance needs your browser to send a Signature parameter somewhere in the request URL  hence the  null  debug object  The endpoint seems to be near the beginning of the full request path to withdrawing your tokens  so hopefully nothing in your Binance account has actually been withdrawn yet  This is not professional advice  but maybe it s safe to somehow cancel the withdraw request and try again  I m not familiar with the Binance UI  I m trying out Coinbase   gt  Bilaxy   gt  Sollet atm  but hopefully it s just a button click away On the less risky side  could you post a screenshot of the error message with all personal info blacked out  Might lead to more clues for devs Is that your sollet wallet if yes  does that show up in all browsers you re using or just the browser you re using right now   what browser you re using by the way Fusion pools give rewards in the tokens put into them  which are allocated by the developers for that specific purpose  They re a way to incentivize liquidity building and hodling for relatively younger tokens Cause anyone can start a node and earn that money It there in the     Wallet Balance     section Imgur  https   imgur com lbLRLyM Go to the raydium trading section Teams or single developers create applications within the solana ecosystem for a set period of time  This serves to expand the ecosystem  Developers are incentivized via rewards Use a vpn Nice  I had a feeling that was the problem  Like I said  happened to me yesterday and got me a little nervous till I noticed the LP was there on Sollet  haha I couldn t find that  I saw that in serum but couldn t find in Raydium Its a hell of alot more decentralized then Bitcoin and Etheruem where half of it is ran by alittle town in china which they manipulated the price by shutting down there mining rigs Im sure someone else can go into more detail for you but its decentralized and nothing like BNB or bitcoin or eth or xrp Solana is also kinda centralized as I read Let me know if  this article  https   www coindesk com bitcoin options market eyes 4 2b expiry on friday  helps Binance will never beat Beat Etheruem its centralised and the tech is not a great deal better Solana is the ONLY  live blockchain out there that has a real good chance to beat Eth based on tech What other crypto s pay their validators in addition to the protocol payouts  As far as I know  the mature proof of stake protocols that Solana wants to compete with  like Polkadot  Tezos  or Cardano  only provide the protocol payouts  no direct compensation from their organization that can pick and choose who to pay  Until the protocol is self sustaining  Solana does not seem decentralized to me  Currently  how is this any different from Visa Yeah buy all the biggest YouTubers iv been watching with millions of followers have been saying we brought Solana and were waiting for abit of a dip and going to buy heaps more so any dip will be followed by some great price action up i believe Thanks mate Have you tried clicking on the     Settle     button  So you can later on be able to sen those token back to your Solong wallet Do you mind explaining this  I tried reading articles about BTC options expiring but couldn t fully understand it  How does that effect the market Just like every other blockchain  I do believe there should be some incentive to actually host a node  XRP and Ripple say that hosting a node is a public service  The only problem with that is only big companies have enough capital to invest in a node and not get any monetary value in return We need some sort of incentive for node operators  and node rewards is one of them  The incentive program you listed will help the node network grow  As stated in the document  these incentives will end and the network will grow organically In other words  its just a jumpstart Thanks for the question Yeah  I agree with all of this   Keep checking your wallet   Very unlikely that the money just disappeared   Solana is new  which means that a lot of the infrastructure is clunky   That will change over time and one day we ll all be rich because we were early to the game   Solana is the Ethereum killer   See you at the country club Not likely  Money doesn t disappear from a blockchain unless you send it to an address that isn t yours  Raydium has been having some issues lately  Give it some time and go back and try again later  For half a day my LP wasn t even registering on the website  If you go to your wallet  it will show up thre  I use Sollet and when i went to  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  it showed up as being in my wallet still It s my understanding that through the proof of history the transactions have some indication of order which make it so the validators have to do less block to do a confirmation  That s what makes it different Yep  but when the price of SOL goes down yuo get more SOL tokens  so we have to decide how important the liquidity of SOL is in a decentralized community versus our own short term financial profit  Everyone s decision will be different in the end gt What do you make of the fact that some fraction of those 600 validators are currently being compensated by Solana     gt    gt https   forums solana com t summary of validator compensation programs 1269   gt    gt  It would be helpful to know what fraction of those 600 validators are currently being paid or operated by the Solana foundation and whether those compensated validator nodes

can then be staked in farms to get extra returns  those farms have no risk of IL but i am not sure how those farms are used to create the returns  tbh hm  Sell signal It would compromise decentralization having bigger blocks  Ironically  more than half of the mining in Bitcoin is done by a few companies in China  Solana has 600 nodes distributed around the world  The 15 biggest nodes concentrate less than a third of the stake and the proportion is getting smaller long term Interesting  this makes sense  Shamefully I am not very familiar with either project but from what I do know it seems obvious Sol is a top ten  I think Chia may be too  but it s too early to speculate that I believe you can remove the liquidity  which would give you back the value of SOL  amp  USDC that you have tied up in the LP token   Then you can swap the USDC for SOL Yes of course  as long as you re sending to your SOL address in SolFlare  amp  it will work with every SOL address out there  Wallets  exchanges gt No problem   Since writing this I actually learned a bit more   Because USDC is a stable coin and it s value stays pegged at    1  and Solana s value is going up rapidly we are experiencing something called  Impermanent Loss    Basically  because half our LP token s value is tied up in a coin that does not go up in value we are missing out on the gains we would realize if we just held 100  of the value in SOL   We need to weigh our gains in APY against our unrealized gains   Here s a link to an article that explains it better than I ever could   https   blog bancor network beginners guide to getting rekt by impermanent loss 7c9510cb2f22Is there a way to swap USDC SOL token to SOL Yes  I picked up another  500 yesterday  If I had more  I d prolly bump to  2K The tech sounds solid and the people behind it are legit  I did a fair bit of homework   BUT  ultimately  who the fuck knows My guess   cracks  100 by end of the year No problem   Since writing this I

been discussing this at length   And while the architecture isn t the same  there are similarities   Nano is fee less btw  so even more prone to spam That said  at least with Nano  this is widely viewed to be some kind of irrational fear   Storage is cheap and will likely continue to be cheap for the foreseeable future   In Nano  where there is little incentive to run a node  it s even more critical to focus on this topic Again  with Nano  the long term solution has been to allow nodes to prune   You ll likely have historical nodes as well that keep the entire chain for all accounts  but with Nano  you only need the account chain s latest block   So  you can prune very aggressively  while not affecting the network  Im guessing Solana can do something similar   But at any rate  I think this whole spam discussion  outside of performance implications  is massively overblown That s what I thought  thanks for doing the heavy lifting and tracking it all to make sure I just wish their documentation contains more then just a hello world incrementer BTW this community needs more shitposting  I have been doing my fair share  glad to have you with us Let s agree to disagree  I respect your opinion September 16th It s just normal movement  Traders sell  investors accumulate and stake  causing sideways movement for awhile  until there is a lack of supply due to investors holding in cold wallets or staking  then it has a big move up  Rinse repeat Serum or Raydium Idk but the jump from  50 to  100 is going to be extremely rapid If it keeps going as unstoppable as it has done from start of this year  it will get there before this year ends  But who knows these things things i bought it on Raydium on the USDC pair I believe a hackathon is when programmers congregate and work in teams to create some cool software in a short limited amount of time This is a normal question that most of us make when we are eager to earn money  but for our  own good  we should look at the bigger picture  so we don t get up on this kind of fomo thinking  What I means is this  All legit and serious projects that will survive and thrive in crypto through the decade will eventually go x50 or maybe x100  Who knows what will happen in 5 10 years when we ll enter the phase of major adoption  Maybe it will go even beyond that  The increase is exponential  TL DR  When Solana reaches 500  in 2025  will it matter if you bought at 40  or 50 Had four of them with breakfast yesterday  High blood sugar afterward was the proof Very hard to listento this guy  He make my head hurt  Bad English I am not in a position to comment specifically about Solana but I would like to add that there are many  many other aspects of  decentralization  that goes far beyond validation and confirmation  Development  in my mind  is perhaps one of the more important ones  If you have a single person or team responsible for nearly all the development this is probably worse than having centralization in mining or validating
2021-04-30,42.5000457,44.27015223,41.24350335,I don t think that the Solana value depend on being a Parachain on Polkadot I think Solana will add more value to Polkadot if Polkadot integrate Solana into their ecosystem  bridge or example I think algorand is way under valued I bought some at the ATH  so I paid the high price at that moment  Now the dips are higher than when I bought at the highest   So really the best time is now I know  I hold HBAR  but the conversations in that sub are annoying  I think BTC maxis are the worst though Thank you so much for the in depth insight  I m happy to be here with you and I do agree that it s our job to keep things decentralized   With that being said  SolFlare sounds like what I ve been looking for   Is it difficult to setup   I was on their site and it mentioned something about having to create a key and have a ledger   I don t have a ledger which is why I was using Trust Wallet but if I need one for SolFlare I can get one   Any tutorial or insight would really be helpful if you are able to   Appreciate it again https   ftx com en volume monitor Where are you pulling this data from Uphold Hey  how do you see that 52 second figure you are talking about https   twitter com killshotcrypto status 1387562422861402118 s 21 You don t wanna use exodus as an exchange anyways  Their fees are too high  Great wallet besides that tho 41  42 has been holding all week and I think that will be support  I would buy now and avg down at the mid 30s if  41 doesn t hold Honestly the Exodus exchange is not too terrible if you use XLM  I ve done that a couple of times this week and managed to pay around like a dollar for exchanging around 100 dollars worth  Not great but easy if you already have exodus I sent Solana from my Trust Wallet  and the time of the transaction was 52 seconds  https   explorer solana com tx 2WC2LVNoAYm1xaRPaLfgiv4Txg3vMkE9RDwgXJuXdcP4oRERZZjHF4Q4QQQjAXgYkRceR3m4oxyKSE7PVokGnGey  https   explorer solana

solana  if you have any questions or concerns For some reason it s  not supported in my area What It was a Binance issue in the end they never specified exactly what happened but I m assuming it was probably just network congestion or something Glad it s solved  Good luck  Thank you for updating your post so others get the benefits in the future Thanks for your help man I got it sorted in the end Ethereum in 6 years  it ll probably be sooner but I was exaggerating for the sake of humor   Elrond  crypto com  polygon and many others are all doing more or less the same thing As for stacking up  imo they re looking like they re going to lead the way What s happened Biggest downsides of Solana from what I ve gathered 1  High entry barrier for nodes   Requires high end computer   3k  ish or  500 for a dedicated machine  to run a validator node  This should limit decentralization for a awhile  Personally  I see this as not as a large issue because computer hardware is improving exponentially fast and it is actually much cheaper than mining Bitcoin or Ethereum 2  Network and tech is young   Not battle tested  We don t know if there might be security issues one day 3  Slashing is not automated   Not yet at least  this is in development  meaning while the design is becoming decentralized and the plan is decentralization  right now the network must manually perform the punishment of bad actors making it centralized  Essentially the problems boil down to being a new blockchain Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age

concerns Did you find any solution  I Swapped USDC   gt  MEDIA tokens    the  300 UCDC gone and no MEDIA Tokens received  Anyone that can help me It would take a bloody ass crypto market to pull this down    or maybe not  Last time things got bloody it was green UBXT   Upbots No you can t  need to withdraw to MetaMask or ftx Can I withdraw SPL USDC directly to coinbase  Can I choose ERC 20 on the sollet io wallet AFAIK Algorand is getting an upgrade soon which boosts their TPS and reduces transaction finality time to   2 5s  Still not as fast as Solana but neverless quite respectable Solana  Better performance  More decentralized Good to see someone share their opinion that holds both  Too often people put down other blockchains they don t like for whatever reason Please use solflare  To my knowledge its the only way to actually choose your nodes you stake to  We need to keep this community decentralized and in my opinion it is our job as token holders to do so  Choose a node low on the list of  https   solanabeach io validators  https   solanabeach io validators  and one with a low fee  0 1  so you get the most bang for your buck    Also  staking through an exchange or wallet like exodus will always give you less return    Solflare is a bit glitchy to get the staking wallet made and everything but took me about 10 minutes  You can t screw it up but you might have to try to send your sol to your staking wallet a few times  Good luck and happy staking    welcome to SOL Yh I hold everything you mentioned lmao  I don t get why people feel the need to put everything into one project when clearly diversifying is best I will buy again round 41 42 he meant that he buys bags  and that s it or just use your normal exchange and trade swap into SOL with Raydium or SERUM  But you will have to pay ethereum gas fees once FTX us  https   FTX us  or FTX if you have a vpn The first one  Or the HBAR fans who literally use the phrase  ultcoin  to describe their chosen project  Or the BTC maxis or the ETH maxis  they come in many flavors  For the record I m holding a decent amount of ADA too  Not everyone in it is a cultist Agreed The diversity of use cases for DLT is great enough that no one solution will obviously meet all requirements optimally  Moreover the superiority of DLT over corresponding centralized technology is obvious enough that demand for it will continue to explode and no one system will be able to satisfy that demand My bad  I see it now   Ok they have the stablecoins  that is good  But still   Very little been built on algo compared to orher competitors  I think algo will just be a  niche  blockchain  I believe Sol could be the 2nd biggest blockchain after eth Yeh  do you mean maximalism in a single project  like the ADA cultists  or maximalism in blockchain as a whole  I m guessing you meant the first one Looks to be a bullish pennant forming on the 1 day chart  Big push up soon hopefully Oh it s solidly mid cap  don t get me wrong  I said  people are sleeping on it  not that it s a sleeper haha 3 5B wouldn t fall into a sleeper for me haha I ve tried that  I ve also tried using the wormhole website  I see metamask is connected but it just isn t working Algo has both usdt and usdc But the chain is not buggy   Solana is made for building services on   Solana is humming along handling transactions just fine The services built on Solana are buggy  some of them    Those can and should improve   Recently there was some difficulty because alot of these higher level services  Raydium  Serum  were built quickly without considering some aspects of scaling properly   And they ran into some scaling problems  some of which were fixed already and the rest  likely fixed soon I also need clarification  I don t understand that statement Dapps are literally the entire point of crypto idk how that s possible tbh Buy and hold gt  Anyone engaging in blockchain maximalism in 2021 is  I think  living in the past We need more comments like this C mon queasybot  you can do better than that I got in at the current price level  The chain is buggy as fuck  transactions sometimes just dont go through and balances display wrong on apps  but when it works MAN it feels good to see  sent      complete  with near zero fees    just hope they can get the kinks worked out You need to add   Wrapped Ethereum  Sollet   ETH    to your Sollet account like this Wrapped Ethereum  Sollet   ETH  Imgur  https   imgur com gfJeQT3 USD Coin  USDC  Imgur  https   imgur com lC3FPGF It will cost you like 0 002 SOL for doing so Make sure to have the right ETH Gas fees to cover the transaction  because it will need to be confirmed in the Ethereum Blockchain first before it gets through the WormHole bridge so you receive it in your Sollet wallet lol what do you want mentored on That Sol to mu knowing is the only blockchain apart from eth that has usdt and usdc as stablecoins speaks for it self  Algo had a lot of time to grow   Nothing happened   Avax  founder is arrogant   they had a issue on the mainnet and lost many peoples trust  I am personaly in for 3 blockchains  sol  egld  ftm When you link your Wallet to Step Finance or any other Solana based Dex  you ll have such window or popup that need to be staying opened  like this  Imgur  https   imgur com sl5Um4u it says     Please keep this window open in the background     gt also if i try to trade it back to USDT it says I need to approve transactions on the wallet but I cannot see anywhere on the wallet where it says to approve transactions A new popup   window should open  amp  have an     Approve     button I think it s solid in general  A few of my friends who are deep in crypto told me they re not profit taking until at least 3 digits  I m up from when they told me to buy at like 30 some dollars I would agree with the statement that you cant send usdc from sollet to binance because that would be an spl token and binance doesn t support it Unfortunately I am not completely sure you can recover the funds  you may want to reach out to binance  Not sure if other folks have had a similar experience  Sorry mate  hopefully you can recover your funds Validators get paid in two ways  one  with a percentage of the overall stake rewards earned by the validator  and two  with block rewards  which they get for being the leader and successfully submitting a block  thus earning rewards for every transaction in the block  Right now stake rewards are by far the most dominant form of reward So yes  Validators need your staked coins  because they get a share of the staking rewards  that share being set by their commission level   and also because higher stake means getting more leader blocks which means an opportunity to earn more of the block rewards To be honest I m quite new to sollet so couldn t be too sure what s happenedI ve also just been told by someone else that you can t send usdc from sollet to binanceIf I sent it to an erc20 and not spl wallet does that mean the funds are lost  Is there any chance of recovery Are you sure it was erc20  Only asking because I don t think sollet supports erc20  at least not in the traditional sense  You re about to swap erc20 to slp but don t think you re able to  store  it there  I may be wrong as I have only done the erc20   gt  spl on sollet and not the other way around  If i were to guess  you had usdc spl and sent it to a wallet that supports erc20 and not spl It was Erc20 and was sent to my binance USDC wallet I have been buying from  moonpay  https   www moonpay com    and send directly to my wallet moonpay is listed on Solana s ecosystem page   https   solana com ecosystem  https   solana com ecosystem Was USDC erc20 or SPL token  And does the wallet you send it too support SPL token Very similar  However  it has the most decentralized platform of the rest  Personally  I think defi is great  but I prefer speed and reliability  SOL and Algo have more institution friendly platforms I am not living in U S A  but I have read lots of negative reviews for Binance US even though I use Binance myself here in Europe and it has been nothing but good so far  But as I have been told they are completely different entities  So do thorough research before choosing your exchange This sort of prediction is exactly why we need something like the COPE scores   leaderboards so we can determine whose opinions are actually worth listening to  as backed by historical data From what I ve seen of most crypto youtubers  many of them love to just make outrageous claims about coin X or token Y and put these huge numbers in the video thumbnails so people will click on them Anyone can make predictions  it s much harder to make accurate predictions I think SOL has a bright future  but that doesn t mean I have any basis for guessing a specific number it could rise or fall to in the future I use the crypto com app  Only because I use it for Ethereum so just made sense How does avalanche compare with both It averages about 10 5   they claim  I haven t been staking long enough to see a return yet though FTX is the best option imo Binance  FTX  crypto com Same here My crypto portfolio is basically 50 50 between SOL and ALGO  They both seem to have solid underlying tech  although I ve dived deeper into solana personally  and it s really just a question of adoption imo Thank you  Great help One thing that differentiates them as far as I can tell is the academic pedigree of having Silvio Micali at the helm of algorand  Both rely on an entirely new concensus algo but whereas algorand  the algorithm that is the namesake of the network  originated in a peer reviewed paper by Silvio himself written now over three years ago  PoH and the other innovations in Solana are much newer and  to my knowledge  correct me if I ve missed it  haven t been deeply vetted by an academic community  I think the public perception among potential adopters then will be that Solana promises higher throughput on layer 1 but possibly with more risk and unknowns  You will see more legacy institutions gravitate to something like algorand  see the copyright management deal in italy  and more VC tech investing in Solana for applications that benefit from the high performance without L2 complexities  see Serum for instance  possibly some gaming applications   So I wouldn t think of this as an either or   they re optimized for different use cases and both look very strong from where I m sitting  Anyone engaging in blockchain maximalism in 2021 is  I think  living in the past Other comments on this   Crux of an older thread is that algorand has inferior TPS   like every other chain I believe in both gt Is staking Solana safe   gt

and you wait patently to buy more on the right occasion The coin has been recently added on crypto com  the exchange I use  so I made some research on the coin and decided to buy a small amount to

weekend Phantom wallet    coming soon will replace all this Can you share that explorer link here I feel like making crypto currency s is one of the most difficult things in the world to make  made by some of the most brilliant minds    yet they leave this part out of the equation No amount of shitposting could turn Solana into a memecoin  Do it for the lols Pretty unbelievable but it doesn t account for the fee  You have to send  000005 less then you have  That is 5 zeros Apparently  I tried it 30x s and then I did slightly less than max and it worked 3x s in a row was sitting around

these rules because they are just putting your SOL in 3rd party validators  I think most will tell you who they are partnering with  Sometimes  it is better to cut out the middle man and stake directly with a validator  A quick google search of  Solana validators  will give you the list  Also  doing it this way is better because you will probably make more in interest  and if you choose a

aren t even available on exchanges I m perfectly capable of using my brain Kik was used as an example  kin in reality is geared towards devs in general https   explorer solana com    by looking into solana explorer and TPS history  I see upto 2500 TPS sometimes and mostly under 1000  It can as well be due to not enough transactions happening in the newtork been buying weekly but i grabbed more during this weeks dip Look at the tps number as reported in real time The masses definitely care about wallets  And you didn t answer my question That s how I understand it  yes See also the article from Binance  https   academy binance com en articles impermanent loss explainedMath is sometimes different as not each AMM uses this equation  e g  Uniswap V3 will make it more complicated as not all provided liquidity will be spread out from 0 infinity  but Uniswap V2 as well as Solana s Serum and Raydium use the plain x y k equation  short is XYK if you want to look up more info about the math  Also  keep in mind  the loss also exists symmetrically if one side tanks Also  I know you didn t ask that but the reward is automatically added to your stake amount so don t panic if you don t see transactions  that s normal Can I also get that link  please The masses don t care about wallets or exchanges with x  y k  are you saying that  in your example  10 BTC     500k  USDC    5 000 000  and this 5 million is a constant  So to be accurate  if BTC moons indeed to 150K  this means that  where x is in BTC  and y is USDC   x  150k y  x  y 5m     gt  x   5 77BTC     gt  y   865500     The total of the pool would be at   1 7m actually  but I think I got the idea  thanks thank you  this was extremely helpful Ok let me put it differently  there s no blockclain that is as fast AND

Solana only 1000 tps in reality  What makes you think that 50k tps what Solana is claiming is not true Thanks  I don t have a hardware wallet  yet  and I made a Solflare wallet by generating a keystore file Is there anyway to automate the log in process such that I don t need to re upload the file each time I want to access it   Its obviously not a game changer  but figured I would ask

you gotta have around 90  in your ownership  And even then   what s the point  just imagine you are the owner of 51  hs rate  Would you do anything  Nope  You would keep on riding the ride Why in coinmarketcap there is no data about solana max supply  Please let s know Sure I get that it s a balance of factors but isn t one of the biggest appeals of block chain that it gets rid of the middleman by distributing consensus across the network  If you re operating a network with a relatively small number of validators then you still have a small number of gatekeepers like with traditional payment systems so where s the appeal I don t know  I stop thinking about projects that are obviously vapor ware 1000mbps isnt enough  getting fiber via ATT    seems ok I think Near Protocol are claiming 100 000 tps   I have no idea what it is in reality though It s done a x10 since it s listed and it s pretty much still going strong without any real dips  these guys are actually really pushing for it to be a real thing Okay but how can they claim they solved the scalability trilemma when its a  touch of decentralization   Isnt that a broad claim for this state of the network

through them  I can get more capital to invest in projects more based on logic Agreed  nugget news is the bomb though What s the decent buy zone Who would take advice from bitboy  Guy just out to make money and gather a bigger following  Please do your own research rather than listen to that clown That being said   SOL looking bullish Non cardano related  xD is totally cardano related  cardano is build based on all that research  IOHK is Cardano Cardano development might be slower although they are in the top 3 of blockchain projects with more activity on github because they don t rush features and when they release something is usually top tech Look at the staking and delegating this feature is in many chains but cardano is probably the best  fully decentralized   you can delegate or undelegate at any time  no penalties  instant availability of the delegated coins    I haven t seen yet any alternative all the others have minimum commitment periods  money locked or freeze  penalties  etc Let see what happens when smart contracts arrive in a couple of months and then once they focus on speed i think real tps as per solana explorer is 980 TPS   not 50000  But still its a big deal as no other blockchain come even close and  the block confirmation time of 0 5sec  the closest others are Fantom and harmony  The solfare wallet is a bit shitty though  and I faced some issues while staking  especially sometimes transaction fail in the middle and have to resend etc  The wallet experience has been poor so far for solana I believe that Solana will be the Best solution for Web 3 0 Binance is garbage  FTX ftw Ha    you conveniently left out Algorand in ur comparison  Solana is a great project but still is not as decentralized imo to handle world economy  If it were to be truly decentralized  thus more secure  to handle the world economy  delegating power to specific validators is not the answer  Right now the crypto space is a fairly small market so delegated PoS still works fine but I think it will be a problem if it were to handle the world economy Every token needs to have a same amount of voting power and that is the true decentralization  Solana can massively scale but not as decentralized secure as you think Seems like step 1 would be to get coinbase to even list Solana itself first This is such a useless response Guys  is it good time to invest in Solana or its already too high price  Shall I wait for a dip and how much quantity will be good enough Thanks What do you mean with verify it by yourself So is Solana more decentralized than Cardano So is Solana more decentralized than Cardano So is Solana more decentralized than Cardano But I see serum there    SRM I should have been specific  I am unfamiliar with Sol  but I ve spent a lot of time researching Chia  debating whether I want to  mine  it actually   I just haven t spent a lot of time on the technical details  because frankly unless you re planning to hold long term  1 yr   or simply enjoy arcane details it s irrelevant from a trading perspective imo  There are only two projects I d blindly hold LT  BTC and ETH 1  It s already a meme2  The team is solid and the tech novel3  It s already a meme That s  really good advise u know why   It is really good discipline what is the most important so I don t  take into account ur pop up comment in cinical way just thanks for immersed advice There are 102 https   iohk io en research library Thank u for really good advise I am completely in an another field and sometimes it is difficult to have perfect schedule for everything and resist discipline Dude  Solana is a done deal  The technology is so much superior and it works  It is already the biggest alternative Usdt and USDC platform  look around where else are they  I don t think you understand what s really going on here  From know on its only a matter of time that it becomes the  1 project I started using Ascendex lately for simple trades and cross transfers  not only SOL is available it also allows SPL Usdc and Usdt deposits and withdrawals  I find the UI more user friendly compared to FTX Why do you think Solana is a top ten project So then if only enterprise level people can run a validator how does Solana avoid centralization Eos bragged about its TPS but DPOS just led to validator cartels Can you help me understand how Solana is different  Is the PoH aspect of the tech the differentiator Solflare is on chain use them  Fuck exodus its just cash grab company You have to have a fuck ton of sol to make it worth it dude Check this link   https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs  https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs You can always check  Solana Discord  https   discord com invite pquxPsq   it will be so much help for you as a Valdiator Notional value yea im getting the bandwidth installed saturday     computer is next step i figured You need the bandwidth first FTX did 1 22 billion  Coinbase pro did 3 6 billion  what are you talking about FTX did 10 8 billion dollars in volume over the last 24 hours and coinbase pro did 3 2billion what was your point again Kin is coming    I don t have intentions to sell     P Gate io or FTX are probably most popular places  Ya KIN had to move to solana because nothing else could handle the amount of transactions they are doing And where can you view and get these tokens  I m curious because I just looked up KIN and it used to be an ERC20 token  Seeing how fast Solana is  it s interesting to see all the projects using SPL and or thinking of moving over to Solana KIN Ok Excited to this I found this comment fair funnier than you probably thought it was These kin people come out the gutter everywhere to shill their bags from 4 years ago I saw that as well  I like Charles but I chose Solana because I always have a worrisome feeling with charismatic personalities and money  The way I see it  the Solana team acts  they don t talk or try to hype up things based on possible future business deals    On the other hand though  I have over 36k subs on youtube and wouldn t mind helping spread the word if there was some proper incentive Keep holding that bag man  I m sure it goes to ath soon Dude he asks about sol and you just start flapping about kin Please speak respectfully Read this thread on this subhttps   www reddit com r solana comments n0hyad a_summary_of_solana_the_tech_and_why_it_is_the  utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf Bitboy is literally the worst thing to happen to crypto He asked about sol you fucking moron Seems that being the target of a smear campaign has such effect on easily impress minds  gladly a fine U S  federal judge doesn t agree with you The options actually cause the most damage to people if the price is 54k That means following your logic today is the dip  not tomorrow  i e the 52  dip we saw earlier was the one you were looking for I read at least one Cardano whitepaper   I was not impressed Tarnished reputation  Once a scam  always a scam On the contrary  kin is the one of the most if not the most used token in the sol  ecosystem Nobody cares about kin except kin bag holders It s not a pump and dump I mean it s good for our bags if other exchanges add support  but really I m over all the exchanges and much prefer the serum dex using bonfida Could call it a BFT   Big Fat Target  as well gt Stop trying to apply logical to an irrational market  Solana will continue up because it s new and fancy  That s all that matters I understand the market and when they realize it s a pump  dump ppl will freak out Thanks Zan Kin never did it for me tbh Good too see you researching  sometimes it comes down to a gut feel  no one can tell you exactly what is right When you are unsure  like the majority of us  and you like 2 or 3 coins  then invest in all of them But keep monitoring and researching  as you learn more  you the might become confident enough to go all in on one  and sell off the others All depends how successful the project is and how hot the whole market gets Huh  guess no news is good news in this case Sorry to hear about the screenshot blocker  though you re right there s probably not much else to glean I poked around the Binance US mobile app and saw an  Open Orders  tab  maybe there s a button to cancel wallet transactions there  Can t seem to get far because I m not a verified user yet USDC everyone would like   SRM is pretty popular  but not sure it is essential   ERC20 tokens that are bridged over to solana might be depositable as SPL  not expert to know for sure Solved  I converted to SRM on raydium in case anyone finds this in the future Finding low cap alts in the USA is tough without having to spend gas for swaps Fuck that guy exodus io 50 look forward Sure thing I ll pm it shortly  As I said to Sam  feel free to google it before opening my link   don t just trust random links being sent to you The truth is  nobody knows  Bitboy and other  cripto influencers  are YouTube cancer  Solana doesn t need chilling to get to the obvious answer that the project is good Nobody cares  DOGE coin is the best performer this year  Stop trying to apply logical to an irrational market  Solana will continue up because it s new and fancy  That s all that matters Thanks for explaining  So what are the top SPL token projects out there that you d like to see listed Yes  Binance has SOL  but it does not support any of the tokens that use the SOL blockchain  There is a difference hey dude could i get that site as well please I think It is a project with great potential  but never put your eggs in one basket  I also own cardano  More solana through The speed  I don t believe a blockchain can be adopted with high fees and not able to do thousand of transactions a second  Solana is doing a great job  look how many people there are in the world  If 20  uses a blockchain  how many transactions a second will this be I chipped in today but the price wasn t like crazy good so just a couple hundred Binance has it aren t they the biggest exchange Seems reasonable looking at what things like Cardano are worth atm with no product I was more thinking of a 250  but 500 sounds better No need to point it out  ️ Shows up on chrome  also on firefox Scam

these technologies  do they The rewards automatically go to your staking wallet Thanks for the feedback   Tons of work left to do  especially at the app explorer ux level Good summary  All of them are getting better over time Jan feb march 22  4 year bitcoin cycle is up eoyUnless you think sol will go up significantly between now and Oct  Nov  Is a good chance it will double  but crypto is so unpredictable Thanks for the explanation  u cjwill2017 I have an active stake of SOL using solflare for over 5 days now  Where do I get to see the rewards for my stake I have been watching sol s perpetual chart for weeks    I determine the best buy zone and I buy gradually  My long orders increase as price goes down  Sometimes some of my orders aren t filled  But i always long some  So I don t t buy just dips I m able to buy on Binance us  Is this just a WA problem   Some state regulation   If so  maybe invest in a VPN to get around your op address Can you tell me more about how you do this   I sell peaks and buy dips with other cryptos  but SOL doesn t seem to have that many dips so I just hodl and invest in liquidity pools Your post has been automatically removed because your

solana  if you have any questions or concerns only reason i personally put ada  amp  dot down is bc those are actual ghost chains with no significant applications on them  sol  gt  ada  amp  rune  gt  dot Yeah  I checked  and it appears to show that the sol was taken from my wallet but doesn t appear that the usdc was with drawn from whatever wallet it was coming from  My sol wallet shows  number out and  number into another address  for usdc there is no number there at all  It s been like 2 hours  I m also getting error messages when I connect to serum now Looks like it s already peaked Uniswap is not an option  I use stealthex io  no kyc and no limits on the swaps Moonlet allows staking with no way to trade it  Hard to lose there Did you check out the solana explorer  What s it say there It s mostly paid for by inflation at the moment   Inflation started earlier this year at 8  and will reduce little by little every year until it is 1 5    The additional Solana produced by this inflation is distributed to validators  the nodes that actually run the network  as stake rewards  which are then paid mostly to stakers  but validators keep a fraction   their commission  typically 5    10  Additionally  validators earn rewards from emitting valid blocks during their leader slots  they get a fraction of each transaction fee paid in the block   At this time  this is a small quantity compared to staking rewards   But if when Solana has 30x the transactions  the transaction fees will then be 30x and this will make up a much more significant share of validator revenue   Eventually  when inflation is at 1 5  in some years from now  one would expect the majority of validator fees to be from transactions Great  a Co Founder    I have a question   Is the Solana network payed for by network fees alone   With transaction costs so low  how is it sustainable  How can stake holders and miners get high rewards with such little money coming in   Also  thank you for your contribution   Sol is my favorite currency Can you help out here  How can I buy in Washington state  US  Binance us does not allow from here  Please let me know some options  Thanks Nerve is launching

those It sucks that people base the success of something on how active the reddit is  Really hope for a bright future for Solana Solana seems to be known for its impressive 50k TPS  though Algriand will have 46k TPS this year which is pretty fast as well https   www algorand com resources blog algorand 2021 performance Wow man  i salute you for this commitment  Bravo  Glad we have you here among the SolFam Thank you for passing by Raj  this Solana Sub ReddIt is getting big  amp  active  the Solana community is amazing  they are helping each other with the knowledge they have so far about Solana  That s the real meaning of being a faithful community I m so grateful that it s all done organically  people are getting into Solana because they know how valuable it is in pushing the whole blockchain industry Thank YOU for your hard work   hats off No problem  Its the main wallet I use when Im not using exchanges  You can sync the mobile app to the desktop app fairly easily with a QR code too Sweet  I ll have to check it out  Thanks Not trying to shill  but what you think about Ankr   I already have SOL and Algo Ftx  U can also find the projects work with sol on ftx Here s to hoping for a brighter future with your product What platform do you use Just started on a project that uses Solana and Serum  Seems solid so far  Nice work Ftx us is pretty awesome Ah ok  Exodus is a good wallet  they do have an exchange feature built into it tho  Can stake a few different cryptos in it as well Thank you for stopping by Raj  Love the project and have 60 SOL  Dollar cost averaging my way on a mothly basis  SOL is on to big things and will shake up the current status quo  Cant wait for SolStarter to go live I m looking into wallets so I CAN T trade easily  the exchanges make it too easy to lose money I stake in exodus  The person who lost their funds probably sent to the wrong address or something  Exodus also gives you your private keys and has both a desktop and mobile app  I recommend it  Just dont use their exchange  fees are too high Excellent synopsis Cool thanks for that  I will check it out Thank you SOLANA Wow very cool to drop in of you   Just heard about Solana  and been learning and researching and like the project   haven t picked any up yet    Will when I get some funds I open long short positions everyday just to buy more sol  I have started with 30 sol from 9  and made it 160 sol but had to sell at 35  to help my brother  I started with 5 sol again 4 days ago and I have 15 sol now  My only focus on Sol right now  I ve never been this attached to such project before  I just want to say keep up the good work  Hard work is what keeps the ship moving I dont know about atomic  if you have it then search for Solana in the wallet I use exodus  it has Solana  and you can stake it there as well Hey Raj  Following the project since the white paper Yeah FTX  Binance  OKEx  just to name a few Good to see you here  I have been supporting your project for 2 months and invested with all the savings I have  I hope we all come to very good places one day Halim Proud owner of 20 SOL here Don t worry  this community will keep on growing  because the project is very solid  Keep up the good work cheers Would you or anyone on this thread who is commenting with confidence be willing to have a short discord call with me  I have questions about solana  flow  polkadot  cosmos  eth  avax and ftm and I m getting a bit overwhelmed with the videos that are too technical for my understanding    ‍ ️  ‍ ️ do you expect bears now  or still going The thing is all 800 validators are controlled by Solana  They have to go through KYC and because there s no slashing mechanism  Solana enforces good behavior exclusively by leveraging their central authority Solana  can t  be truly decentralized until slashing is implemented  Otherwise  it s kinda like thinking Google is decentralized because they have more than 1 server So Solana s centralization is real  at least for now They would be stupid to do so before SOL at very least surpasses ETH and frankly doubles eth market cap I like sollet io for kin  tried and true  but if you go to the phantom app website and join the discord the phantom wallet beta is crazy cool  but I d hold in sollet your main bag until the beta is over in case there is any bugs  If you have a ledger you can also use solflare ledger to hold kin and sol Sol Im going to take a look after work today  also do you know the best wallet to use for this and or the best mobile wallet  thanks Sweet  the sub is r kinfoundation and the site is kin orgThanks for taking the time to reply  there was a thread just the other day saying how we should be donating with kin like some of the other coins are doing and I thought of that when I read this  if you make a post about it I am sure you will get a lot of support It ll be probably double that by years end 100Billion to 350Billion marketcap this bull run minimum  You do the math on what it will be  If you missed out on ETH in 2017 you don t wanna miss this then I live in the US and am in the worst place to buy    NYC  I have some that a friend bought for me but trying to see where else I could buy exchange Let us know if you used the     Swap    Feature or the     Exchange     If you used the     Exchange     scroll down the page  amp  see if there is any     Open Orders      If nothing there check the     Recent Transaction History      amp  update in here so we can help you further FINALLY  ENTIRE LAST WEEK WAS HELL   tears of joy Thank you for making such a cool product  I ve been wanting to invest for a while but as a New York State resident have been unable to find a platform that will allow me to do so  Any suggestions  Best of luck The reward is automatically deposited into your wallet for solana She just keeps rising  I m calling 227  price point by my birthday next year  2 27  Someone save this post to either celebrate with me or roast me I ll be anticipating both with champagne and So   Lana Del Rey will make an appearance There is no WhitePaper yet according to their website  amp  their official Social Media Accounts  https   solstarter org  https   solstarter org What is TCAAB can you link me to the subreddit if there is one  I d like to learn about it  and yes i m 100  willing to add it Lump sum the bull  DCA the bear Yes Amazing  thanks so much for your thorough reply and support  this is so helpful  I thought I was losing my mind but this clears a lot of stuff up  ️ I ll contact binance support on Monday   Tuesday  whenever support will be open  and see what I can do  I ll update in the replies if I get it sortedThanks again I ll keep buying until ETH 2 0 arrives  Then I will reassess my portfolio Huh  My post literally says they don t do a great job with showing us upcoming projects Also  they don t label who are the top SOL holders with their rich list which worries some people as well    It s a known fact that Solana ticks every single box as far as tech and fundamentals go but they just aren t great with being completely transparent which is why many people out there are holding off investing I ve bought Sol but I ve new to staking  so I ve been using them to swap and see how staking works it  Definitely buying even more Sol soon Get on the train before  50  This may

for Solana  Aside that  nothing Watch CoinBureau recent video  Not knocking Sol at all I m hodling Ask him if you can create a  police report first Just bought 40 Solano at the top  don t even care  I don t have time for eth 2 0 to come out  Just like verruca salt   I want it NOW Picked up my first 2 SOL  not much I know  but pretty happy with it   Been added to my monthly pickups source Now why did i sell my 20 sol i bought for 3  a Piece     Sold them at 13 so i cant complain Unfortunately  one small thing Solana isn t great with is project transparency  I don t believe there is a solid roadmap yet I think you are miss understanding some things    That happened in the very early stages  Solana is considered one of the MOST decentralised blockchains we have to date with roughly 800 validator nodes   that is most certainly decentralised     I mean just look at bitcoin  china gets a blackout and the market crashes because 40  of the PoW hashrate comes from China    So nothing is perfect and Solana is still only just coming out They didn t pump billions in  they invested early and with limited downside clauses  And it s only worth billions because  80  of the float is owned by insiders  As soon as they start to look for liquidity in fact this is already fixed  you also have a mobile app Bear market better come soon I have money waiting to drop into this beauty this is a issue who will be fixed soon    normally so don t use the leverage   pretty simples   If you think its rigged then don t use it I m guessing 65usd by the end of may You can get up to 14  on binnacle and around 10  on FTX if your happy to have your coins on an exchange There are a lot of scam sites too  I got caught by one I m ashamed to say Bought at  2  not enough at the time  only  2k by transferring some of my BTC and ETH in it from my 2018 holdings  Bought at  8 an ok amount with fiat this time  still not enough    But that s just greed  I think I did well here Bought 3 days ago at  43 with fiatWill buy again on the next consolidation level  again with fiat   hopefully this will be when it will reach number 10 by market capLooking to sell an amount of other coins in the near future into fiat to get my initial investment back and let Solana rip to the moon TCAAB Lol This week idk  Bit it will hit  100 in May  You heard it here first TCAAB Alameda just brought another  3 Billion worth of SOL   could be another big partnership coming yeah solana is the future expect solana to surpass bitcoin and ethureum in market cap Not sure if you re just a troll but no  no idea where you heard that  One of the biggest since the beginning has been Alameda Research investments who to date owns just under  13 Billion  They have been heavily invested since the start and also pump money into the entire Solana eco system like Serum  FRONT  amp  REN just to name a few If you re asking would like just all of a sudden sell and destroy the market    no that s not how these investment firms work lol  They HEAVILY believe in Solana hence why they have pumped billions into them  If anything you should follow what these guys do Where did you hear this I m also staking Solana on exodus  it has been more than one week today but I still didn t receive any reward  Is it normal 2 5 times Bitcoin right now   no reason to think Bitcoin couldn t go 10 fold in 5 years I

very weird situation With such an awesome project that totally overshadows BSC   ETH it will moon alot further  4 5 digit is not a problem for Solana       https   emojikeyboard org copy Rocket_Emoji_

  Or really anything other than the current price We can t time the market   sauce yourself and double down goes both ways   ill post again when the market tanks because of exchange bot liquidations A week How long before we reach  100 Ok  i will leave you to live in the fanboy world Could you add Kin  I know our community would really promote this as well  It s a SPL token  and a really good project    Kin is one the best ways to show what Solana is capable of   Anatoly Yakovenko of the Solana Foundation told CoinDesk We would really appreciate it and I KNOW there would be a lot of donations Not that tech savvy for it  still wallet support is well needed for me   I will find some way  cheers lol clearly and now someone is salty I believe it is every epoch but we have to go through a 1 epoch waiting phase and the next epoch after is when our rewards get distributed its an observation over many months   Most of the buying is not real   Its shorts being liquidated at tops and then it drives prices higher sucking in starry eyed moon boys Same when the market tanks   Its mostly buyers being liquidated It pisses me off that the exchanges get away with it time and time again There should be more public campaigns to not trade on any leverage and put these casinos out of business I ve been converting other coins  But as for fiat purchases  I m done with those until the next bear market I m not going to bother trying  honestly   If you wanted to be informed  there are plenty of ways to educate yourself Hi sorry I missed your other post I m sorry to have to say that I don t know much about wallets   I m a command line guy and do all my stuff through the command line  which is not the most convenient way to do things  but it is the most powerful   As a result  I ve never used Phantom or Solflare  so unfortunately I can t give you any advice about them I am actually working on my own staking front end  but I don t know when it will be done  so don t hold your breath waiting for it This Projects insanely undervalued   anything sub  500 is cheap imo  Bought more today  extremely bullish I ve been buying every week Bought another stack 2 days ago here we go   where do y all come from  derp it went up derp derp The network went down for 6 hours The problem with Algorand is they use language with garbage collection  Go   This will be always slower than language without garbage collection  Rust I hate myself for getting out in late Feb  I was  still am  a crypto noob and didn t know anything about Solana as a whole at the time Your post has been

two active projects It s not true  Validators vote on each block  That s why there are so many transactions per block I agree on maximalism but I see academic maximalism in your comment Hey Z   glad that you replied  actually I already asked you in some other post if you can share your validator name  but I guess you didn t saw it   I believe a lot of us here on reddit learned a lot from you  so definitely I would like to thank you with delegating some of my SOL   And really great that you pointed out some others validators  will diversify on them as well   Btw  I m currently using phantom wallet and not sure how to delegate my sol to you  when I m trying through Solana beach I can only use SolFlare wallet  Do you know is there any option build for Phantom or I need to make a SolFlare wallet The only POW I m interested in is btc and eth personally Oh I thought of one more  Arweave filecoin because you mine it by storing data for the network Did you short sol or something  Show us your position There is no space on the last word bro  it s driving me crazy  can t figure out why Make sure there isn t a space on the last word  Obligatory reminder not to share your seed phrase with anybody Thank you for the answer I agree  I think any price atm is cheap in the long term  Go for it Honestly I think the dip is over I will be but not today  will wait until 44 8 It might go back down  I feel like I missed the dip tho but either way I think it will eventually go way up over time so its still a good time to buy It s up 8 5  today  you don t think it ll go back down Ill be buying some more today Thank you  Community shows strong support    I love that Happy to see  SOLANA didn t get any effect by BTC I got SOL  amp   SRM  and  I hope  SRM will   follow the same Your

 APY Has anybody had any luck with this  I can t get into my wallet either JAI SHREE RAM Given where the macro market is  I would say probably at LEAST  100 by next Sunday Should still be in this range Go To    Serum Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6   Sollet Section  or    Serum Telegram    https   t me ProjectSerum   ask about the problem there  amp  they ll help you out  they are the ones responsible for that Bridge You don t have to pay anyone  500  watch out for scammers after you said that SolanaSummer Bruh  why don t you use the same address you use for SOL to hold your RAY  As a matter of fact  why don t you use your SOL wallet to keep all of your Solana tokens For example  you can use your SOL address to send all kinds of tokens without worrying if you have sent them to the correct address or not  SOL puts them in the right  bucket  for you Contact support from where you sent it from  They might be able to recover it Binance us Yeah something like that  I think it ll fluctuate between a dollar or 2 for awhile then move up in price So approx      5  of  43 It s possible  I like the optimism Double Binance us Probably the same  maybe a dollar or two more or less Have you tried contacting the support for Sollet  They should be able to retrieve them for you if theyre stuck Where can we see upcoming Solana based projects It has been like that since they announced sos was a thing  Hard to get excited about an erc20 token for sol projects The Trevor Lawrence news I wonder Exodus will not allow solana exchanges  it s been locked up for like 3 days Question  i see Luna advertised on Exodus  but it doesn t seem to be supported on the app   Is this only for the desktop version Me DCA every month along with BTC Love the project and looking forward to a bright future with SOL I don t care about the ATH   I bought more today   There will be a new ATH soon Thank you Praise the Sun Currently mining fiat at my job to transfer to solana Yeah heard a lot of great stuff about it  Is it true top whales in Sol all know each other and could manipulate if they d want Correction  the most current dip is over  The next one will be higher SOL is long term for me  just like BTC or ETH for instance No idea what you mean by      I wrapped my wFTM into a SPL wFTM     Your Transaction went through the Ethereum blockchain  confirmed there   Go To    Serum

that Bridge  gt  This recoverable  Yes  no need to worry about that  they ll have to confirm it s your transaction  amp  you ll get your wFTM I can t see any bears How so  I thought he was honest about it Will you be hodling SOL through bear market Try a different browser maybe I m not surprised lol I like how this coin keeps out shining everybody again and again    i bought in at  7 I had a good feeling about this project and still do It s a very good and honest review  It confirms that SOL isn  as we know   a centralized chain promoting decentralization  And a blockchain going offline for 6 hours is the purest sign for this  A decentralized blockchain with enough validators would not suddenly go offline  I m invested in SOL  because I believe in the hype  but the don t believe in the tech  As we saw from the referenced YouTube video  even the answers of the SOLs creator are being cut out and censored SOL finally broke that resistance  New ATH ahead  family What s your current thoughts for May price movements when we see dip 20 30  i buy plenty Love you man  Thank you for bringing such a piece of tech to the table sollet io And still you are not able to revate  my points  cause those are facts There s always another dip Really   I m about to watch it in a few minutes If he s being honest though that really sucks  Edit  What are the sending fees for that like  Maybe he s gonna be like you didn t send it all and then ask for more   Peer to peer is sketchy  not to mention the amount of steps you normally need to go through before you can actually send it did you wap on raydium   and with wich wallet Youll end up making a profit anyways as long as you hodl Ikr  but my cash are not ready yet in bank account Too late you cant time the market You are wrong in almost every way and deserve one million downvotes I m always buying  It will hit top 5 imo Chart wouldn t look as good if he added Elrond Raj  I have been following since one of you guys went on Kevin Roses podcast over a year ago  Bought immediately after launch and held ever since  Now looking for ways to contribute It is too early for me to see lacking on chain governance as an issue  I want to see how well it works before considering lacking it a fault  It definitely could be but I think the chain is too young for on chain governance to be a positive at this stage If I were you  this isn t financial advice btw  but I would buy now and stake it it or you could put some stink bids at  40 5 42 Why d you leave out Elrond Probably not for me today        I ve been buying a little bit every day during the dip I am not well versed enough on the tech to evaluate that  If it is true though  and manipulateable as it sounds  then it will be very hard for them to implement automated slashing and they may be stuck on manual slashing for a long time this article is gold Sounds like a pretty negative review If there is nothing there to settle my guess is you placed a limit order  your price wasn t hit and you have an open order  You will need to cancel the open order Great news  Love what you re doing  keep it up so i guess we re close to a top then When a doubter comes in here spreading FUD you need to convince them to have two coffees and a beer  then think it over again  TCAAB should do as long as you re using the same wallet   I would look for their discord servers for further help as out of ideas now It didn t work unfortunately Will that work even if I did the conversion on serum not raydium https   dex raydium io   market 9wFFyRfZBsuAha4YcuxcXLKwMxJR43S7fPfQLusDBzvT  https   dex raydium io   market 9wFFyRfZBsuAha4YcuxcXLKwMxJR43S7fPfQLusDBzvT  go here  connect your wallet Or just go directly to the trading tab in Raydium  not trying to scam you with that link here  Once connected near bottom left you will see  unsettled balance  see if anything shoes there  if it does click  settle Yea well if I can t move it out  it s not gonna do me any good NoC how do I do that have you checked the trading tab for unsettled funds Mid fifties Hey u digitalinstincs  thanks for dropping in  it s refreshing to see anyone actually from a team on reddit  let alone a founder  Much appreciated  I m wondering if you could point me in the right direction  Coming from the Ethereum investing side of things  what would be the best way to start learning about Solana and some projects built on your chain  It s pretty overwhelming  and while I m sure I just need to spend more time digging  I m finding most of the guides directing people to FTX to buy  SOL  And being from NY  I don t have access to FTX or any exchange that has a market for SOL tokens  Is there a bridge or some way to move ETH over and then swap that for SOL and any Solana chain tokens ‍ ️ Absolutely unreal  Very few people knew about solana a few months ago  now its in USA today  This is just the beginning   there is so much more to come from the solana team thank you Please don t moon it yet  though it look like  i need 4 more day to throw     k in this Yeah everything is working alright but just no token name and symbol in sollet I staked on Exodus  too   It s super simple to do   Return is currently 10 57  https   support exodus com article 1551 solana staking faq I will try Exodus It is a bit intimidating the whole process for me but i ll try it The benefit is a 10  gain per year  I am not a trader  I want to invest and why not gain some free money from my investment what do you see as the main benefits of staking it There was some issues due to server overload   but everything is working good now and yes have been to stake unstake  use the trading  liquidity tab so can t complain Short term movement is only noise  Invest for long term I think we might get stuck   USD50 for a couple weeks lol give half a story in the title     if it s in your wallet then yes ofc he s sent it to you I think we might get stuck   USD50 for a couple weeks Absolute BS  if its PM in a discord and you don t know them it s a scam I recently transacted with this person  so I sent him some sol  and received some other things in kind   so we know each other s addresses  Yes  I actually see the wbtc sitting in my wallet   I guess I could be involved in some laundering  but honestly  it s quite a small amount for that I staked all of my SOL on Exodus  it is easy and if I need it I can unstake it in 4 days Ask yourself  how does this person know they sent the money to you  how does a complete stranger know they sent it to you Edit  The money actually being there is weird though If I had more money I would have bought more Check kadena as hedge to pos  they use sharding but with pow consensus Plus as solana  is a non BFT replication library  It implicitly assumes that the leader is correct  It just does replication  and a faulty leader can put the system into an unrecoverable state I just received these messages from a stranger I recently transacted with I checked my wallet  and there was really some wbtc in it Could this be a scam  Will I be exposing myself to any vulnerabilities if I were to send this wbtc back to his address My amount in question is very small   lt 200usd Cost averaging is pro move Have unstaked it before  Any issues with it Solana  is a non BFT replication library  It implicitly assumes that the leader is correct  It just does replication  and a faulty leader can put the system into an unrecoverable state  Plus validator requierements are not very accesible https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs  also Solana makes 200 or so decisions per second  They batch 250 transactions or so  to get the decisions up to those numbers  This is the simplest trick in the book  some academics have built careers out of this batching trick  All projects should be reporting decisions per second  Solana has a lot of marketing I m sorry I m not too sure then    My checklist would be to make sure I have the correct amount of words  no spaces  spelling correct  If the problem persisted I would restart my computer and clear cache on new browser  I haven t had to deal with this issue  yet Just gonna put abit in each month I think You need to readup on this project some more  Read about clusters here    https   docs solana com cluster overview  https   docs solana com cluster overview The leader does not have as much power as you think I had that problem aswell  If you are trying to swap larger amounts then 0 1 eth I recommend stealthex io I m a firm believer in the project and I m a long time investor  I ve noticed that while other cryptos fluctuate  with big swings  this one keeps steadily going up I have similar when I add liquidity for STEP USDC  I am still able to add the LP token to the fusion pool though so doesn t appear to matter Thank you for helping make Solana what it is    I will do my best to spread factual info on this subreddit and make it a great community How about the fact that there is no on chain governance   Algo doesnt have it either  tbf You should be able to buy Bitcoin  then transfer it to a wallet like Exodus  then exchange it in the wallet   The only problem is that the fees are pretty high to do it this way   I did that a few days ago  and I just broke even now
2021-05-02,49.50080424,49.89667224,45.98182211,Lol yesssss it does   I made quite a few a few weeks ago and posted  not a lot of traction tho isnt it a good feeling to see your OC reposted  you have one of like    2 or 3 dozen total solana memes in existence Solana foundation should buy this and allow DApp developers to have a decentralized  solana domain name for their dapp  https   www namebase io domains solana  https   www namebase io domains solana Avalanche and Cardano are secure without slashing  Why is slashing necessary for Solana and not those others I bought a tiny tiny bit at 42 Waiting for it to hit 20s before I come in bit time Might take a few weeks for that to happen  Keeping my eye on it I can t do big buys when it s at ATH  Just too risky  Rather miss out on a bull run for a few weeks  I m too much of a scaredy cat I guess How can I stake it when I have my coin via a broker I have the same   I have entered 24 seed and I cannot get into the portfolio   Seeds are 100  correct  I have 3 places saved  the next button does not work Makes sense  Also for hackathon and to invest in some other Solana projects coming out this  And make sure you leave enough sol to complete the transaction Boys I m late to the party but at the same time it s just getting started  I m coming from the EOS world  which I still believe in  but Solana has so much potential let s fucking  go  Nothing crazy but I say 60 by 6 1 which is a great return even today still didnt work for me  It s simply saying transaction didn t work didnt short  I just recognize the patterns Too bad the platforms you buy them in sometimes have shady ratings  SOL needs to sell on Crypto  Com or Coinbase already Just another humble  yield  farmer gotcha   yea I m trying to figure out if it s worth setting up a node or not   If I can do that with a zero SOL starting balance and still earn at least 10 or more SOL per month  say with current price of    50  then I may be interested when you say break even  what is the monthly cost aside from electricity to run the node   I m actually paying a certain amount of SOL every month I tried reading articles on this but I just didn t get it  That s insane   how is that even a thing lol  Is it like a bet where you need to put a time limit on it or something  So much temptation in going full rookie and risking my whole family living on the streets to in turn make millions haha Thanks so much for your help man  your a legend What I lost it at the last second got me That would work well  theres lots of liquidity in the sol ray pool    Sooner or later  hopefully sooner   it will be built into the raydium protocol to  route  trades the automatically with the most efficiency possible No it wasn t lol  that was normal consolidation getting ready for a bump up in price   Usually when you see that sideways action on a solid project after multiple runups it just needs time to breathe while people pull profits Hey mate  Sorry no source article to post   I watch their trading portfolio very carefully and action my trades off what they do  Only reason I see movement like that Right okay  they made it sound like they only did futures  What are futures though Just check the pools page on raydium and make sure there is plenty of liquidity in the pool before you make a swap  Ray pairs have the most liquidity because they are incentivizing providing liquidity by offering high APR in the farms Just bought at all time high  Man  Feel like early 2018 all kver again And sadly another instance where US regulations are preventing its citizens from competing on a global playing field Gluck to everyone who s been or plans to participate in the Tour de Sol hey man  So ive created a sollet wallet and yeah radium looks like exactly what I want   also keen to buy OXY as well  I m a complete noob to DEX s though man   could you point me in the right direction  What is pools slippage  And how do I check the liquidity of these pools  I just want a small bag of both those tokens to start  maybe some Ray as well and im planning on swapping SOL as that s what I own https   ibb co qNTDMgM  https   ibb co qNTDMgM  https   ibb co Y8Ldw3Q  https

Good meme bro  get us some more  we  need more memes in Reddit I liked the Simba meme  D I like this one lol All in Solana  to the moon i have bought at 10 GBP and now its 35  shall i resell some and wait for drop or not yet FTX us is a good one   Low fees and really nice UI  You can use Coingecko to look up any coin and it will tell you all of the exchanges that coin is traded on and the pairing used  just for future reference Copy that  I just find it interesting that there would be another exact address just like mine with only the difference between one letter being A lowercase  I figured if they got sent to a invalid address It might come back but I guess not Why would you short any crypto asset in a bull market  And why would you short an asset that is approaching ath  again  To each their own I guess Is it possible to stake SOL using Trust Wallet  Thank you Unclear at the moment  But you would need at least  24k SOL to even begin validating  Otherwise  nobody would delegate any stake to you  Most validators put 24k up front and the foundation provided them with an extra  170k of their own to stake Didnt work  no one having this bug  Ray sol lp not accounting sol value on the LP pair That s my understanding as well  Slashing is a non trivial problem  and given the speed Solana  my guess it s especially hard in this case  Solana is extremely interesting and has tons of potential  I hope they manage to solve slashing soon you think in future Bitcoin will still at  1 trillion  no man  no As far as I understand it they simply haven t implemented it yet  I assume because the network is still so young  But yes  for now  your point stands https   github com agjell sol tutorials blob master solana validator faq md 11 how much stake is needed to be profitable and can future rewards be calculated Still  as long as they don t have a slashing protocol  Solana can t rely on economic incentives and game theoretical assumptions to keep the network secure  What keeps the network secure right now is the threat of slashing by central enforcement I would point out that you don t need to go through KYC to be a validator  That is only to participate in TdS since they hand out rewards It can take a few days sometimes for things to be caught up enough to withdraw stake from validators  After a new Epoch starts  check on  solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io   try a few times throughout the day and youll be able to withdraw Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this

competition  for Solana  but interoperability  blockchains working together  is a more common theology in the crypto community   With that being said  Solana founded the concept of Proof of History blockchains  this makes it unique to all the Ethereum clones out there that basically copied ethereum s code and made it proof of stake  If the issues with sharding arent figured out by the Ethereum team sooner than later  Solana will prove its scalability and be part of the ecosystem for the long term Use FTX then move funds to a wallet that YOU OWN like  Sollet io  https   Sollet io   or ideally a ledger instead of a hot wallet   Otherwise your crypto is not really yours  Start to learn to use blockchains instead of centralized exchanges  it will change your life I think I will unstake ans stake again  fees are low on solana right Solana isnt a Protocol   its a blockchain  it will never be a parachain  it will be a proof of history blockchain of its own   Glad to see you are trying to think about these things on a deeper level  but this concept doesn t really make sense Is been some days that is not working  All other LP and tokens are working  Only the Ray SOL LP token that has wrong balance of sol value  making so my total balance is less than supposed  I hope I think is a bug on the stepfinance interface  is in alpha so  But it made think I was losing money  and stil dont know if I am actually They will be pretty similar  One validator doesnt have advantages over another validator  but the fees they charge for staking in their pool may be different   If everyone staked their SOL on binance then Solana would be centralized like Binance Shit Chain and then it wouldnt be as secure or valuable  Staking with binance means you don t own your keys which defeats the whole purpose of  being your own bank      TLDRL     Learn how to use solflare Thanks al for your help  I returned it  As of now  nothing has happened to me  Perhaps it was really just an honest mistake FTX is legit   but do this on chain and you wont have these suspicions  get a sollet  or ledger   load it with Sol  make swaps on raydium or use  dex projectserum com  https   dex

that out there incase there was some browser extension or something and you had keys   In sum it wouldn t be an issue at all if you did this to a wallet that was up to date with spl support  And even for one that wasn t it would probably an easy fix if you had the passphrase  I hope support is kind to youGive FTX a try especially when interacting with SOL   spl How 10 Moonlet 11 62  now   And you can stake with Ledger wallet gt 	Still cheap under 500FTFY Man im sorry but you sent USDC from the solana blockchain to a USDC receiving address on the binance blockchain   Pretty sure thats gone  Take this as a lesson to be aware of the different blockchains and make sure you are sending to and from the same chain If you really cant figure it out    you can make a new wallet and move the funds over 1 2 3 Still cheap under 50 Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko was the first to conceive the concept of Proof of History  Fantom is another Proof of Stake blockchain  This unique concept is why I m so excited about Solana Ftx us if your in the us I want to emphasize this  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS Copy and paste receiving addresses Nice  Appreciate your comment  that s what I did  It seems like the most straight forward way if you have access to FTX Also things like these are fishy as hell   https   medium com solana labs solana foundation permanently removes 11 365m from token supply dd58c8db8d0d  https   medium com solana labs solana foundation permanently removes 11 365m from token supply dd58c8db8d0d   Why would they issue an enormous number of highly valuable asset  that people invested in  doing their calculations about investment  to some  market maker  and not even announce that sale   lending or sale  doesn t matter  what matters is the real money of retail investors  that such moves affect    I don t trust both Elrond and Solana long term  since both of them were spotted doing fishy stuff with distribution and fairness to investors and users  Look at Elrond top wallets   half of the supply is in hands of anonymous folks companies  Nobody knows what are they  Binance coinbase etc  are known wallets and are out of the question  but their wallets are just 2 out of 10 top holders  who the fk are other 8 giga whales of elrond  the community has no clue Interesting Solana review but where s the comparison part   D  How many other projects did you investigate and dive deeper into tech and ecosystem      It s all nice to be excited about some project  but Solana has huge questions for security and decentralization  along with fair distribution  same as Cardano has  PoS networks overall have all the same problem  when staking rewards will be less profitable than lending DeFi rewards of the same equivalent of    people will get off staking and put it all to lending  making the network less secure  It ll happen eventually to any PoS network  and I don t know how they ll deal with it  There are only 2 options  make high gas to pay the stakers  or make high inflation to pay the stakers  Both options are crappy solutions for the end user    Would be interesting so see your analysis of Kadena let s say  a PoW network that benchmarked 480k TPS which is more than both Elrond Solana Cardano combined  have you seen that Solana right now operating at 2000 TPS and not 50k TPS or anything like that  Cardano operates at around 1000 TPS   The PoW of Kadena can have 1000000  miners participating  while not taking a hit on TPS  because of the way blocks reference each other across the 20 chains  which will scale to more chains since they tested the mainnet scaling from 10 to 20 chains last year   And there s no need for masternodes and paying exorbitant gas fees to anyone  the gas fee is 0 0000000000576 KDA for a regular transaction right now   KDA is less than a dollar for now   Let s say KDA will be 100  or something  and the network congested as hell and causes x1000 rise in gas price  well it ll be only 0 0000000576 KDA   0 00000576    fee  in these worst case scenarios  And let s say your smart contract deployed is as badly optimized as Decentraland estate land management contracts   D  Well multiply the cost x1000 one more time and you get a fee of 0 00576  for interacting with worst lame coding contracts on the network  Decentraland fees in ETH that were displayed for people who try to do anything with their land estates are in thousands of dollars per transaction and we were laughing crying about it in discord  I m a district owner there  I can t fkn operate my district because of the fees  their tech is just so bad starting from contracts ending with 3D engine that blows up my Mac any time I browse the game even in empty lands That s what I thought when it was  36  now I m 6000 SOL poorer because I didn t buy in Thanks for your reply  ️ Oh  the third screenshot was just an example of the network s binance is expecting a deposit into USDC to come from  that s not what I used  yeah your totally right  I used a sol address into a spl usdc address by mistake  thanks for clearing that up   i was like one click away from the erc20 option    facepalm I did speak to a community manager of SOL over discord and he verified that my transaction was successful  Which is the more concerning part for me  So hopefully your right and the money does come back to my wallet eventually  but I think the it might just be stuck over at binance somewhere  I ll have to contact support at binance next week  since SOL has basically verified it s out of their hands  I ll let you know when I find out anything else  ️And I m not certain if binance uses a seed phrase  I ll have to check that out  I don t believe it does though   That s just my hope because I don t recall writing one down Nice  thanks for the answer man  Where is the best links to get more involved in the community Solana is no doubt one of the best chains out there  definitely the most efficient without sacrificing decentralization or security   If your protocol is written in Rust then yes I would highly recommend getting started on Solana  EVM coming soon but not yet a thing At least 1 just wait till you start using it to power protocols like Raydium io FTX does SPOT trading too Fuckint facts     as unsaid that I open myExodus and shits up 7 more   wtf if its a valid address  it is gone  check 8f the transaction was validated  always copy paste instead of typing addresses Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this

do you think it lacks marketing gt  I assume the answer is no Correct  you can t You can t send USDC    USDT that are not already SPL to your Solana Wallet In the other hand you may send USDT ERC20 via  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  through Metamask  WormHole Bridge  You may also send USDC to to your Solana Wallet via FTX since it supports the USDC SPL It seems to happen often from what I ve seen  but I don t use Exodus often either  That said  if I use it that infrequently and I see it pretty much every time  then I d say it prob happens often  You can check the list of assets  here  https   www exodus com status  assets  to see the current status of each coin I ve seen some occurrences of certain exchanges between coins not being available in Exodus but haven t experienced issues with sending receiving  Is it something you would say happens frequently or rarely gt   Is it possible to unstake and withdraw my sol through another wallet like for example Exodus  Yes you can  but to withdraw your Stake  you have to wait for the Current Epoch to finish You can check how long is an Epoch from here   https   solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io  The moment i wrote to you this

episodes after a week  I can t remember which episode it was but Anatoly started laughing when called an ETH killer    Basically said ETH has its purposes and is good for a lot of things  but Solana is great for a lot of different things  like trading stocks quick financial transactions millions more   I guess it ll depend on how strong ETH 2 0 is before these other  ETH killers   dot  ada  sol  etc  start getting niche developers jumping ship on ethereum You might want to ask these questions on the Bonfida discord https   discord gg BH5dxypV Is Solana really going to bright as we are expecting guys  there is a lot of competition between the different cryptocurrencies nowadays  In the future there will be even more competition so what is going to happen in few years when stuff like DOT will be even bigger Anyone have an idea of token release date  As well as tokenomics info None work  Raydium will only let me trade for Raydium  Orca and Bonfire doesn t work in US  SerumDEx uses SWAP which is down annd says to use Raydium No I spoke too soon  Will only exchange for Raydium   if I try to exchange for anything else says  insufficient liquidity  hmm Where do you find these

test net  Theoretically unlimited scaling potential with node hardware upgrades Awesome  thank you Yes brilliant  Works  Mucho gracias There is 8  inflation at the moment with Solana so 10  isn t all that  effectively it s 2   Struggling to get my head around proof of history but the transaction speed cost seems amazing  Guess the challenge is getting developers on board When you click USDT in your wallet make sure you re sending it Via ERC 20   unless the place you sending it to accepts it via SPL This image shows how Solana would be bring a whole new level of advancements to the world of blockchain  Solana is Revolution  I am in for the long term   Winter    Solana is coming So the link was to poly chain capital and they don t seem to hold SOL  But I checked Almaedas list and it looks like it just lists which assists they hold  but not details regarding how MUCH they hold  All the amounts listed there are just its market data  so the  13 billion number was likely just the total market cap Yea most those people don t actually lose it and just don t settle a transaction on a dex etc  and have to ask for help their first time   Either way it s not user friendly and needs to improve  People are onboarding onto serum quickly and sollet is the default  It s great that so many people are starting to want to use Serum but sollet simply isn t user friendly and will turn some off   I think this will be rectified soon I ll definitely check that out  Thanks for the knowledgeable response The same  Mining Fiat weekdays  Buying SOL in weekend I more meant that less people as a percentage were levered long and therefore did not get liquidated  Search for  cascading liquidatuons  The recent sharp sell offs in bitcoin are caused by leveraged traders getting liquidated which triggers more and more liquidatuons as the price drops  Still at some level there was strong demand for Solana  people were  waiting for a dip  and that weekend they realized they weren t getting a very big one and just bought    idk just guesses mostly    Several wise traders have told me to watch which coins recover fastest after a dip  this is insight to where future money will flow   In the previous couple dips prior to that one solana and doge  of all things  recovered quickest  As far as the staking  it doesn t hurt but plenty of other coins have similar levels of staking and didn t fare as well You need to study consensus mechanisms a bit more  If you think Cardano  EOS  Binance Chain  et al  solved  anything  that Ethereum hasn t  you re simply wrong In fact  it would be trivial for Ethereum  and probably for Solana as well  to take a DPoS consensus mechanism like ouroboros and stick it into the network  The problem is those systems  are not  great  And are terrible if you actually want to succeed in attracting businesses to build on your network Slashing means that an attack has a capital cost  failed attacks in all those DPoS networks are free  Finality is not ever truly guaranteed in those systems  and there are tons of other problems Solana is going to attempt to build a secure  decentralized  PoS system  with the possibility of delegating  and that s a bit of a weakness  not a strength  from a security and decentralization stand point Not even a competitor with ethereum     listen to the solana podcast and you might learn something about where the founders want to take this True  Just seems most people throw themselves into Sollet and end up screwing themselves over  I see at least 5 threads a day of people losing their money lol You can t connect Exodus to the serum dex  you can t participate in the agricultural revolution on Raydium with the Exodus wallet  Sollet has its issues  looks like Phantom will solve most of them   Just know that the people using sollet are trying to do things you simply cannot do on Exodus like trading on  dexs and yield farming Its ERC 20 Im pretty sure  The Solana network would be for sending Solana Yeah that totally makes sense  It just seems as though all graphs look the same as btc when it s otw down  I wouldn t think every coin is selling off at the same time  But     does make sense that less people are holding Solana  Its new  Everyone believes   Didn t sell  And held the price   I wonder if everyone staking it has anything to do with the price stability and consistent rise Everyone sold btc to buy Solana   jk  but btc had lots of liquidations driving tge price down  SOL had less  Anytime there is pent up demand for a coin it either dips less or recovers from the dip before other coins I think we see  100 before we see  30 again and I think it happens sometime in May  I remember how excited I was on Easter Sunday when it hit  25 Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns Probably drop till 28 30 and then shoot for ATH again So placing the order itself is a transaction on the solana explorer whether or not it gets filled  If your order got filled you just need to settle the transaction  If your order did not get filled  you have an open order and you would need to cancel it and your sol would return  Try going to the balances tab on the serum dex and hitting settle all Good job man  I will definitely add it to my rotation That s great to hear imaginary    Have a nice Sunday That worked  Appreciate the assistance definitely watch this with Raj Gokal   https   www youtube com watch v uHoxveeoHbw  https   www youtube com watch v uHoxveeoHbw  if you want detailed project history Thks guys  I got it Everyone stop what you are doing  We are going to wait for ETH 2 0 for three years       so funny  Think where Solana will be in three years Haha Maybe start with a tiny percent of tokens to verify it works Price  I thought this website was free Let me know if you need more help to find it Imaginary I joined Serum discord and Armani one of the admins helped me find it  He s the man  and was helping everyone in there What is a realistic price eoy Alright  So I ll pay it forward  I found mine  it was trapped in the order book  So if you use the convert tab  it s actually just throwing an order in the order book of the trading pair you wanted to convert  So go to the trading pair on the trading tab  scroll to the bottom and your order is likely sitting there ready to either cancel or settle Same exact thing happened to me last night  Still can t find the USDC and SOL is no longer in wallet  Hoping to solve it this morning  still nothing Probably it s not going to kill eth  But it s bringing really good fundamentals  What ETH will bring in 3 years if everything go well  Without delays They are going to complement each other  But at the end of the day  Sol can capture significant DeFi market share  Not other layer 1 blockchain offers so much speed and scale without compromising security Omg yet another ETH killer  Can we stop with this bullsh t once and for all and just enjoy the ride with Solana Keep updating the sub and thanks Meme   scam coins are not worth mentioning in context with all the other real projects doesnt solve the issue for me  Im using both firefox or brave  linux ubuntu and I tried different amounts of stake Hm i have the same issue as described above in firefox  and in brave I get the error U2F Timeout  when i should sign the transaction  Ledger nano s and linux here This right here  Exactly what I wanted to comment Any cooperation with BABB  BAX    Bank Account Based Blockchain  That would be huge http   youtu be fov_MareOPsgetbabb com hell ya Dude that s so funny  I have never seen anyone else use the term it s like getting in at the start of the stock market   I SAY THAT ALL THE TIME  It s complex shit man  I love just looking into all the technologies because they just sound so friggen cool and are actually needed  Once your done your investigating on Solana definitely just look at some other projects and keep digging man  There s a lot of really cool projects at the moment and if you see a space for it in the future then it has real world value That said I just brought some fucking Charizard coin for the lol s haha Source     S

or know where or how to do it  I am interested in learning how This was a great response  I appreciate it so much  I do think crypto is here to stay  I tried explaining it to a guy I work with that  for me  it s like getting into the stock market at the beginning of the stock market  Having no real understanding of blockchain itself  I have to kind of dumb it down for myself  If that makes any sense  I do understand what these technologies do as far as with transaction speed and such  So when I was doing some reading  I really liked Solana and the more I research it the more I love it and it s long term potential  My Doge investment was more of a make quick run on some profit and then put that into something with longer term potential and that is Solana I actually thought I had more time before Doge ran  Didn t think that was coming til mid summerand was hoping to put more into it before it moved so quick  But I think Doge is more of a meme coin  I know people will make money with it but for me  I don t feel comfortable holding it long term  Solana on the other hand  could be like getting in on Apple at the beginning Okay used Raydium  really nice and easy to use  Thanks again for the advice Nah I didn t even know they have one haha  I use a website that aggregates portfolios of top traders   hedges Thanks  I will take a look at the Solana Podcast and The Antidote

podcast or something Hmm  How do you mean exactly   If it s in coinbase I think they have a stake section but I d use Exodus if I were you    cheers Aww yiss  glad it s resolved  I ll totally hop on board the network congestion train  I d even go so far as to speculate fanfiction to justify the network congestion  Perhaps an enigmatic crypto mogul needed more server resources before you to complete a multi million  SOL sales contract to fund their environment saving green energy initiative  and your slow transaction helped them get their foot in the door  Your suffering only helps humankind  Oh Binance  why do you have to be so popular that you get network congestion issues Not OP but this is an impressive response  Thx It is generally my opinion that  stored in a pdf  does not count as safe key storage  I personally wouldn t even do any copy pasting to print it out  but that s probably excess paranoia  I still hear stories of 6  figs vanishing because keys were stored on a weak PC or the cloud  and you never know what your wallet might be worth someday  Ymmv but please stay safe fens What courses next     Looking into building the following   Solana Validator 101 Training  Solana Wallets 101 Training  Solana Project XYZ Training  Rust for Solana 101 TrainingAny suggestions you said that sooo perfectly ansi and interesting _ease are correct Try restoring them with another wallet like oxygen and or mathwallet Trying using Raydium with your exodus wallet lolololol because if you want to interact with smart contracts   sollet is the standard right now  Not gonna lie and say its an amazing product but ive been using it for a month now and havent had a single issue  Folks just arent experienced with actually using blockchains    its good though  they are learning  use the sollet  and if you want help with shit feel free to PM me For anyone coming here in the future   I found  https   rustinblockchain org   https   rustinblockchain org   which is not strictly solana but relevant Sorry meant million not billion That guy left that comment about waiting to buy till it got to 60 cents 171 days ago which would be November 12th 2020  Solano s stock was 1 90 on that day  I m looking at Solano today and wondering if I should buy it at 50 dollars a share today on May 1st 2021 Yeah  only been in crypto for a few days    so I m still getting the hang of it all  I too think this is a great project  tried to understand the white paper  and look at the company profile  all looks legit and the guys running this have a lot of experience under their belts  Gonna keep HODLing hehe gt I have seen the words a thousand times and they are well writtenHave you restored your Sollet wallet before using those Seed Words so you say you re 100  sure they are correct  amp  well saved  gt the next button is still disabledMake sure there is no extra space bar between the words or at the end Just sent some  let me know if you need any help  thank you for taking the time out of the day to look into our community 5KeA65ywRUwpJHqhvjNzTyHQ7ugFrvgRKdJfwWv7pdLpThis is my Solana on exodus  Thank you  ill be making my kin wallet tomorrow Yeah it did  His price prediction in the short term is bearish There should be a link to contact support at the bottom of the website  I heard they have pretty shitty customer service so it could take awhile Lmao what are you talking about    You delegate to validators in Solana as well  Ethereum is behind because it s the only Proof of Stake coin which doesn t implement delegation natively  You instead need to use things like rocket pool Thanks for this  What s the best way to contact binance  Through email  And do you have an idea how long it might take That s not how supply and demand works  And frankly  half of the alt coins think they will displace eth  but most of the people don t actually understand the compromises these other coins make to have the other advantages You can contact Binance and hope they can recover it  If they cant recover it then theyre gone forever What s you SOL address  I can send you enough to create a token account if you d like Ah  I don t have any Solana to start this with  I ll see what I can do later I guess Ok  but after two weeks I still didn t receive any reward Youd think those posts would make people want to transfer their SOL to a better wallet  but nope lol I am using Exodus too and setting it up  transferring coins to it and working with it is super easy  It is becoming boring to see those sollet posts every day I d recommend people use exodus  I see those posts every day too  Makes me wonder if it s user error or if sollett is just trash Cardano and Avalanche are not proof of stake  They are Delegated Proof of Stake networks  The reality is most so called PoS networks are not actually trying to implement Proof of Stake  because proof is stake is hard That s in part why I think Solana is such an interesting project  and the only one that has a chance of catching up to Ethereum  The Beacon Chain is already a fully functional PoS network and the merge will probably happen before the end of the year  So Ethereum is ahead PoS wise  and in market share  developers  researchers  etc   but Solana solved a problem Ethereum has still not solved  scalability   I don t think only one project will survive  or anything like that  but Solana is for me the only network that has a shot at overtaking Ethereum id love to see them and add em to my collection if you feel like reposting Honestly  I don t see polkadot winning the interoperability battle with Cosmos  Dot is a cool project with great devs  but their system is already significantly inferior to the Cosmos blockchains IMO  Solana is already planning interoperability with Cosmos  which I see as far more important in the long run  I m sure they will eventually develop IBC with Polkadot  but I don t think we need to be in a hurry Try FTX us   Send usdc or usdt directly to and from sollet and ftx us without worrying about formats and virtually for free parachains are blockchains  There are many different blockchains trying to get added to the polkadot ecosystem  Kedana is a proof of work one trying to get added  Enjin is a proof of stake one trying to get added  The reason why polkadot is valued at such a high valuation with basically no product  is the allure that very easy interoperability can occur within the ecosystem https   twitter com solana status 1334928208836272129 s 21Lmao I just have to say I laughed at the electric toothbrush comment Yes  the next big step with Solana is the application of a decentralized on chain governance system  If that happens successfully  things like this could never happen  However  I do think this was a wakeup call for the foundation to be more transparent as shown from the added tracking mechanisms listed in the article Also the nice thing is Solana is proof of history with a little bit of proof of stake mixed in for edge cases  I don t think it should be viewed as proof of stake  its just an extra security mechanism Remember those other coins have been out for 4 5 years  We just entered the top 15 and bullrun just started  Eyes will be on us  Solana is executing and moving at a rapid pace Hahhahahahh It doesn t matter  the fact that if turn down the main cluster it shut down the whole network  if you shut down all China mining pool bitcoin network is still up and running Whelp  not sure if this helps anyone but   I just logged back into Sollet  reconnected my MetaMask wallet after it disconnected  and I was immediately promoted to approve the transaction  Once approved it went through just fine  So I think what I said about having to send it to MetaMask first was incorrect  Hope this helps someone out in the future gt PoS networks overall have all the same problem  when staking rewards will be less profitable than lending DeFi rewards of the same equivalent of    people will get off staking and put it all to lending  making the network less secure Pretty easily solved by making tokens that represent tokens that are being staked and are price pegged   https   medium com everett protocol why a staking reward in proof of stake is economically flawed bcd71bb493bd  https   medium com everett protocol why a staking reward in proof of stake is economically flawed bcd71bb493bd There are some kinks that arise when meshing multiple chains together like how Kadena does  For example  to withdraw a Kadena token fromm bitrex it must go be transferred on chain 0 as of now  What happens when that chain becomes overused  Would a exchange such as Serum be able to work on Kadena and route token transfers through multiple chains automatically  The answer is likely no  As also seen from  https   kadenaswap chainweb com bountyswap  https   kadenaswap chainweb com bountyswap  which works on chain 0 right now  This is what makes Solana so unique is the fact there is only one chain Proof of stake makes sense because if you choose to compromise the network  then your own tokens that you are staking will decrease in value drastically to the point where they become illiquid if a big attack were to occur  And the nice thing about Solana  is its really not pure proof of stake Lastly  this is an awesome project and I definitely think the tech is cool  Proof of work mining has issues however as well  If they really wanted the network to be secured by their participants  they would have used a hashing algorithm such as kawpow  But instead its basically only mineable with ASICs  which is a highly centralized industry as seen from the recent bitcoin crash when only 2 regions of china lost power and 50  of the hashrate vanished for a while Also  as a proof of work blockchain  the chain or chains in Kadena s case  is inherently insecure until a large amount of the WORLDs hashrate is working on the chain  At any moment  one of the large pools in China mining bitcoin could compromise the network because there is such a low amount of miners on the network in comparison  So until Kadena becomes the largest or near the largest blockchain in the world by hashing power  it is inherently insecure Lastly  the environmental costs of mining will only increase  and with greater governmental crackdowns on unnecessary global warming  I think proof of work is not likely to stick around very much longer Is there an episode in particular to check out  I get the same feeling that the whole ETH KILLER argument is silly because a lot of these chains will complement one another would be super interested in learning setting up validator and maintaining it    more Rust for Solana is also interesting I love Solana the more I read about it  but the one thing I wonder is how it s going to fair against all the meme scam coins that have erupted on BSC because of the low TX fees  Hopefully all that nonsense stays over on BSC and doesn t migrate to Solana any time soon Nah I m just saying the conservative players  gov ts and such  are going to want it to use the tech  While the more adventurous wild west types will keep continue plowing capital into promising looking  but possibly higher risk reward technologies as they see opportunity  Neither is better  just different tradeoffs  use cases  and user bases Where   how do I buy  SOL  Can I hold it in Meta Mask No but they re attracting a lot of attention from high frequency traders trading platforms  Most notably FTX and Alameda Research  The scalability of Solana has bigger entities interested in getting involved nothing is wrong with your post  saved your beautiful image too False  Solana is absolutely decentralized  Theres 700  and growing  validators securing the network  Nobody can  shut down the whole blockchain   Where do you get this info from  Stop spreading FUD I agree in general  although metamask is a much better wallet experience for instance   but I suspect a lot of people having issues are new to the whole scene and don t have that experience  Indeed one of the reasons  IMO anyway  Solana is seeing the bump in users is because new people want to get into defi and the costs of Ethereum are prohibitive lol you need to allow popups on firefox or just use chrome  You havent even sent the transaction to the blockchain   When you do send the transaction you ll see it confirms in a couple seconds  and costs fractions of a penny That s fair  I get that  Honestly I wouldn t mind paying the fee and being the test dummy  But I think our issues are different enough that this might not be a solution for me  but I m not sure  Although Sollet is connected to my MetaMask  I didn t actually send it to my MetaMask address  I think that s what you re supposed to do    So when I look at my MetaMask  there is no record or indication of this transaction really depends on what your goals are  what you re trying to know Ok thx I will look in to it Its not any more complicated than using ethereum to interact with the Sushiswap protocol I have not paid the  50 gas fee to see if the funds will move because it seems like they were stuck in Limbo to begin with  and I m not gonna waste my money If ultimately his goal is to get to Kucoin then yes  he will need to do that  Spend  40 to get it over the bridge and then spend another  20 to send the USDT from metamask to kucoin    unless Kucoin has an SPL wallet integrated I saw your post when I was researching a solution  It looked like essentially the same thing that happened to me  but I wasn t completely sure  Sucks that so many people are having this same problem   1 for devs looking  into this if it s a bug 3 Pools control Bitcoin  4 Pools Control Ethereum and they are in China  Solana 1 3 validators are over 15 increasing every month  they are not in China Yeah im just gonna disagree and say doing anything to raise awareness is gonna help the cause Can the devs please look into this bug  It s happening to so many people bridging between SPL and ERC20  Funds go into limbo awesome I believe it s just called the Solana podcast  They have it on apple podcasts  I m sure you can find it mostly anywhere podcasts are published First of all  Solana IS NOT decentralized  the main cluster shutdown turn off the whole  blockchain Just another software that s one line of code from being replace just like the majority of these coins don t bet the farm on it Regardless of what you think about a particular candidate crypto is meant to be inclusive  If you endorse any presidential candidate you will be at odds with at least 40 50  of the community  If that s a reflection of a business that he started runs like FTX fine  But in 4 years and whoever the candidates are we better not have one blockchain for libshits and another for cuckservitives Kucoin doesn t support SPL yet  so sending your Sollet USDT  SPL Version  may lead to the loss of those USDT As always    my golden rule in crypto    make sure to send small amount for testing before sending the whole amount Good advice   if this doesn t help  disconnect your wallet from Serum  F5  Refresh  the Serum web page  amp  reconnect your wallet again  amp  check your accountagain While I applaud your intent  this is like swimming against the current  This is the internet  and of all places  Reddit   Even sites that provide news for a living give wrong advice  If there are posts that are obviously wrong  hoping enough commenters will correct it thanks that makes sense Any advice on umm   how to do that  I can t find that sort of thing on sollet   or do you mean on dex Edit  I got it  you are amazing  lt 3 RPC servers are overloaded there are alternative RPC servers popping up for Solana even paid membership servers to handle high amount of requests  I saw  Media network  https   Media network  even offers bandwidth on solana as a decentralized provider but I am not sure if it is live  What you experience is not caused by the blockchain With 3rd party nodes you still get a lot of assurances which vary with the specific blockchain protocol being used  3rd party nodes can never spoof or modify your transactions  or change your actual balance  Depending on protocol  they may be able to show you spoofed balances through your wallet software though  And of course they can accept your transaction and just never broadcast it  silently denying you service until you switch to a more cooperative node The damage they could do is very limited if you re just an average joe trying to send a transaction  but for businesses who need high assurances about their transactions  it can make a difference Plus  I m sure Solana has learned from earlier blockchain protocols to make their light clients as secure as possible Banks have unilateral control over your money  Third party nodes are more like a delivery guy delivering a check   he can t cash it because it s not written out to him  but he can throw it in a ditch if he wants  Then you just write a new check  no big deal Do you have the name of the podcast you can send over check for unsettled balances and just settle them Glad it helped  sometime a tiny edit can make huge difference Use a vpn change countries and should be fineAlso depending on country minimum exchange amount will change It does sound quite unfortunate how in crypto it s moved towards trusting 3rd party nodes  What s the difference between them and banks as middlemen Have checked the    Documentation    https   docs solana com  Check Solana Discord too  that s the best place for developers  a friendly community that will answer whatever you have in mind   Discord   https   discord com invite pquxPsq  https   discord com invite pquxPsq Sure it also depends of your needs For example if you need a blockchain with no transactions fee at all then Solana is not an option If you want privacy like using secure enclave it s not the right choice Do you need smart contract Do you want fast transaction and finality Near free low cost of transaction You won t need to store a lot off data on chain or are ready to pay for storage rent Then definitely dig into Solana documentation gt d completely on Solana or even Serum  He should be seen as one of the most important and influential advocates of Solana and the face of Serum   But he  shouldn t be seen as the face of Solana  The tokenomics of his you are right about the creator of Serum  him donating to Biden should not be a reflection of Solana  I can t help it not to get irritated with him  the guy as smart as he is in the financial world that dumbo is he in recognising shitty and useless politicians like Biden and his commie bunch If your system isn t robust to an old idiot with a computer in a closet running a validator  your system isn t robust Ethereum is robust enough  and my guess is that Solana is too Solana Discord is the best place IMO to find what you re looking for   Discord   https   discord com invite pquxPsq  https   discord com invite pquxPsq This was solved  For non confirmed transactions in metamask  they will be there for you to confirm  You just need to connect your metamask with sollet app and it will show up again Thank you for the warning Ok   didn t catch that  I thought he was specifically asking how to move it to ethereum so he could send to kucoin  Sorry for the confusion It means in practice that users have to trust those who are running full nodes that the blockchain is valid  Without high end hardware  they can t run their own full node that makes sure that all the transactions  signatures  etc  are valid and thus that the Solana chain is valid  anybody know how Solana handles light clients btw  It probably doesn t mean much in practice  The trend over the years in crypto has been towards end users no longer running their own nodes  but instead trusting 3rd party nodes like Infura to relay their transactions  anyways When you have literally billions of dollars at stake  yea  there kinda is  Anyone can do it  but that doesn t mean that everyone should do it what s the problem with my post I m up for writing an article about common mistake to avoid and best practices What should I mention I m not talking about running a validator  I m talking about running a full node As a side note  there s no reason to gatekeep running a validator Ask him directly he is on discord How van I buy  Please explain for an idiot like me Binance com gt Not decentralized enough  folks like to come on here and complain that every man women and child aren t running a node from their electric toothbrush Amen gt needs to persuade developers to get building on itWell  they did just start another hackathon  And since it uses Rust  which  I m not a developer  but I understand is a very popular language  even outside of the crypto space   it will open up the pool of potential candidates thx Im not smart enough bud   just want to diversify my portfolio with other cryptos it s 99  Solana right now and I cant exchange it He talked about using GPU in BPF  But I don t see any implementation of it  https   docs solana com developing on chain programs overview  https   docs solana com developing on chain programs overview I think part of the problem is everyone trying to ape into this and there being a sense of urgency to get in early  Well  the problem is that if you re new to crypto it s gonna take a while to figure out  and Solana probably even moreso Where would you say is the best place to know all about it OP can you go to the Shitcoin reddit and post your shit  Thanks again More sensitivity to collusion attack  deny of service  etc  More risk of cartel behavior     Basically  less safety  Remember that validators collectively decide the state of the ledger  including the state of your wallet  the coin issuance policy and so on I am not saying any bad thing will happen  The team is highly respectable  But in my opinion the whole point of decentralized finance was decentralization  and therefore resistance against cartel behavior  Otherwise  I may just use the good old banking system I like to say if you ve ever figured out how to play a video game without reading the instruction pamphlet that everyone ignores  you re more than capable to figure out how to use blockchains to interact with smart contract protocols   And YES  one of my favorite things about solana is that i can send someone just a few dollars and teach them how to make swaps  what that even means   what a liquidity pool is and how to add to it  what a farm is and why its so revolutionary  etc You cant send it to any address you can only send it to your metamask  Which incurs a transaction fee that will  cost between 30 60 USD worth of Eth   To avoid paying those transaction fees  OP wants to stay on the solana blockchain It is up to Solana to build and maintain the blockchain  They are not responsible for teaching us how to use blockchain technologies to interact with smart contract protocols  This is partly why I m offering my knowledge to the community im not too familiar with exodus tbh but if you re trying to exchange for something in the solana ecosystem i would highly recommend setting up a sollet  sending SOL there  and learning how to use the raydium protocol    PM me if you run into any issues What does that loss of decentralisation mean in practice though  Once the 488m coins are released could transaction costs suddenly rocket  Could the validators form a union and monopolise  I don t know just brainstorming lol With validators  having 600 different ones sounds a lot  especially since still in BETA mode and less than a year old  I think ethereum has less than 4000 I do understand the decentralised argument though because the way the coins are distributed is not straight forward  There was less than 50m in December  now there is 270m and the price is 30 times higher  Who has got those extra 220m coins  Its all very confusing  Also the transparency report hasn t been released by Solana since December I joined at 8000 members  Great to see it growing   every little helps I think ETH 2 a long time a way but I believe they will be able to get fast cheap transactions eventually  Surely they could even copy the PoH mechanism from Solana and input that quite easily if they wanted Hardware requirements are high enough that you need a several thousand dollar computer with 128GB of ram  two SSDs and a good internet connection to run a node that fully validates the blockchain Solana embodies the typical blockchain trilemma compromise   Decentralized  Scalable  Secure  pick two  Everyone here will tell you that Solana is still  decentralized enough   and they are likely right  but that doesn t change the fact that Solana sacrifices  some amount  of decentralization to improve scaling compared to older gen blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum  Some people are uncomfortable with that amount of sacrifice Depends on your financial situation  Buy as much as you can UI UX Biggest complaint I ve heard   Not enough users   this is quickly rectifying itself    Not decentralized enough  folks like to come on here and complain that every man women and child aren t running a node from their electric toothbrush  Again more and more validators are popping up over time  The hardware requirements are strict so that solana can scale  SBF    This is my own criticism it s not a downside but more of a rant   One of the most influential entrepreneurs in crypto decided to build his dex on Solana because he evaluated it as the best suited L1 because of its speed and ability to scale  Prior to that he had no involvement  Sam is great for Solana  Serum and his other projects  will continue to be extremely successful  But some people like to pretend he is calling all of the shots at Solana which he clearly isn t  I think this rhetoric could ultimately be harmful  He has his hands in many things  FTX  SRM  OXY  Maps  Alameda  Blockfolio    He is not focused completely on Solana or even Serum  He should be seen as one of the most important and influential advocates of Solana and the face of Serum   But he  shouldn t be seen as the face of Solana  The tokenomics of his projects  good or bad  simply are not a reflection of Solana  Which politicians he donates to are not a reflection of Solana  The rhetoric of claiming all Solana price action is due to him does everyone a disservice and Sam isn t the one spreading it  All of this is all coming from a huge fan with a big bag of Serum that I hold dear to my heart  SAM    SOLANA Even with the Eth updates  it would still not be fast enough for something like Point of Sale  or even running an Automated Market Maker  and it doesn t seem like it wants to either  Solana can will soon  Projects that require that kind of speed are likely to be built on solana I think  Even with Eth2  there will be things that just can t be done on that chain and for good reasons too  Hopefully  they co exist  and are used together  Buy a house  use eth  buy a phone  use sol lol I would just like to know when I can exchange Solana on  Exodus  Its the only crypto ion my portfolio I cant exchange   Not smart enough to use Serum  Is it normal for it to be unavailable for exchange for days  about 5 now at a time Scam alert   Do not send any Solana to this website  The channel shows a lot of subscribers but if you click on the channel it s full with kids videos    Beware I guess strengths for me are all about use cases where a crypto project adds value to peopleFor Solana to achieve this  needs to persuade developers to get building on it  I think that s the challengeWhat is to stop people building on ethereum instead  They plan on faster cheaper transactions in the future just like Solana  I guess the difference is Solana  maybe like BSC   are achieving that right now It is up to Solana to post  How to  information  and people wanting to be helpful here should quote it and include a link   Otherwise people are guessing about a very complex tech topic It would really come down to what you think are strengths weaknesses in a crypto project  It can easily handle way more than it does now  and as hardware and network speeds increase  it will scale up much much higher  The downsides right now are  it s young  projects are still getting fully fleshed out on it  but lots of progress   It needs more diversity in validators  growing everyday   It s technically still in mainnet beta which makes some people uneasy  This also means governance is still an experiment and fragile despite that things are going well IHMO  Right now  I can t think of a project I m more excited for Oh  you found it fishy   https   www youtube com watch v oBW2KJq3FnA amp ab _channel NervosNetwork  https   www youtube com watch v oBW2KJq3FnA amp ab_channel NervosNetwork  watching this might reduce your fish  Anatoly will explain to you how it works Then why is there a tab on sollet usdt under send that says  erc20 usdt  and  spl usdt can be converted to erc20 usdt via metamask    Doesn t it allow you to connect to metamask and do exactly what the OP is trying to do I ve seen people mention it but never checked it out  Maybe I ll give it a look  At this point though I m just waiting for Phantom to either send me a damn invite or to go live Coin98 is a sweet mobile wallet  Can t stake from it as far as I know but it has like every spl token  Cope  maps  oxy  srm  step  Ray et all  I know it somehow hooks to certain exchanges but I haven t tried that  Read somewhere that the Alemeda boys are investors so not sure what the plans are or why it doesn t get more marketing but I know it s Asia based and Exodus is US fwiw Yup  agreed  There s no denying though that it s n00b friendly  I ve set my parents up there and it s just fine for what they want to do  The Trezor functionality is good too  and when they support SOL it will be a very good place to hodl Yes  not to mention that exchanging on there is a fooking rip off even when working properly  It s just fine to hold  stake  and send but that is it Although I like the sound of high tps and 0 4s tx time  What I found fishy was while looking at this official article https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs  Solana is still hashing on SHA256 on CPU cores How is it possible to get such a low tx time when the algorithm is implemented on CPU  There two possibilities  this document is outdated and the algorithm has been implemented for CUDA or something is fishy  Please guide me if I missed out any details This  And as I mentioned in another post  Exodus send receive and exchange functionality for a whole host of coins  Solana frequently being one of them  are down WAAAAAAY too often for it to be much use for anything other than holding and staking  Even staking for that matter has issues it seems  I literally just sent a bag over to stake and I m getting some kinda error that I have no idea what it means  I ve been staking some there for a week or so too  so I dunno what s going on  And that s setting aside all the other points you made Most chains have an event like this at some point if you read the whole history In order to provide these services more than a good cryptocurrency  a community that uses it is needed  many currencies already cover those needs but there is still no great community behind it gt its good though  they are learningAnd thankfully  as long as you follow good general practice  Solana is a great chain to learn on since it s so fast and cheap  If people just follow a couple easy rules  there shouldn t be any issues  Send small amounts at first to understand how things work  Copy and paste your addresses  and make sure to double check them before you send  Other than that  it isn t incredibly difficult  especially after the recent change to Sollet where you can send any SPL token to your root SOL address Exodus is fine for what it is  and it s very enticing for staking SOL for a variety of reasons  However  too often the ability to send receive SOL  and several other coins for that matter  is down for whatever reason  Right now for instance DOT is unavailable to send receive  and several other coins the exchange functionality is not available  If you just want to hold it s prob fine  and even better if you want to stake  but it s far from a perfect solution  especially if you re active in your dealings Who told you Solana is GPU accelerated gt Firefox says parts of this website are not secureWhat parts  Ill install and check it out  Thanks Good advice yes  please never share your private keys  and restore your wallet before using it to ensure proper operation First fix the lag  I only see circles all day  It s a mess right now Equating Cardano s consensus to EOS and BSC is pretty funny  Not sure why you think delegation is a security hole  I d prefer a network where a majority of coins are staked rather than a very small percent  Not everyone can run a validator and that s especially true for Solana Me either just good to see numbers and interest picking up i m down Firefox says parts of this website are not secure Woooo   FUNDS ARE SAFU in your opinion  what is a good amount  to hold and potentially  make some profits in 2021 If you look at this subreddit compared to crypto s with similar market cap  VeChain and Stellar for example  the numbers on here are significantly lower  Not sure why though Thank you very much for answering  there was an error in a letter  I do not speak English very well  that s why my mistake  happily I have been able to restore my account Thank you very much for answering  there was an error in a letter  I do not speak English very well  that s why my mistake  happily I have been able to restore my account I havent delved too deep into SOL yet  just bought some and hodl em on Exodus so I got nothing else atm  but at least now I know about SPL haha is there any lock in period  or if you click unstake it s immed Please  feel free to pick my brain if you have any questions  I dont know it all but im certainly trying to Ah ok Needed that What website gt or at the very least the locationThis is an important  and I suspect oft overlooked  thing to look at IMO because the last time I looked  you ll find several validators that are in what appears to be the same datacenter  Ideally you would want to spread your stake around to different validators  but if they re all located in the same geographic area  or much worse the same datacenter  then you re introducing risk It is on multiple chains at this point  but is native to Ethereum  ERC 20    If you google SPL USDT you ll see stuff pointing to Solana great explanation   thanks   i was excited when i noticed them running faster as well   mainly due to increased frequency of staking rewards I only stake using Solflare  and do it through my ledger     I would suggest a validator that has no more than 10  fees   and ones that have a website that you can click on and see a little bit about the team or at the very least the location  Pick one that resonates with you   If you re staking an amount that is very very important to you  I would consider splitting your stack and staking in more than one validator   This is good for centralization     And dont be attracted to a node just because it has a ton of staked SOL in it  staking in smaller pools is just as safe  just as profitable  and promotes decentralization of the network Weird  I googled  what network is USDT  and every result was ERC 20 You are talking about foundation staked validators  which indeed is the most certain way for someone without any other way to start with significant stake  to do so   I didn t realize that foundation nodes had to put in 24K of their own stake   In fact I think it s very likely that that is wrong and that they don t have to put in anything They do  however  have to prove the quality of their validator by going through at least one stage of the Tour de SOL program  where validators run on testnet and are evaluated for their performance   You cannot even participate until you have registered  and registration is closed at the moment I am pretty sure   Not sure when the next stage starts   You can check here https   solana com validator registrationIn addition  the foundation has put the whole foundations taking program on hold for new validators while they tune their process  so I don t know when that is even going to start back up again   But in the interim they are at least offering  500 worth of SOL to anyone who completes a Tour de SOL stage   And you can complete multiple stages for multiple  500 awards I don t disagree  but it s worth pointing out the difference  Not everyone is going to have the time or patience to use Solflare unfortunately So where do you stake  And which validator Ok i guess  1 points for Exodus for at least letting you own the keys  I still think its worth it for a number of reasons to use something like Solflare instead or else  buy some now  buy more if dip occursdollar cost average Yes the 1 5 19 version of the Solana software which was released about a week and a half ago made a big difference   The Solana developers tuned some things that made the whole network more efficient and as a result  brought epoch times down Theoretically slots take 400 ms and an epoch takes exactly two days   But that s never going to be achieved to perfection because there will always be network delays and skipped slots here and there   Up until 1 5 19  epochs were close to 3 days   Now they are about 2 days 18 hours  an improvement of about 10  which is what you noticed The good news is that this has pushed the APY up   because stake rewards are paid out the same amount no matter how long an epoch takes  shorter epochs means more frequent payouts which means higher APY   Just the 10  reduction in epoch times with 1 5 19 resulted in close to a 1  APY increase And I think that with time and more tuning  epochs will get even faster  which will mean even better returns No  they partnered with Everstake  So yes  it is better for the network overall to use Solflare and spread your stake around  but it is not the same as letting an exchange hold your money AND delegate your stake Ah ok that makes more sense haha Does exodus let you choose a validator to delegate to  or do they choose it for you   If they let you choose then yeah its a good option  If they dont then stay away Staking and unstaking take effect at the next epoch boundary   So if the moment you decide to stake or unstake is close to a boundary  it could take a pretty short time   But if you make your choice right after an epoch starts  then you will end up waiting basically all of that epoch That doesn t really apply for Exodus  It would be the same as using Solflare to stake with Everstake Aren t a lot of Solana concentrated in a few hands  Maybe these people just keep buying more You want to stake it yourself using something like  solflare com  https   solflare com   If you give your SOL to a centralized exchange for the sake of staking you are giving a third party possession of your tokens  This defeats the whole ethos of crypto  Its important to take the time and learn how to do these things yourself  Dont let laziness sink in and take your power of freedom and sovereignty from yourself and give it right back to institutions Nice work fren Thanks Why not  it s a meme coin  No use case  It s a pump and dump It is possible to stake SOL on Binance Guy   i dont know if Kucoin has a SPL receiving address but you CAN NOT send USDT from sollet to an ERC 20     This wouldbe like sending bitcoin to an ethereum address  IT WILL BE LOST FOREVER IF YOU DO THIS   I would suggest making an account with  FTX US  https   FTX US     as their exchange is by far the most compatible with Solana products Nope  anything in Sollet is on solana   if you send USDT from solana blockchain to an Ethereum receiving address you will lose all your USDT forever When you unstake your Lp tokens and check them out on the liquidity tab  It should show the 50 50 breakup between the two  The only thing that can cause a difference is a price divergence causing impermanent loss I wonder when some basic financial tools will be added 1  The ability to send a remittance to someone in another country  like Western Union  but without the high fee 2  The ability to purchase goods  software  or subscriptions over the internet quickly and cheaply  3  The ability to purchase goods in a physical store  like buying lunch I m staking in Exodus Lol can t tell if trolling or serious Solflare still deciding which validator to pick
2021-05-03,46.90397832,49.00945447,45.04447696,41 42 would have been excellent    doubt we make it back there  I might settle for 47 at this point but no guarantees as I think we are poised for more run up I avoid twitter  Like it s  that part of town Again  I think it s an issue of the communities understanding of what is actually going on being the issue  and why a network like Solana is needed to take this space to the next level  It isn t an indicator of more people using it  it s simply an indication of what the network can handle  Those transactions are no different than any other  real  transaction  And if you want to be able to handle things like a central limit order book  or say a messaging app  or whatever  you re going to need that type of cheap processing power Once you understand what is going on with the transactions with Serum  why it s like that and why it s needed  a lot of what they re trying to do on Solana and in the Serum ecosystem becomes clear  It s just gonna take a while for people to get out of their current thinking of what the crypto defi space is thanks for posting this  i too am interested in running a node but being is that solana is relatively new there isnt much available on the matter    seems a lot better to invest a few k into some hardware than to stake 32 eth is 1K realistic Yeh I mean theres still good proof of concept that they can process this many transactions this quickly and cheaply  I ve just seen a bunch of news articles recently talking about how theyre already doing 10x transactions as ether or whatever number it is and framing it like there s already huge usage in it  If the bulk is order cancellations  it changes the picture a little bit The only downside I can see  not technical  is that it s still not available on major CEXs   Binance us  https   Binance us   Coinbase KuCoin and etc It s one of those things that you see people talking shit about how they re fake transactions etc  but they really don t understand what exactly is even happening  Since Serum is the first  and only  on chain central limit order book though  it s a new concept for a lot of people perfect  that site is just what I was looking for  Thanks Ah yeah sorry Im retarded  I mean Exodus Wallet not Kraken Same  This my primary way at investing in projects too Gotcha that makes the most sense If you want engagement get on Twitter I think it s a nice option to hodl and stake  but of course now Im having issues staking which is making me reconsider that notion lol Average in  Take 50 80  of what you wanted to spend and go in now  Should you discover a dip  go in with the rest  Then you don t miss a boat And the big thing is  solana didn t go through the dips when Bitcoin and the broader market just did  This suggests a lack of popularity  good for now  or resilience  also good   So  you are buying in cheap I ve checked it out  but I still don t see a dollar amount of what I m earning  For example cake will always tell me how much I ve earned in the day and from which pools I m earning it  Step just shows me the overall value of each coin and LP token I have Are they still building step out to have these features No problem  Also  make note that USDC on coinbase is an ERC20 token  native to Etheruem ecosystem  while USDC in the solana ecosystem is an SPL token  so you CAN NOT send directly from coinbase to sollet and vice versa  To send a token out from sollet you need to transfer out to an exchange that accepts SPL native tokens  eg FTX  or convert it via and into Metamask Coins are frequently unavailable to deposit withdraw and trade on their exchange in Exodus  I do not see SOL listed as such currently  however  since yesterday  I ve been unable to add more stake  So it would appear something is up  but of course when I sent an email to support I got the standard  we ll get back to you as soon as we can  we re overloaded with requests due to increased interest  email  I did just post something on their Reddit a few min ago though to try to get some answers  so I guess we ll see https   twitter com SolanaDoge I m in Jersey  Binance US Uhh    Kraken doesn t even have SOL listed  let alone the option to stake I guess that depends on calculating potential gains from the token value increasing  versus the current APR  versus the potential loss from impermanent loss  That s quite a bit to calculate  I personally would probably bring in USDC from an outside source It s not live yet  The site is just a mockup This has been discussed several times  It s mostly from Serum  and since Serum is a central limit order book  most of those transactions are cancellations so that market makers can set accurate prices Well I m glad to hear the foundation has at least recognized there is a problem and is addressing it  I d not heard it discussed anywhere  although I don t hang out on discord much so  may have missed it  I still don t understand the issue with the foundation not being able to do business in the US  I guess I assumed that if the token can be traded in the US then they d be good  but apparently not  I understand they have a ton of things on their plate right now and it s probably a low priority  but they really oughtta do something about that  Surely there is a lot of interest from US entities to validate On solflare there you get around 12 5 are you able to access solfarm  i clicked on vaults and nothing happened Best way to stake so far i know is to but it on solflare there you get 13 Assuming you re talking about Marinade  check their site  It s listed at the bottom We hope so Same i got in at 7 dollar It does actually show where the usage is coming from  Go here to the instruction breakdown https   solanabeach ioIts mostly serum Probably kin  it s the largest amount of accounts on Solana newbie question  When compounding  in this case with STEP reward  Is it better to harvest and swap half for USDC  Or bring the necessary USDC from outside Yeah  those are all transactions  But Solana fees are almost nill So indeed there s fees for every step  unstaking  swapping  etc They fixed  Just now  today Solfarm will be awesome  excited for that People will leave their tokens staked and then be able to use their staked tokens for basically an i owe you of your staked token and use that for defi  Already happening in cosmos  Read the first link i sent  Didnt know that about kadena miners Step finance is a good portfolio viewer May I know what are the ways to get Solana based projected recognised as like this  Thanks I think the only issue here would be tax accountability  If you aren t worried about that  the transaction fees are so low  it doesn t really matter Solflare wallet also worksEdit  on that note  it s always a great idea to withdraw your coins off exchanges So much great innovation landing on Solana  Onward Where can you buy this  I m New York based and looking for a way in Great tips thanks There will be a pullback  There always is I m liking what solana is trying to do  Shame this community seems quite  I ve recently put 100  in quite late in to it vi think but interested to see where this coin can reach What are its scalability options  It seems to have alot of projects working of the platform Im brand new to all of this   o   So  for example  my eth on voyager is collecting 6 5  apy  Is that the same thing as staking  Is my eth staked I don t believe Binance can be used by any Americans at all  I read of a bunch of folks getting their Binance accounts frozen because they are trading on the Euro   Global platform    That s why they created Binance US  to run under US security guidelines     Cheers I assume you have a typo as not quite sure MTX Audio is to Sol what Binance is to BSC you can either use a wallet like exodus or stake on exchanges that support it  Binance or FTX are ones that I know do it Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns same error with 1 RAY in SOL or USCD How does one go about staking it Honestly a recent mindset change in me with crypto which has been nothing short of liberating is to simply find projects you believe in and buy them at whatever price point whenever you can Forget about dips or wether we re in the middle of a bull market or about to go bearish  if you believe in the project long term none of that should matter You can stake in the Exodus wallet LOL  Thats a first  Wash transactions to pump usage  Brilliant Just buy as soon as possible Ok got you  so there must be 80k validators on Eth2 Yeah completely agree on that red flag  Seems odd it doesn t get more attention Hi  I m also new to Solana relatively  I have been experiencing an error in Swap continuously  I m trying to Swap from USDC to RAY  but after accepting signature  my swaps kept being rejected  Actually  I once swapped from USDC to MEDIA a couple days ago so for me it s not very first time to do so  but keep being rejected for last 2 days  I m using Mathwallet  Also  I ve never used Trading function in RAYDIUM  but today I connected the wallet  the same Mathwallet   and tried to buy RAY by USDC  but the trading platform doesn t recognize my USDC in the wallet  while at least the swap platform recognized USDC in the wallet  I want to accumulate more RAY on the strength  Please kindly let me know your advice  Thank you very much Facts gt   swap my RAY in SOL    gt    gt  Also tried to swap RAY in USDC also in my wallet Try smaller amount  amp  see if it goes through Hi Mate yeah sure no worries about beta just dont know if its my fault or from phantom wallet I tried to stake RAY which i have in wallet on raydium and also tried to swap my RAY in SOL which i have also both in my wallet already Also tried to swap RAY in USDC also in my wallet Simple staking rewards u with lower APR but is way safer compared to farming  Farming exposes u to Impermanent Loss cause Ray is much more volatile than a Stable Coin USDC   So it s up to u and ur business plan  If u wanna maximize ur gains u go with farming risking to get hit by IL  IF u wanna get some safe passive income u go with staking full nodes vs validators are different  so it matters whether you re talking about eth vs eth2  The transparency report tells you exactly who has those coins  and it s all insiders  This is another huge weakness of this project  Honestly  the fact that they stopped doing the transparency reports in december and have not openly discussed the fact that the founders now have access to  2 5B USD worth of unlocked tokens is a HUGE red flag to me Weird flex Nope use Kraken  stake at 10 5 It  still Beta  so it s normal to have some Bugs   You didn t tell us what token are you Swapping so we can help you   That error   MIGHT   be solved by adding the token you re willing to Swap in your Phantom wallet first  it will cost you 0 002 SOL  then do the Swap again  that should be solved PS  make sure to have some SOL as gas in your Phantom wallet  0 001 SOL would be enough What s their discord channel DCA Great  thanks this is the kind of thing I was looking for Nope  use FTX  stake at 10 APR Surely there is an easy way to explain  maybe with a metaphor or something  Right now it really puts people off due to the complexity I think I heard it costs 3 4k in equipment which I guess is a lot better than other blockchains This is what I was referring tohttps   www ethernodes org Maybe they are different to validators idk You just wrote faulty leader can stop whole network  That s not true  Network will skip one  400ms slot Cluster in Solana means all validator nodes GPU is used for hash acceleration  BPF is executed in userland currently and there are many ways to speed it up  Like execution in kernel Buy now and stake it  start to earn rewards 10   APY  The price will only go up and up and up I don t recommend Uphold with referral link  If you want to buy Sol on a

market dips   just compare Solanas chart with other coins  Also solanas dips have been fairly small  I don t think any of them have been over 10   I was looking for an entry point for quite a while and came late for a pretty substantial pump  After that I just said fuck it and went in  have not regretted it    gl Stuff about sharding seems to start at 41 54  Lots of other interesting stuff throughout Technicals got this thing pinned at  60 in 72 hrs  Just my personal analysis  and seen to strike well with this coin once staking SOL with you through SolFlare  do the rewards automatically collect into the staking wallet to grow  or is there a manual action required on my part very well put  blockchain should be agnostic and Sam guy has too many libetard moves for my liking the world cares because it affects them in the long term  We all affect each other but US specially Just wondering  for now  all the fees are received are burned This means that the network sustain the validators through inflation Does Solana have a treasury system  or is there a plan to implement one in the near future same like if the internet is down then bitcoin blockchain is shut downDoesn t happen right  Same is with Solana That s so true  I did a transaction the other day on Solana blockchain and the transaction was confirmed under 10 seconds for just a few cents  Not even a whole  1 Not CoinTracking  however they said it might be included in their top 15 supported chains objectives Just imagine what would happen if all the DeFi platforms on Ethereum migrate to Solana Ecosystem Thanks  these are interesting points to think about  PoW attack by a large pool in China is impossible because all of their miners are incompatible  that s why algo was different for Kadena and only was possible to mine on GPU before the first ASICS were produced for its support  There is no existing pool or enough devices to attack the network  And all produced ASICs will of course be used for KDA mining from the moment they re purchased  Staking on Solana will be not profitable  as I said  one of the two  either exorbitant gas fees are required to feed all the  stakers   or it just won t work  stakes will be withdrawn  sold or staked for DeFi with higher yields  What will be the motivation to stake if the Solana rewards will be like 3 4  for example  While in DeFi loans you get between 6  to 10  easily   even if loans will on average end up being 5 6  and staking SOL for securing network yields 3   who will keep staking long term This is the first case i see someone go though this    ERC20 From Sollet to Binance Smart chain    Sollet io  https   Sollet io  have the WormHole bridge that is run by Serum  you should join  Serum Discord  https   discord gg EDvudv6  for support about that  it there is a way to get your funds back  they won t let you down use a vpn  you can      eth_decentralized      Commands   opt out    delete You can use a VPN Don t look for a dip  It could never happen at these prices  This is a project that should be competing with polkadot or Cardano in market value If you have a five year view  which I think is a very healthy approach  then today s price is probably not that important to you Can you elaborate on flexible VMs Yeah that fire caused the top staked validator  Chorus One  to go down for over 9 hours   I think it was close to 12 hours by the end   That s just ridiculous that a validator with 13 million stake didn t have or couldn t execute a backup plan in the event of data center disaster   It s why I tell people that staking with the biggest is no more guarantee of reliability than staking with smaller validators Try Exodus  first buy usdt  transfer it to your Exodus wallet and inside Exodus change it to Sol I also have around 9 mil in erc20 and am waiting for the wormhole Do we know that the erc20 tokens are not already counted in the total released supply  If so please tell me how you obtained this information  My understanding is that they have 10trillion max supply    Since people can migrate the coins i would assume all the released coins are accounted for from all block chains regardless of coin type in the current released supply   I ve done no studying on this just looking for some to do Metamask conversion works as does transferring BTC   ETH to CoinEx and exchanging to SOL on there then  optionally  transferring off to Sollet Another downside is it does not have anywhere near the level of network effect benefits that ETH has   Its not always the case that the best or fastest tech wins out   Sometimes the biggest barriers are just the momentum the entrenched interests  ETH possibly  have I hadn t heard about those validators going down  but I did hear about that data center fire  or maybe we re talking about two separate incidents  but regardless  which is what made me think about this actually  Good information  thanks 8 have tried it and the best solution for me  was to send sol on raydium to exchange it to usdc You can choose among various nodes if you stake on Moonlet  nice iPhone app   However  they do try to route you into their own node  which does have a nice low fee  at 5  vs  7 10  for most other validators   and it takes some work to navigate the app so as to stake to a different node  Also  it doesn t seem to have all the nodes you might want to stake to listed I was looking at P2P  but there s so many people delegating there  seems like we should spread the love a bit  Unfortunately  all my attempted delegations so far seem to just sit at  inactive  indefinitely The foundation started putting a limit on the number of validators that can exist in a data center that they will provide stake to  the solana foundation provides stake to keep a lot of small validator operators going    This was in response to an incident maybe two months ago where the Hetzner data center in Europe had an outage and like 1 5 of the Solana validators were taken out all at once   They learned their lesson  started applying pressure through taking stake away from data centers that had too many validators  and naturally validators took the hint and redistributed However  they appear to have stayed with Hetzner  but to have split themselves into a Helsinki group and a Falkenstein  Germany  group   It s still 23  of the overall stake in those two data centers   Not ideal  I agree A big issue is that the foundation cannot provide stake for any US based entity due to US security laws that they either haven t had the will or time to find a way around   So alot of the small validators  staked with foundation stake  ended up choosing data centers in their home turf of Europe   I ve heard that those are also the cheapest  so maybe anyone anywhere would have chosen them  but I like to think that if US entities could get foundation stake  that there would be a lot more validators scattered across the US My validator is in a data center with no other Solana validators  so I m trying to do my part for datacenter decentralization Some of the solana rpc nodes  nodes that communicate with the chain  that apps like raydium use in conjunction with their smart contracts  were getting bogged down I m not sure   Some services have been built relying on the Solana Foundation s RPC nodes that really should have been built with their own nodes to ensure their own use does not run into limits of Solana s systems   I don t know if Raydium  Serum  and other services were running their own nodes that bogged down or if they were relying on Solana s No excuses though   The entire ecosystem should have been built to better withstand these use cases  it just grew maybe a little faster than they were expecting   But still  I think they have learned their lesson   I heard alot of talk on the Solana Discord at the end of last week about how RPC nodes had been overloaded and there was a scramble to put extra ones in place The Solana Foundation just added rate limiting to their own RPC nodes  which pretty much means that other services  have to  start running their own instead of relying on Solana s  if only to ensure that they don t run into rate limit during periods of high activity   I think this is a wise choice    allowing lots of services to by default just use the Solana s nodes without creating their own redundant nodes was a bit of a recipe for trouble and it appears to have bit them Probably has to do with the high exchange volume lately with all the chatter about the next surge for the more affordable coins  Especially with the crypto world growing exponentially daily A lot of time and research  Polkadot has some potential problems with how they handle governance and security with their protocol  Cosmos network is superior in how it handles those two topics specifically  DOT has some other advantages over Cosmos  but I personally see the two I listed as bigger issues than the advantages they offer  I could be wrong though  this is just my opinion Personally  I don t think ETH is going anywhere  I don t think other layer 1 blockchains will  kill  eth at all  But I do think there is a lot of opportunity for competitors to rise up in the space People think ADA or DOT will compete with Eth  Personally I think Solana has a better chance  I also think Elrond will carve itself out a nice slice of the Defi market share in the future  But again  this is just a guess based on the research I ve done Even Binance US  We can t use regular Binance in my state  But Binance US does full ID verification for the IRS  so it s legal in my state This is it   Thank you so much So far FTX and Ascendex accept both USDC and USDT SPL that I know of Downside of Solana is that it is very technical and complex  all these innovative solutions come with a technical cost Have you previously staked your SOL in exodus If yes  you ll need to unstake it and wait for 2 days before you can exchange When can solana do the same smh  ‍ ️ gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them Chia has alot more functionalities no blockchain even thinks of  especially when it comes to cross border payments  even said they will compete with Swift or Swift will be forced to use there tech  The team behind Chia far exceed any crypto team 1  Bram Cohen created Bittorent  best network

Former CEO of overstock com   CFO for Razer  amp  CFO at skullcandy The reason it grinds my gears as to why people compare apples to oranges  and I own Solana is just a bunch of nerds that don t ever consider the actual business usecases To me I look at Solana s team and yeah it looks great  there experiences are within the top tech companies of the world  but I still feel like Chia has the advantage over solana by creating really revolutionizing technology decades ago that are still relevant today  Solana has to prove alot in my eye s  the team have worked at high positions at top tech companies  but not many created there own to become really world changing tech like Bittorent  at one stage 80  of the entire world s data was flowing through there in the early 2000 s  I see it as the original and first decentralized network ever on the internet  amp  x200B Apples to oranges  Solana has really great tech  Chia is built for business use and have that already in motion  They will be going public on the Nasdaq in 6 12 months which says they have NDA s in place that will represent revenue streams that relate to a high market valuation  otherwise they wouldn t go public so quick

Rocket_Emoji_ F0 9F 9A 80 utm_source extlink I need to look into the history of cryptokitties more  never thought I d use that sentence     They mentioned it in the podcast and I just did a brief overview of what it was  now I have something to fill my night ahaha gt  There s probably a pretty good chance there are niche products that can be built on all of them  Totally  The fact that CryptoKitties crashed a network that is mostly being used for finance is hilarious  So many apps like this will be moving to something that can handle the transactions     Which will really start getting people s attention when they start comparing tx speeds and fees I am using P2P    Mostly because I using them on Tezos with no issue    No issue so far on SOL Lol true  I guess they re going to happen anyway  At least the scammers would have to rewrite the programs in Rust instead of copy pasting from Solidity on the Eth blockchain right Absolutely  I haven t done nearly enough research on eth2 0 but from what I ve heard it s just a giant question mark that s holding everything back  But either way  I don t see a problem with holding ethereum and all of its  killers  lol  There s probably a pretty good chance there are niche products that can be built on all of them  Once again tho I m no expert There 16 DEFI projects    you can check it out  from here    https   solana com ecosystem  https   solana com ecosystem Saw a talk between Anatoly and the CEO of near  I dig A s style  I ll check it out ETH2 0 is such a question mark in my mind as to the actual speeds and release date Yea  that s where I was finding it  This does bring up an interesting point though in how many of these validators are in the same datacenters  In one of these threads the other day you were talking about the difficulty of attacking the network because of several reasons  one of them being the geographic spread of the validators  When I was reading it I was thinking of this though cuz I remember a lot of them being in the same datacenters  If I recall there are a lot in Helsinki for instance  but don t quote me on that  Regardless  I wouldn t say it s exactly ideal These are great questions  Check out the discord channel  and definitely ask a lot of those questions on there  I ll answer 3  6  and 7 for the sake of time  3  The mainnet is still in beta  and there has been a network halt  back in December if I recall   It was a few hours  it was quickly resolved and the validators quickly adopted the patch  It s a young net  but a lot of work has been done to prevent one in the future 6  right now  you can get a great validator up and running for a few thousand  comparable or less than most chains I ve seen  The machines will need to get better over time  and those will be expensive  but the rewards should compensate  especially at this velocity  I think that there is always a fear of centralization when you need good hardware and bandwidth to avoid being delinquent  However  with each Epoch s leader election  it likely won t become too centralized  7  speed cheap definitely perks  Being able to do everything on chain without another layer is also awesome   The flexible VMs for the smart contracts are also a huge perk IHMO If you want to find out where a Validator is  even without them telling you on their web site  check out validators app    you can find a validator  search by name or use their list   and click on the details  and from there you can find out what data center it is in I personally do not advertise the data center of my validator on my website because I thought it might be safer that way  but since validators app shows it anyway  I guess there s no harm in putting it there I m not much into web site design though so my validator web site is kind of laughable   I intend to fix that sometime soon The block chain is running just fine   The problem lies in the systems that shuttle transactions to the block chain and back again on behalf of the users   Those are called RPC nodes and some services were built without properly load balancing across RPC nodes  causing some backup on certain ones The RPC nodes are part of the larger Solana ecosystem  so you could say that Solana backed up  but again it was due to some poor load balancing  not to a fundamental problem with the network   If you used properly load balanced RPC nodes  the block chain was as fast as ever  not that you get a choice as a user of Solflare  Raydium  etc   they set up their own RPC load balancing that is beyond your control and was the root of the problem Correct me if I am wrong but I think sending usdc or usdt to your Solana wallet is much more expensive than swapping the same Solana on raydium for usdt c  It s what I did and avoided 26  in fees I just looked into adding a node for the network  the hardware requirements are  just not practical What is a realistic price eoy Feel free to ask me any questions Is it blocked from the US still thanks but i   think   i was wrong about the hard cap  looks like there s a 1 5  inflation rate built in over time    question is do the fees outweigh the introduction of new sol on the testnet yes absolutely Crypto com doesn t work in NY either  We have Coinbase and Bitrue I m in NY too and it s tough bro  Exchange for it in Exodus Wallet  That s how I get it I did exactly that at 45 3 a few hours ago yes Binance US works for me in North Carolina  Maybe try that Radium does seem very sketchy and I ve had experience of being scammed by an anonymous founder before  Definitely makes me cautious and it will be the same for other investors  hence why I don t expect radium to perform too well Solflare What are you talking about Cardano has 2000  stake pools and is fully decentralized Those are the validator nodes  right  Or am I completely clueless about how a PoS network works Don t look for entry point  just enter  Buy and HODL healthy debate is good as it is the natural process for strengthening the idea of the network in the free market  eventually people will come to consider the promise of solana   slowly  then suddenly you re absolutely right  there is an inflation rate i shouldve dug a little deeper  from my understanding it seems theres a lot going towards  incentivizing new nodes  https   solana com staking inflationrate   does this mean that sol is perpetually growing at 1 5  inflation i want to clarify my previous comment  cardano has validators  even if its hard to find information on them ie how many there are pls refer me info if you know   it cannot be compared to ethereum or bsc or solana bc it does not have  dapps like DEXs  borrow lending  games  nft platforms etc ETH2 0 is already running  the beacon chain   A quick merge is actually doable in a month and was discussed when the POW miners were acting up   There s a ton of scaling solutions on L2  a lot of them already working and offering similar performance  and cost  to Solana  Don t get blinded by partisanship and some idiot s take on ETH based on 2017 Bitcoin maxi arguments Bringing up CryptoKitties  2017  in 2021 is disingenuous    Also  the single small IDO of MEDIA brought down the whole Raydium ecosystem  Yes  that s not the blockchain   But on the blockchain side  there s this  400ms finality  in the headline  That also increased by 4x  with that single IDO and with the frontends failing  If the frontends had worked  what would ve happened to the chain   Lastly  the floor on the number of validators is consistently increasing  The more validators  the more issues you will run into in regards to scaling  It s easy to do 100k TX on a small cluster of well connected machines   Don t fall for the marketing  understand what s going on  Optimistic concurrency has downsides as soon as you have a few very hot write targets I already took the dive  You ll do fine The answer is  right now I m going in   Wish me luck Thank you Indeed   It was fun for awhile to manually compound on Raydium 2x per day  but the shine is starting to wear off Haha yes it is FTx com My 2 day  cooldown  finally expired and yesterday or the day before I started delegating to my pool   Status is now  activating  so I believe I m waiting for this epoch to end   Then next epoch you re in and after that one ends you get rewards     I think it s a total of 2 days cooldown    1 to 5 days  for current epoch to finish   then 5 days for the epoch you re in to end for first rewards so a total waiting period of anywhere from 8 12 days By my logic and understanding you ll have rewards within the next 4 days maximum friend Source     https   twitter com solana status 1389315751580880896  https   twitter com solana status 1389315751580880896   1    Hackathon

entities add up to 33   which is as bad as the PoW counterparts   Eth1 it takes 3 to get to 51  and BTC takes 6  This has been disappointing for improving the Nakamoto Coefficient  a measure of censorship resistance     It would take the top 15 nodes currently to halt the solana network  see solanabeach io   So I would say solana is more decentralized than ETH  ETH 2 0 and BTC Iunno man iunno Max supply is not decreasing over time  it is increasing due to the 8  per year  decreasing by 15  per year  inflation  Eventually burns may outpace the inflation  especially once it caps out at 1 5  in the future  Total supply on Jan 14th was 488 5 million  Now it s 494 5 million That s ridiculous  Cardano is the mainnet  It just doesn t have any features yet I m not seeing anything yet after 8 days of delegating  So  feeling really curious now     I m getting daily rewards from some SOLs I ve staked in Binance  but nothing yet from solarflare  How about you  Have you managed to stake your SOL Good question  I m looking forward to the answers Polkadot and Cardano were my conservative benchmark  Yes  I think they can capture Binance market share  Most of devs that use binance do it because of the convenience despite being a centralized project https   docs projectserum com staking about staking  https   docs projectserum com staking about staking Check out Marinade Finance Thanks alot  May I know if I have a project on Solana  how willl it be shown to the mass liike this by Solana They are anonymous  scroll to the bottom of https   raydium io info  for a blurb about each team member Reading and understanding stuff is important prior to putting your money in The band  amp  the music looks amazing man  good luck to you all We ll wait for an update when you guys have that new album released If it s money you may need you should not be staking it  I share the inconvenience but staking does introduce illiquidity This   Raydium io  https   Raydium io  gave me a whole new appreciation for the Solana ecosystem  and enjoyment  SolFlare  which I was using given Ledger integration  drove me absolutely insane  It is so buggy and barely usable  Shameful Here is the

that development and upgrade is another real important aspect of decentralization Follow this account for example   https   twitter com Solana _Mates  https   twitter com Solana_Mates Thanks Awesome Where do you guys find these projects  I don t find their websites in google does Aurory have a website  I can t find this game SolFlare and Exodus Can exchange for it in Exodus Wallet  I m in NY and that s how I ve gotten mine I bough ZIL until I found out about Solana and Near  Protocol do any of these apps allow a connection via wallet connect All good bruv i m all in  thanks guys IMO should be competing with binance  Devs are FLOCKING to solana  Look at the twitter I think I ve been buying from  15 all the way up to it s latest peak  Just buy and hodl thanks sir  how i can get solstarter yes my mistake  i was looking for max supply True  I really wanted to move some of my SOL to ADA for its growth potential  I am a Hodler at heart and I am just looking to take a bit of profit  in eth  and also get a minimum of ADA going just incase they explode as well This must have been what happened  Thank you for the reply in your post you said you couldn t find a total supply for sol on cmc  amp  now you found it  max supply is defined  amp  actually decreasing over time as a   of fees go towards a burn  I think 50  of fees but don t quote me on that I ve bought already and have started staking Sol on Moonlet I m kind of the other way around   bought a ton of ZIL first  only now getting into SOL I was looking at max supply in coinmarketcap   https   coinmarketcap com currencies solana    Indeed total supply is 494 5M  But generally most of the coins mention a max supply if its defined  like case of bitcoin or cardano or xrp aka ambition You can see the TPS on the solana explorer  It was sitting around 1500 TPS the morning of the IDO  Far below max volume  Solana was fine  raydium s frontend servers couldn t handle the pressure Buy on Coinex  Transfer to sollet  Live in NY  just did it yesterday  Was also able to pick up RAY on Coinex as well  No KYC  everything transferred off Coinex into Sollet same day Yeah  SOL hasn t been seeing big dips at all  and it often actually goes up when the rest of the market sees a correction  Lately  any time it dips below the 7 day MA has been a decent time to buy  Waiting for a huge dip at this point is kind of a fool s errand imo No  simply stating their vision and the path they are using to try to make it reality if we are judging projects off of ambitions alone  the crypto market should be worth  10T at least Yes we ll see  They aim more strictly at being a decentralized government  So on that vision  having a fully decentralized governance model is necessary upfront when dealing with government if you want users and government trust no theres a difference between very little and none  huge difference actually  but sure  lets judge cardano on what it might do in 2023  see you guys then    amp  like i said in my original response  decentralization is not a binary  there is no  fully  decentralized it s just more or less decentralized  could cardano be more decentralized if everyone was running a node on an iphone  sure absolutely ZERO  they dont have a mainnet how could they have validators Fully decentralized  Some people complain about the fact they have very little smart contracts deployed  which is totally true  but I think they used a different path to build than most of its competitors  It will be easier to judge in 2 3 years from now I m seriously considering it Cardano has 0 main net validators Thanks  I m looking for something that not only helps me calculate gains and losses for tax purposes  but helps me track the value of my portfolio over time  Step doesn t do any of that just yet  Also  I m looking for something that lets me do it for my entire portfolio  not   just   Solana wallets An important point about yield farming is that both the STEP and the USDC you have in the pool are vulnerable to price movements in STEP  So if STEP goes down in value from when you put the money in  you get fewer USDC when you withdraw from the pool  If STEP goes up  on the other hand  you get more USDC when you withdraw from the pool than you put in  Basically  then  you should only yield farm if  a  you think you can get out higher than you got in or  b  you think the APR you make in the meanwhile will compensate you for a downward price movement in STEP   b  is much less likely than you might think  even with a gigantic APR  cause the APR is all in STEP and so you are very much exposed to its price movements through and through  All of the above might be incorrect   perhaps others can say if it is  In any case the above is not financial advice  use at your own risk  and make sure to do your own research on impermanent loss and yield farming CHALLENGE FOR YOU GUYS  INCLUDE ELROND IN THIS CHART  AND THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT We will  Possibly 1 more test of sub 40 Depends on the entire crypto market  It can t get to  1000 with btc at 55k and eth at 3k Coinex Yes   I heard about it like a week ago and bought immediately at 42   Glad I didn t wait Not yet but thinking it might be my next move hell yeah nerve Did you do this  How much did you lose in gas fees  I m in NY and have SOL on Hotbit but the exchange is trash and currently down do to a  hack  but it was always down before the hack so looking for another way to purchase it so I can get off Hotbit forver usually its not even a whole cent lmfao I bought when it peaked  _  in the red still I love being able to stake from my Ledger on Solflare Bro     bro     don t wet the flame   FAN THE FLAME    Solana 10K by December  Jkjk Nop realistic price is  400 gt well I ll be using the profits from my SOL to cover upfront costs for our album release later in the year in the spirit of solana  why not launch the album on Audius Solana is just starting to get the attention it deserves   several friends of mine who are far more knowledgeable and experienced in the crypto space are excited about Solana  It s just starting to gain some  brand  recognition   so much potential and many early stage projects  But I agree  it has some stiff competition at the moment Today i am selling Half of my BTC Bag  for buy SOL    The Performance of SOL is just outstanding    I cant believe is so cheap right now Well  it just went live in Beta Interesting  I m curious why they allowed other services to use Solana s nodes by default  given the fact that it seems that from Solana s inception  they aimed to acquire massive migration and integration with their blockchain I m still figuring out Discord  There are so many different information streams these days its hard for me to keep up If they get their shit together it would be a fine option  especially when  assuming they do  and I don t know why they wouldn t  Trezor offers support for SOL  However  when liquid staking comes online  that s where I ll be moving mine Yeah  I agree  I haven t had any issues staking with them  but I have had an exchange that got tied up for a week with no response from support  It was a convenient way to get started staking SOL  but I m starting to get worried about having all my eggs in one basket if I keep staking more with them I staked it in Exodus wallet yes in non tech terms it was the front end facing clients that got overloaded with too much traffic  the chain was fine you should hop in the serum discord for a quicker response  here  https   discord gg hWRCqbc9 also keep in mind that the network considers each vote on a block to be a transaction i use solflare to stake  very easy to do once you play around with it a little they re anonymous Don t help this guy he s a troll decentralization is a spectrum its not a binary where 0   not and 1   sufficiently decentralized    btc is obviously the most decentralized due to the combination of being the most popular most nodes longest running  dissemination of supply  and ease of running a node with a simple raspberry pi   cardano has 0 mainnet validators  so thats out of the question until they deliver an actual product   amp  x200B ethereum hardware requirements arent as demanding as solana s but consider the other tradeoff  32eth which at 3k per eth you re looking at  96k vs anywhere from 2 10k to get a sufficient rig set up where you have 0 minimum stake requirements   amp  x200B consider ethereum s pre mine where 12 million ETH were created for the developers  and 60 millionETH were premined for ICO participants to buy  i think it turned out to be like over 65  of the total ethereum supply   as for the token sale of solana  excluding the validator sale and allocation to the founders and validators  there was about 32 67  sold to investors according to binance research  most of these tokens unlocked jan 7th 2021 and the price has massively increased since then  im biased to sol and acknowledge that these investors will probably dump  but it seems at least some of them believe in the network as over 60  of the circulating supply is currently staked      not sure where you don t see a total supply    according to  solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io  there s a total supply of 494 5M SOL and a circulating supply of 272 6M SOL https   youtu be wgOVsD5dUoI   goes by aplharay  this is an interview wirg him and founder of Solana I m staking it with Ray and Srm on raydium swap I believe I ve seen this question before   From what I recall in that thread  It seems they place a high value on their anonymity Lol if sol hits  1k I will buy you all a sandwich That s what I said   Thanks I guess  Haha lol Me too   A search for Solana on Twitter just yields a bunch of spam for  Holdana  smh Yea  I m aware of all of that  You don t need to unstake to add more stake though is my point  And since I initially replied I tried a couple more times and it went through  confirming that you don t need to unstake  As to what the issue was the other 10 times or whatever I tried  who knows Also in the interests of transparency we did have a second day of rehearsal yesterday  but clearly our mojo wasn t as strong then In Exodus  go to your portfolio  click Solana   or go to your wallet  search for Solana  amp  x200B Click  Earn rewards 10 52   at top left   or click  View earnings  next to the amount staked  amp  x200B You ll then see 3 options  Overview    Stake   and  Unstake It says unstaking takes about 2 days Not serious about sponsorship btw  we re doing fine  If all goes well I ll be using the profits from my SOL to cover upfront costs for our album release later in the year  No more embarrassing crowdfunder videos   Here s the band  https   www solana uk   in case anyones interested It s that possible

solana comments n4qi0b star_atlas_launching_on_solana_reupload_with    I should probably remove this post soon but I want to let you know about the new thread first  Maybe some mods will act on the double thread   I ve never experienced this before cant hear youm9 you need a louder microphone Please help a noob  How does a game build on Solana  Is there an in game marketplace  or is it part of the gameplay somehow gt https   docs projectserum com staking about stakingthanks for this  didn t realize there was a whole website SRY about the lack of sound   I m reuploading this titled  Star Atlas launching on Solana Damn  should I reupload  I have no sound either https   youtu be l27QN3NmomA t 852 I used Coinex  no KYC  Bought SOL with BTC and was able to transfer it to my sollet same day  Any questions lmk  also used it to buy RAY Feel like I shouldve been able to figure this out  but how do I get sound  I m using a desktop browser and see no option no sound Marinade is not live yet  although they claim they will adjust the stake to produce the best APY This is the content that should be flooding the subreddit  Not a buncha neon pictures screaming all the tps numbers at you Sollet io There will be space for both and probably both will work together  Whenever this space gets into 20Trillions etc you think there s only going to be space for one L1 Yeah Star Atlas is gonna be big Is solana in binance platform When launch Lol  you are welcome Who has the highest SOL  APY   Marinade or Exodus  Thanks solana is built from scratch  is newer  and has smart contracts eth 2 0 will never be faster then the current solana let alone solana in few years if you have to ask  probably not  if you like ethereum  i dont see why you wouldnt thats exactly it  professional validators secure multiple blockchains they re not  owned by insiders    it is true that the Solana Foundation offers grants and delegates SOL to people who KYC with them to help jumpstart their node  but anyone can join with no minimum stake required reminder that there s no such thing as  fully decentralized  what happens if you get 10 million validators  well there 7 billion people on the planet what about them I m really happy I m not high because that music would have scared the shit out of me haha  Cool band  Weird timing and beats  medley of instruments  good video quality  I like it also see  this  https   twitter com search q  40projectserum 3A 20burn amp src typed_query Seed Sale   tokens comprise 16 23  of the total token supply     Founding Sale   tokens comprise 12 92  of the total token

token supply got that from  here  https   research binance com en projects solana all that adds up to about 61   an arbitrary distinction but i wouldnt consider the validator sale or the foundation and community allocations to be insider tokens   im not trying to ignore the obvious centralized aspects to Solana  im simply trying to demonstrate that no project is perfect and there are always tradeoffs   for a regular person somewhere in the midwest  it s way easier to join the solana network with a decent investment into computer hardware than it is to join the ethereum community as a full node with 32eth Im new  Pls explain what you meant  Im also interested in  holding this long term  What do you mean by bear market ahh you re absolutely right   shelley hard fork is the mainnet  i stand corrected    the overall point still stands that cardano is a GHOST CHAIN with no development     more on par with doge or xrp than ethereum or bsc 10k per day  I transferred BTC to buy SOL  Then sent SOL to my sollet interesting monetary policy That IF eth is faster is doing a lot of work  Solana would have to build out such a better ecosystem that users migrated in face of the speed disadvantage  That is highly unlikely  Sol would be sunk this settle thing also got me at first using Raydium  DGood times when you panic but notice that nothing is away Anything under  50 is a bargain  I fucked up and did not buy when it was  2  So anything under  50 is totally a buy  And holding for 10 years What are the limits without KYC That s an option too   I was avoiding the VPN because I will never be able to KYC because my documents say I live in NY   So what are the limits for withdrawal on FTX without KYC I have plenty of experience with serum and never lost a penny  Have you tried the trading tab on raydium io  I think it uses the bonfida dex interface  it s the best I ve used  They recently added more RPC servers due to increases in traffic  which made the experience much smoother  If you have issues  please report them to the serum discord page Most of them seem to be independent validators that validate a ton of different projects  Can you explain What is the best coin used to exchange for Sol Eth 2 0 does not intend to be faster than Solana Go to the market in the Solflare DEX  You ll see a button called  Settle  next to USDT  Click on it na this time I will be patient  I wanna do this shit for a long term  So it must be a good price  I hope this week I m gonna do it we can see the transaction from my address     8 SOL  to this new address   8 SOL   https   explorer solana com address BJ41vdNSohvLZwRy9ZTtkS1UqDANEgDmmWHTXzSPa2Aj  https   explorer solana com address BJ41vdNSohvLZwRy9ZTtkS1UqDANEgDmmWHTXzSPa2Aj whithout USDT credit on my token account gt Have you settled the funds after the transaction NO sir Composability  Eth 2 0 at scale will be sharded chains  which makes it difficult for smart contracts to interact with each other  Solana is a single chain architecture  enabling composable dapps  which is perfect for DeFi You can buy SOL on   binance us One of the easiest and cheapest ways is to use a VPN and buy it on FTX us   First  sign into VPN  Create an account on FTX us  Create a Coinbase account  if you don t already have one   Buy BTC on Coinbase  Send BTC from Coinbase to FTX us wallet  Use BTC to swap or buy SOL on FTX us Have you settled the funds after the transaction I sent Sol over 17 hours ago to Binance  US and the transaction not showing up  Transaction not found in the Solana Explorer A chain without transactions can offer tiny to none fees  I remember BTC without fees You need a better metric    byte written into the chain would be better  but still inaccurate I been reading the different comments under this post  so my question is  is it worth investing in Solana or not Now or never You missed it at 43 I love Step Finance Raydium looks as clean as a freshly shaved fanny mate and works as smoothly as one as well  Definitely recommend giving her a throw around I 2nd this  Raydium is very smooth  fast and cheap  I just hate having so many wallets all over the shop now lol I ve been using FTX US specifically for buying SOL since it isn t available on Crypto com for US customers Haha  who needs a meme coin when you can own some Charizard  Did you end up getting some  It s a bit complicated to get because it only just came out you re talking about ethereums pre mine  but ignoring the fact that with SOL  more than 60  of the total supply is owned by insiders of solana  according to their own data  Additionally   80  of the reported float currently is owned by insiders In Washington and New York  there are special regulations Yeah it has definitely potential  But eth level idk  But I want to invest in solana to  Just waiting for a dip the real problem is that I think a majority of those top 15 nodes are all owned by insiders What wallet are you using you have many posts about this regards  just scroll it down through subbredit any you will find well argued arguments I have made many trades on Serum Dex  as well as on Raydioum  no problem at all for now  UX is not the best  but still I m giving them credit for what day did in a short amount of time No problems here    staking all Solana What will be the size growth per day  at 50k TPS in the future  Assuming 1kb per transaction  as a rough example  I ended up with this calculation for disk size growth   50000   86400    1024   1024  which is  4 3TB a day https   www cnbc com 2021 03 26 crypto industry to get first major us stadium with miami dade county approving ftx for heat home html  https   www cnbc com 2021 03 26 crypto industry to get first major us stadium with miami dade county approving ftx for heat home html from all current projects I like Kadena PoW and multi chain approach more  seems the most decentralized with highest possible TPS in a PoW mode  they are really bad in terms of developing their dev community though  but maybe they re just not ready yet to dedicate enough time    Elrond  Polka  Solana  Avalanche  EOS  Cardano  all feel the same to me  same problems from different angle  Why would PoS fans use any of these alternatives when Eth 2 0 is almost there  and it already has all the dApps  devs  and ecosystem   Why do we need more of the same  PoS flavors What makes you so confident about it No idea about that tbh  but one thing for sure  that the coming version s  will be much more easier  less complicated than we see right now  For example we have Phantom is doing great progress so far to be the  1 wallet for Solana  even sending your SPL token now can be done using your receiving SOL address only which is a good progress Buying Solana and Cardano in small  100 amounts because I just can t afford the fees with BTC ETH and ETH TOKENS to transfer to an external wallet  or exchange when prices start falling  I think this is going to be a major factor as people like me get into this strange and beautiful world we call crypto Oh thanks alot mate  Sincerely appreciated  In that case there will be no future proof solution for the time being if there is any new derivation path in the near future right Saw it now  It s quite intuitive that they auto compound to get USDC STEP LP for you instead of the same pool on Raydium  it gives you Step tokens as rewards It s real  Can t take the APY   APR 100  but it s like a ball park thanks for explanation  it makes a lot of sense actually    But what are the archiver nodes  who will pay for all the storage amount  It s quite expensive to store 4 5TB a day of data  if it ll grow let s say at 50TPS rate then 150TB a month approximately  someone needs to pay all that storage Short answer   I believe in Anatoly when he talks about the difficulties complexities which arise through sharding  I think devs want a solution now   not potentially later  Serum etc will not move off solana if it works  which it does in spades  Eth 2 0 is shutting the door after the horse has bolted Binance i couldnt buy in the uk    I ended up buying on gate io probably for dApps to run on it  since it s fast  and Rust coding is familiar for many and not so esoteric  as is the C C    so my overall feeling is positive FTX is a centralized exchange it doesn t use Solana Thankfully FTX  non US  is amazing and that runs off of solana    so I have faith in the coin   But yeah  we need some better apps imagine the size of this blockchain eventually after all these promised transactions really start running on the network  Let s take the baseline of 50k  ignoring the fact mainnet right now does 1k for some reason as if there is no more demand   and 1kb of data per transaction  in reality it s much much more but let s be conservative and think that it s all super optimized and compressed in storage    so at 50k TPS we re looking at 4320000000 transactions a day  Which is 4 3 terabyte of data PER DAY   Now tell me starting from that point  how this blockchain will be operating in the future Cheapest fees I know of  are in one of the PoW chains actually  which is surprising  I won t say the name so people won t think I m shilling it  but it s about 0 00000001 0 0000001 range  in     and no the miners don t care about the fees since it s not their primary income  they just mine as usual for the distribution of the inflationary token  which is a proven working model and I don t think any innovation is required there is Eth 2 0 about to be even faster finality than 400ms   O well the dev ecosystem is not something that will go away so all projects which gained adoption now and have dapps built on them  will stay long term  Like all linux distro flavors     they all are more or less the same with a different taste Not Interested on what you are selling  Ty I had a similar situation  It turned out that my Metamask was glitching and thought that it had made transactions  but it had actually not sent them to the Ethereum network  which was why I couldn t see them on Etherscan The solution ended up being to click on the round account icon and go into Metamask settings  gt  Advanced  gt  Reset Account  This clears any local transactions from Metamask without resetting the wallet itself  ie you don t need to re enter your seed phrase   And since the transactions were only local for me  they got cleared and my wallet was usable again  https   www reddit com r Metamask comments i7pwvy contract _interaction _pending _stuck _here _for _12 g13c0bu utm _source share amp utm

Solana s fees significantly cheaper Long hold  dips only give me opportunities to accumulate more  It ll be at ETH levels one day Crypto com I am heavily invested in Solana  So I am not here to troll  but I would like to ask you a question  If Ethereum has the support of the corporate backers and 2 0 ends up being faster than Solana  what competitive advantage is SOL left with  Btw I agree with your original thread No  Go to adapools website and browse through all the stake pools available  They are on the mainnet I have ADA and I can stake to any of them Validators are used to validate blocks and transactions for the blockchain which is live on the mainnet for a while now Research before you claim stuff like that in public  It only makes you look rediculous 40bn cap at current supply   so a 3 5X is my prediction dude you do realize that asking whether you should buy on this sub is like asking whether it s ok to smoke in a smoking lounge Oh sorry  I misread the question So you hodl thro bear market  Are you new Hey  just wondering why you think Solana is too centralized because imo its honestly very well decentralized TBH  Because of political connections to people in power Read  https   www reddit com r solana comments n0hyad a_summary_of_solana_the_tech_and_why_it_is_the  utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmfMainly the spead and the fact there is no sharding  Just a super fast scale one Well ATM  prices keep going up and up and up  hence bull market  Bear market means prices don t typically go up a whole lot if any gt ball parkan area or range within which an amount or estimate is likely to be correct  we can make a pretty good guess that this figure s in the ballpark Sounds cool  but how lol Where can i trade some ETH for SOL then transfer from that exchange too soflare or exodus if u have eth in a wallet  you can use the wormhole which is a bridge between ethereum and solana New to SOL    Can i swap ETH for SOL on Raydium  Then transfer too Exodus or SoFlare Cool  Must look into it  Just really struggling to find the time at the min The pools are much easier to navigate there in my opinion  I m currently in their new auto Cake pool with a 144 23  apy  I ve got a few LP tokens staked in a few of their farms as well I d recommend it  Kind of a pain in the ass to set up if you re in the US tho If there is one  I d like to know too Binance US is where I get mine Yea that is pretty strange  What are the liquidity pools etc like on pancake swap  any opportunity to make decent returns It s been connected  I had to remove liquidity from the pool  Once I did the dashboard updated my wallet balances  I did get some rewards it s odd that that was the only way for me to see them Binance US Why not prevent that by building it right into the code   that prevents any verifier of holding x amount of stake  PoW obviously can t have something like that in their code  but what s preventing something like that in PoS PoH chains Where can i trade some ETH for SOL then transfer from that exchange too Soflare or Exodus The Solflare UI is super super slow lately  wait a couple hours  and check back thanks   yeah   they need to be kept super small happening right now to me too  even with the add token function Same thing  Staking account with correct balance shows up on solanabeach  but Solflare still doesnt show the updated balance  Its been 3hrs I use Streamlabs OBS and I stream live on youtube  Might switch to Theta in the future Thanks bruh it s OC I m gonna try to make a few weekly This should be an NFT  D  Good share man Yep  But luckily rpc node upgrades are a lot easier to do than fixing a chain problem Yep it can get pretty intense at times   thanks dude Thank you  We re heading to the studio this weekend  album should be out near the end of the year  will keep you posted Cheers dude  Here s hoping Thank you  We re heading to the studio this weekend  album should be out near the end of the year  will keep you posted I added it to my sollet wallet   is there somewhere else to add it do you know where the  add token  function is It s on Twitter  this is the person who found out  https   twitter com CL207Solstarter even attempted to respond to the claims but they just can t justify the actions of those two team members Where do you find info like this Not at all   I get that it works  and I am intending to use it  As a developer though  I am hesitant to build mission critical applications  e g  a crypto company  on top of a  beta  My impression of Solana s 50k TPS is that this number was achieved under experimental conditions Actual TPS appears to be   700   https   explorer solana com   https   explorer solana com    I ve never seen it above 800 in the last month or so   I m not sure if this is because the platform isn t scaling up or demand isn t there  Given how flat it is   my expectation would be that the platform isn t scaling  if it was demand constrained  I d expect it to be a lot less even I want to say Matic  amp  Zillqa are in the thousands   but I can t find a dashboard offhand A couple of those working on Solstarter actually were outted a few days ago as repeated rugpullers with on chain proof  Personally  I m staying away MOONLET io is 11  I believe but you have to choose your stake pool Star Atlas is going to be huge  I m looking forward to Gaming NFTs more than anything I m getting a bag and holding for as long as possibly I love the project after digging into it more and watching numerous videos  You should take a look on the website at the eco system and backers and you will have a rough idea  One day they ll be saying  it s not too late to buy part of a  SOL Maybe the  Refresh Blockchain  option is only available on desktop version  I hope reinstalling the app works out for you Goto step finance and connect your wallet Yeah  but you need operations to go through  people don t trust software that throws random errors  especially when dealing with their hard earned money I think Solana has a chance  I m not saying I would bet on Solana winning  just that it has a chance  unlike other projects But I expect Solana to succeed at least to some degree I ve delegated using Solflare before and this did not happen Worked  Thank you Same here  hopefully things clear up soon Thanks  I refreshed the blockchain on desktop  but I don t see a way to do that in the mobile wallet  I think everything is fine  I just might need to reinstall the mobile app to get it to show the right total I staked some SOL more than two weeks ago on exodus  but I still didn t receive any reward  Does it takes so much Same here  I guess Solflare is having some backend problems  It shows my transaction  but not the staking account I m currently experiencing the same thing Dude are you using Media Network to broadcast FTX us  https   FTX us   Blockfolio or any of those Solana based Dexes that are enabled for the USA residents Check the     Settle     button  amp  click on it  you can find it under the      Wallet Balance      section If that doesn t work  disconnect your wallet  refresh the Raydium web page  amp  try again

have had problem of wrong balance and value of my SOL in exodus  solved by refreshing the blockchain  I use a desktop computer     On Solana page  click the 3 dots at top right corner  then click  Refresh Blockchain  from the drop down list   the 4th one from the top After it has finished  the balance and value are correct I posted this on exodus wallet subreddit  One member solved his problem by deleting the app and reinstalling  on mobile Thank you for the heads up I guess we can see some interesting new projects launching on Solana in the next few years    Correct me if I m wrong but the thing I really like about Solana compared to many other cryptos is Solana acts rather than talks  There are some very charismatic and well spoken personalities in the crypto space and I don t deny the importance of promotion but action always speaks louder than words  at least to me  Kudos please explain how your supposed model is not the exact antithesis of  decentralized   Who do you think sets up the very first nodes  and who do you think has all the solana to stake and has a very high vested interest in making sure the network is secure I just cancelled a buy order on  https   dex raydium io  https   dex raydium io  and my finds are missing  Any help on how to retrieve them TPS is like Internet speed in the early 2000s  It used to be the most important factor  but now the tech has evolved  and nobody really cares what the speed is because we re not running dial up anymore  TPS values aren t going to be the factor that determines the success of an ecosystem in the future  However  its important to understand that TPS is extremely relevant right now  I don t think eth is going anywhere  But I m also not a Eth maximalist  I believe there will be a variety of competitive platforms in the future  I personally see Solana taking a lot of the Dapp market share  and Elrond taking a lot of the defi market share in 5 years  But that s just my personal prediction Why invest in a POW architecture  when Eth is switching over to POS  Do you see much of a future for POW  If you think the only thing that makes Elrond or Solana special is TPS and POS  I suggest doing more research Serum DEX is no longer active    Radium uses Serum Thanks for confirming my numbers  but it s even simpler  https   solana com transparency report 2020 12 pdf total unlocked  435361717   SAFT  176 949 616 Employees and service providers  48 134 011  Founders  31 250 000 58   And of note  that s only half of the founders share  the other half is unlocking on a monthly basis  These are employees  founders  or contractual early investors  Unlikely that any of those sales were public in any sense  and all driven by relationships  which to me   insiders I use Exodus  They have 1 staking partner they work with  Everstake iirc   and you don t have to choose anything except the amount the stake and then press a button  I never had any issues until the past couple days  Now it fails when I try to add more in the desktop app  and I tried to stake some this morning and the desktop and mobile apps were giving me conflicting info about whether it succeeded Basically  I think the deal with anything in Exodus is that it s super easy until it isn t  The support response time is   gt  1 week  so there s definitely some risk of stuff getting tied up if their software glitches out  I m leaving my current stake in there  but my experience this morning has spooked me out of adding more anytime in the near future  Exchanging to SOL was kind of buggy this morning too Isn t zil immensely sharded  Could be wrong but I thought it was  That would be a nightmare for developing smart contracts that compose with each other Because they don t have a working on chain central limit order book  And since Serum has this I see any reason to use any other DEX I think a lot of the operation issues are from the rpc nodes  not the chain itself  I ve dealt with syncing issues once while trying to unstable my coins  but I tried again a few seconds later and it worked  I think that a trade off of the chain being so fast All in all I don t think solana will beat ethereum  however you define that  but if it can grab a slice of the pie and keep it  that will be an enormous win I don t get it  why you can t take your 100  earning from staking that pair  gt  it s like a ball park What does this mean  Sorry about my newbie question gt  blockchains like Zillqa  amp  Matic which have already launched their mainnets You re probably referring to Solana Mainet Beta as something that is not working as supposed to be lol  well  you re wrong about that  gt  but seem to have similar scale potential and even lower fees  Do they have PoH  do they have 400 ms block production  do they have 50k TPS  Are they using the Moore s Law for limitless scalability in the future I will be messaging you in 14 days on    2021 05 18 19 38 20 UTC    http   www wolframalpha com input  i 2021 05 18 2019

remindme  2 weeks let s make it with SOLANA  greatest project that i ever heard  If we can transmit this feeling to poeple who is hungry of DeFi solutions they will thank you soon Zk rollups are already here  So it s really a race  Solana lacks slashing and is too centralized  and there are valid long term concerns about what it takes to run a validator   Also  I ve seen plenty of issues with syncing issues and operations that just don t execute  and that s a UX nightmare  especially if people need to trust it to move large amounts of money Having said that  Solana seems to me like the only chain that has a shot at threatening Ethereum s dominance Zero knowledge proofs are fascinating  and if Ethereum can fix composability on L2  then Solana will lose  that doesn t mean Solana will fade away  just that it won t beat Ethereum They re less secure  As is Solana right now  However  unlike other PoS chains that are willing to compromise on security  decentralization  etc  When Solana implements slashing  it should in theory offer all 3 things  security  decentralization and speed Can Solana achieve that before Ethereum scales  Can it attract enough developers  All of that remains to be seen  but unlike other chains  that are just strictly worse than Ethereum at what makes blockchains tick  Solana is proposing a way of keeping all the goodies without any of the drawbacks Ftx com Thanks for keeping it up  Was panicking because I saw the 1 2 minute delay for staking accounts and am well over that time window lol I guess I will have to flood it when it s out and I can stream make videos of it For me it shows all those values you are asking about I m not a computer guy  only trying to catch a big fish I hope you are right No kidding damn you gonna be richy rich Maybe it will maybe it won t  ‍ ️ This  And the fact that it will be a long time before we see eth 2 0 scaled up  Probably much much longer than any community vitalik estimates  I believe even just the launch of eth 2 0 was years behind schedule  And scaling solutions have been promised and not delivered for many years on ethereum   In the mean time defi has to go somewhere I never used it  so not sure what is the problem  what I would recommend is to s switch to Phantom wallet  it is working perfectly Yeah probably I ll happily trade places with you  Crypto laws are the least of our worries here  Thankfully  I don t live in NYC  but I have family that does  They send pics and describe it as a war zone  It s terrible hold on you can stake srm there  not just sol Do you mean Raydium s code or Step s code there s an interview Anatoly does on solana pod with their founder  that gave me some minimum amount of comfort  he mentioned Sam calling him   and if anyone Sam knows his shit   but still I m not putting more than 2 3  of my portfolio into raydium  I can t take a project without source code seriously the problem is you can t audit their smart contract code  for all you know it could be saying while date  lt  xx xx xx    run as normal  pretend nothing bad is happening   else    withdraw all money and fuck off to maldives  I m honestly puzzled by the team s decision not to open soruce their code in a space where everyone is doing that  It just subtracts so much trust from an otherwise what could have been completely legit product Is the Staking APR for STEP USDC real  It s huge IMO  Anyone can confirm this please before i Stake there too I got you the answer Since you can t get   restore your old address   account using the latest derivation path m 44  501  0  0   you ll have to do everything from scratch again  So sorry for that  but that s how it works So i forwarded your OP to them   The Serum Support Answer     https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 740509281077428325 839006381100630016  https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 740509281077428325 839006381100630016   gt no way to transfer without incurring blockchain fees  So i asked   rephrased what he means like this    https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 740509281077428325 839008206289502229  https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 740509281077428325 839008206289502229  gt So that means he simply can t restore his wallet using the new derivation path m 44  501  0  0   Is that it  He said he couldn t find his old address in that derivation path  Does that mean he ll need to transfer all his assets from the old address to the new one manually  correct   The Serum Support Answer     https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 740509281077428325 839013113528582144  https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 740509281077428325 839013113528582144  gt Changing the derivation path results in changing the private key  So yes Can anyone explain what serum is please Lol and I thought Texas was bad Thank you so much mate  Sorry for the trouble and sincerely appreciated  I will award you once I have one perhaps next week That s what i wanted to know  i ll head to discord to get you the best answer for this  Hang on Hi Thanks alot mate  Yes I am unable to find my old address on the new derivation path  m 44  501  0  0  at all  In order to get my tokens back using the same mnemonic  I need to select the deprecated  m 501  0  0  0   somehow   Hence am not sure how to resolve it   I am using Sollet Is this experience shared by other people   I ve never used it to make trades so I wouldn t know   But if it s true  it s sure a pity When you say  disappear  do you mean   are lost irrevocably and forever I m holding at minimum until 2025  From there I ll see how it goes and maybe extend it You didn t find your old account   address in the new derivation path m 44  501  0  0   AT ALL  Is that it  Can you confirm thisIf you did find it  please click on it then click restore  everything will be back to normal The dreaded FOMO Thank you so much  I am using m 501  0  0  0  which is deprecated now  I tried to use the same mnemonic to restore a m 44  501  0  0  wallet  The wallet address is different and my tokens values are not inside  Hence am not sure how to get it transferred to new derivation path without the need to pay for custom token creation again and sending over that much  Thanks alot ELI5  This comment makes a number of statements without explaining very much   Not trying to sound like a dick 1   Would you please tell us what wallet are you using 2   Have you tried to select your address in the new derivation path m 44  501  0  0  but still unable to restore your old account   address back

moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns What about staking on Raydium   Right now I have STEP USDC in which I am earning STEP   Is this a bad idea Coinspot Not sure but since you tried so many other thing I would try having more sol  I have gotten that error custom 1 before for not leaving enough for fees  Ask in the serum discord  https   discord gg xzNMkQXv bought since its the liq pool was added to raydium  stake it since it was added to fusion pool thanks u stepfinance   really great pool You can buy STEP on Raydium  but you need to convert your SOL to USDC and then USDC to STEP   There is no SOL STEP liquidity on Raydium yet If you read their  documentation  https   solfarm gitbook io solfarm vaults strategy  you will see that the rewards you earn are sold and then auto compounded back in as additional LP tokens Ok  Raydium is working fine in USA where as Bonfida needs VpN Use Raydium for Step Finance Use Raydium

contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns If I attempt to trade on bonfida  raydium  or serum s dex  what exactly do i need to be holding in order to sell a token   I keep getting Transfer  insufficient lamports    but i m holding 0 020019001 SOL   I ve tried IOC  limit  market  disabling all browser plugins  different browsers  disabling pop up blockers  trying small orders  50  orders  manually typing in the order  prepopulating the order data from the orderbook   Nothing works   Either get a time out  error 1 custom  etc   Am i going crazy here But if that s the case  why don t people use raydium to get STEP rewards  I do see my STEP USDC LP is growing after initial deposit Yes  Bonfida is a user interface built on the serum dex  When you trade on bofida it is with the serum orderbook on the serum dex Hello  on this pair you will get step  all these pair are frome raydium  If you go on raydium farm you will know the reward went in 108 sol at 46 50 Big buy n burns Stealthex io is what I recommend for limitless swaps with no kyc  ny allowed  The other options is to connect metamask with sollet wallet and you can convert eth to Sol right from the wallet  The metamask option incurs high gas fees There isn t any portfolio viewer that accepts Sol s chain atm  Hopefully it gets sorted out soon tax time is 2 months away for us aussies  Plus having to to guess with this like STEP and ape board is just ehhhhhhhhhhhh is Bonfida legit   about to do a txn but wanted to make sure Solana is not fully decentralized YET  I think this should be the statement  As time goes by  there will be more validators to support the network and we are sure of that Your network is your networth and this applies to crypto as well somehow  Give them some time  TRX has less validations for now and Torque chain has a very high entry level Solana is doing well and need to have more validators in the very near future  I would really love to see mobile decentralization in the near future like NENGcoin and Cheetahcoin is doing  About 200 full nodes mixed with android  CPU  asic and growing  They are not the same as Solana but both are making the crypto world better  ️ Looking into Charizard Thankyou for your reply Soon we will be doubling every time the token doubles 99  of people won t buy during red candles  they re going all in during rips That puts us at around  1000 per coin  I could see it by end of year but we d have to go through a super cycle like to see this  damn i would      DJJustoPro      Commands   opt out    delete damn I would like to see this FTX 75 100 ftx https   discord gg zNvauBZJSolfarm Discord is probably the best place for these sorts of questions Your success will be the pump of all time  I m a fan Exodus yeah  I just don t want to want to eat it several times     fiat  gt eth  eth transfer etc Well you ll need to eat a small fee somewhere  I know people hate Binance but its been rock solid for me  I usually buy there  trade to SOL right on binance through their BNB SOL pair and send the SOL to my wallet Do not download this  it s harmful files   https   www virustotal com gui

I too am having issues with SOL on exodus today  No available balance shown Hoping to stake  first time exodus has messed me around What s the best way to buys this  Is it sold on any platform Just add a little bit each day or each week  Spreading it out like that will help you get in at a lower price once one comes No worries  This year is 8  inflation  then every year after that is 15  less  until the inflation rate reaches 1 5   where it will remain constant Yes the fully diluted market cap is higher than bnb while the circulating market cap is 1 1000 of bnb  Yes they do a buy and burn and it s getting significant  take a look at their Twitter Here are tokenomics https   projectserum com srm faq Oh nice  not seen this before will check it out Makes sense  thank you That s just a legal disclaimer  As your attorney I advise you to ignore it   not legal or financial advice Let s go SOL It dipped down a bit under  45  How much did you scoop up Serum is the dex with its central limit ordebook  Bonfida is a user interface for the Serum Dex  Anyone can build a user interface for the Serum Dex  they all share the same orderbook and all transactions are settled on the serum dex  The trade tab on Raydium is another popular one 300 billion This is nothing short of amazing mate what s the most effective way to convert cash to solana    xrp    ETH  and USDT seem to hsve higher exchange fees  and i can t get cash straight to FTX i liked it at 16  put WAY too little  now I m bummed out Nvm  i can hear the sound now  Thank you Still no sound 1 on  https   raydium io   https   raydium io I d like to point out that if you use this wallet 100  of your stake will go to one validator  Everstake   Everstake is already top heavy in the list of Solana validators and contributing more stake to Everstake is bad for Solana censorship resistance Everstake has the resources to give their software the feature to allow other validators to be selected in addition to their own   I would recommend that you don t stake using this software until that feature is implemented  for the betterment of the Solana network Asking guys   is there any site  telegram or other social media platform which provides latest information about projects that will be built through Solana chain    especially those that provide information about airdrops      thanks Just with email is  1000 lifetime  Email   Name   Country is  2000 day or  9000 USD daily if higher trade than transfer volume  It is unlimited with the following  	Full Legal nameDate of birthAddressProof of Address   phone jurisdictionDescription of source assetsPassport or other similar government issued identificationFacial verificationThis is from the website for FTX com but I believe it applies to FTX us as well That new addy is   temporary addy  After swap or trade  always click   settle    as mentioned by u Missi0nP0ssible   your funds automatically credited to your sol wallet You will not loosing your money while using dex  Coz there s smart contract that will protect your transactions     the possibility of losing funds can occur due to     lack of liquidity   token team rug pull Thanks Yeah  that s how I feel  I see the high yields as reflecting that it s risky staking with them Thanks for posting this Btw may i know  site  telegram or other social media platform  which provides latest

but I m hoping it moves as quickly as filecoin did   I saw that coin go from around  43 to over  200 In about 5 days and then stabilize around  150 now   Just shows how crazy crypto is and no way to tell  it all just a crazy guess or hunch how it may go   I like checking reddit and youtubers who go over charts with the triangles to make my best guess  I bought some at  13  some at  25 and some at  43   In hindsight I should ve bout more at  13 however I m new to crypto world  like 2 5 mo new   lol   This is not financial advice Yep looks like it is in binance and binance us Cool  Thank you Thank you for your answer Raydium has the deepest liquidity for a launchpad  Solstarter is also a launchpad but it s not live yet Serum is a decentralized exchange with an open central limit orderbook  built on the Solana blockchain  Serum is an entire ecosystem of defi projects which all share the same order book and settle on the serum dex  It is a unicorn in the crypto space because the speed and low cost transactions of Solana allows Serum to have a central limit orderbook on chain and most of the defi projects on Solana are built on top of Serum  It has ambitious goals to one day handle volume the size of the  Nasdaq or larger and if it comes anywhere near that it will be incredibly successful  If it doesn t  it will fail  This isn t your run of the mill defi project
2021-05-05,42.63723596,45.9277921,42.31573602,SOL is  99 99999 kkk   Ride to the moon BuyTheDip Exodus Wallet is hit or miss It dumps so hard  I m surprised that nobody calls thit shitcoin  Is it because everyone loves  SOL Thanks for the advice Stake it on ftx for 10  apy  Won t be a lot but when a single sol is worth  200  you ll be glad you did Use Sollet and Raydium instead   StepFinance was just reading this post earlier  super interesting https   docs step finance https   docs step finance BuyTheDip https   docs step finance Oh I wish to be an 18 year old noob in the Golden bullrun where defi is the most matured we ve seen with devs coming on board and solid dapps being built   You re in the right place  Enjoy 30   SOL 70   RAY not financial advice U can also stake  ray on RAYDIUM website for 47  apy The stairs should be going down not up  Down 57  on the 1 week Wow  dude that is such a good suggestion  That really points me in the right direction Stop using crappy exchanges   Problem solved Thanks for the info man appreciate it im a newb in SOL Nah that s about the only spl token I have no interest in whatsoever Prediction  somewhere between august November How about you make a useful post explaining what you do instead of spamming a bunch of garbage posts You can use the serum dex through multiple front ends like raydium  stepfinance  serumdex ch  All you need is a Sollet or phantom wallet  There are a few others  but I can t vouch for any of them ok  let me try it on there  Won t matter if I can t get the majority of it off of Exodus Im pretty sure you can sell on FTX  Sounds like Binance is having alot of issues right now Never understood why every protocol needs a token  I personally use step here and there  but I don t see how the token accrues value Maybe if you hodl long enough they will fix whatever problems I am encountering  Binance let me buy SOL  but won t let me sell it This is not an epoch problem  I have had my SOL unstaked since before April 20th Use Raydium and swap with USDC from a sollet Have you staked your SOL  If yes  you will need to unstake in order to exchange See you on the  SOL jet brother May 2021 The main DEX of Solana Similar to people who   Hold  ETH  hold  UNIAnd anyone who holds  BNB holds  CakeHm I actually watched this video  so I too can TLDR TLDR  Solana is going to moon  No reasons  It just is 0 i dont know about RAY Edit i see now   thanks for letting me know it Im on binance The real question is   how much  ray do you have SOL has been giving me issues for the past 2 weeks on Exodus and Binance  They both say  Down in the US   or  Limited exchange availability   I am feeling super scammed by SOL lately What exchange or wallet do you use  Because  so far my experience with SOL has been   Good luck withdrawing a profit from it Exodus and Binance are both having issues  for the past 2 weeks straight  Is SOL always glitchy at best Its called phantom and is currently in beta You triple that amount in no time Nice  With any luck you ll have it by Christmas Can anyone tell me how to get out of SOL  I have an exodus and I have binance  Neither will let me send or exchange SOL  I have been trying for weeks  What does it matter what price SOL gets to if I cannot trade it or send it quicker solutions  buy usdc on coinbase  takes about 3 5 days for ach transfer to clear   amp  send it to FTX so you can withdraw spl USDC buy btc on cash app  send btc to FTX  sell for USD  withdraw spl USDC you could send the btc directly to sollet but im not exactly sure how deep the liquidity for btc is on Serum  Hope this helped What s not great  What it shows is how decentralized SOL actually is  Lots of smaller 2million SOL validators  As for how much SOL is staked total   320Million SOL is a lot  Maybe that will push the price up Trapping people in the currency  How    you can sell 100  of your sol for USDC or trade sol for ray  amp  then back into USDC on raydium   amp  how are we toxic The numbers are not great right Hello everyone  SolFlare developer here  Here goes my first reddit post I would like to thank you for your comprehensive post and would like to give a bit of a background story to SolFlare We have built SolFlare in the early days of Solana wanting to contribute to its community with a free to use wallet solution  The initial build of SolFlare included only wallet creation  basic Ledger integrations and basic SOL transferring  At later stages we have added basic SPL token management  anyone remembers when Serum was distributed   and staking functionalities  We did all of that to support growing the community and providing non CLI tools to onboard new users easier I would like to remind you that SolFlare   Is non custodial   we never own and control any of your funds  If the funds don t show up in the UI that is because the RPC servers are overloaded and sometimes unresponsive  Free to use   we don t charge any additional fees on top of transfers or staking transactions  We have a staking delegation interface that is randomized that promotes decentralization and we DO NOT have a profit sharing agreement with a validatorRecently a lot of Solana app developers have encountered scaling issues where the RPC servers provided by the foundation weren t sufficient to timely serve all the data that is needed  The cost of the hardware to run such servers on our own would cost anywhere between  800  2000 per month which is not sustainable for us  We have been putting up ongoing efforts to creatively solve the problem of not being rate limited which was successful at some times  but not the others  This usually resulted in the user not being able to see all of their funds or newly created staking accounts  When such things occur we follow our Telegram channel for patterns of the same request and then we approach mediation  We do not have a customer support team nor is it our goal to support one in perpetuity Taking all this into consideration we have identified the need to approach maintenance  rolling out new features and support more proactively and cater to the Solana newcomers but this is not an easy problem to solve since SolFlare itself doesn t generate any revenue Steps that we have taken to mediate the situation  even before this post    We have started efforts of rewriting SolFlare from scratch for the ultimate goal of it being   open sourced   and much more stable  SolFlare will have a brand new UI with massively optimized UX  We have started designing and implementing features that enhance the staking experience like analyzing your returns  We will be providing more authentication methods to SolFlareOur previous initiatives did include building mobile wallets and browser extensions but they never got off the ground due to the lack of funding  We are open to talking to the community and build them if appropriate interest exists We are a small focused team  and we hear your concerns   but we are not always able to immediately respond to issues that may arise  Rest assured that we plan to address most of the problems as soon as possible  especially regarding the stability of the app and overall staking experience  We will soon share further updates about the new SolFlare redesign and other improvements we are planning As an additional idea  I have created a   SolFlare Beta   telegram group  Anyone who wishes to participate in the rebuild process is welcome to join   https   t me solflare _beta  https   t me solflare_beta     It will need a bit of getting used to but we will plan to post our progress there  Everyone is welcome Once again  we are firm believers in the Solana Ecosystem and that is why we are actively building in it  We deeply apologize for any inconvenience that we have caused to our users and hope that our new efforts will bring back days of glory to SolFlare How can buy sos Explorer for the developer fund  https   dogechain info address

investors vulnerable   There are good times and bad times to buy any project and this opens new people up to FOMO in and buy are really shit times Pull your head in and stop creating bullshit gt  exodus We are experiencing temporary server issues with Solana  SOL  at the moment  Please be assured that your funds are safe  we are investigating and working to rectify the problems  Sending  receiving  exchanging  and staking SOL is currently affected  We are here to answer any questions you have  Please contact us via email at  support exodus com  mailto support exodus com This is they job  speculation a  This metric is from 2017 when a huge proportions of projects had literally nothing to show except a whitepaper  so it s fairly outdated as an idea b  It s a top 20 coin  with a functional product and billions of dollars of capital to fund development  it will definitely make it through the next bear market I think higher gt  but now they have a huge war chest to develop withWho is  they  though lol  there s no  dogecoin foundation  that was holding loads of doge to profit from this  It was abandoned by the original devs years ago rip This was after the epoch finished and the funds were on the staking account undlegated  Then exodus autowithdraws to your primary  staking authority  address  The explorers showed the accound with the correct amount  exodus showed 0 for hours until I reinstalled the app  During that time  I wanted to access my wallet with Sollet   by exporting the mneumonic from exodus   did not work  Upon investigation  it seems that non BTC coins are not recoverable I guess W whist have to wait If you unstake it you still have to wait the epoch to finish  I did it once too and had to wait for 2 days until the rpoch finished and then they appeared in my wallet  In that time the balance and staking showed 0 Funds are safu  The fuck i want to put some more sol in raydium today and i get fucked Dude it takes forever like 12 days Global  Sorry for not making that clear I staked a few SOL via exodus  the app showed I had 0 after unstaking even when the explorer showed the correct ballance  Tried to import the mnemonic to sollet   didn t work   so if exodus goes under   you re screwed Way More than that same issue here Crypto markets are not logical except on longer time frames  Ethereum was making big gains  People were misled or misunderstood the relationship and bought in as a relational play  Problem is ETC has no use case  However  I would say the same about DOGE  but now they have a huge war chest to develop with  Doge could become something EOS and XTZ raised a ton of money and just squandered it so don t hold out hope Read their reviews in the app store  No one can get their money when they want to sell  Over 1 month to hear from customer service who doesn t give them an answer  Problems with balances being different and confirmations of the wrong cryptos being purchased Ive read so many reviews on Binance us that they cant pull their money from Binance us that they have been for months calling customer service and still cant get their money Binancr has a 10 day wait  Think it s for time for any potential fraudulent activity to resolve Buy USDC on Coinbase and sending to FTX then converting  That s the fastest way no hiccups FTX com fuck binance  leave it and get on DEXs Given that it is on  binance us  https   binance us  I am not sure that makes sense I doubt they ever will  SOL is a private coin and the US Feds can t access transactions on SOL  so the Feds will sue any platform that carries SOL and or fine them for non transparency Binance us not working too  They are becoming a real problem Okay I ll sell you some SOL for  60 if you just want to see the numbers go up this is awesome  I legit just bought a helium miner Any alternative recommendations  Their UI is buggy too I am staking Solana witb exodus  Is there any way of knowing how much you have received via staking  Unlike ada or algo where you claim the staked amount  solana says its automatic  But hard to gauge how productive the staking pool is because I cant see anywhere how much I have claimed via staking Their system is stretched out  that s all  Usually it is fixed in a couple of hours  They even had suspended BNB withdrawals to BSC quite a few times these past weeks  so if people see an evil conspiracy from Binance against SOL here they are wrong Don t even Nothing you just need the transaction cost of sol which are almost zero I m still waiting forinfo also Is this Binance US or the other global one Well I got excited to see HNT listed on Raydium and it s also listed in the Sollet wallet  but there s no liquidity on Raydium yet I guess  and I can t for the life of me figure out where how one wraps HNT onto SOL to deposit into Sollet anyway  There aren t many exchanges that list HNT  and certainly no DEX s  so that was nice to see  but also a bit of a tease  ha  The Helium community would flock to SOL Raydium if HNT trading is available You re gonna get paper handed out of crypto so quickly lol https   www reddit com r ethtrader comments 6d62td the_story_behind_ethereum_classic_etc_and_whos  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source shareThis is why  ETC is trash I wonder if they are configuring support for spl tokens  Ie  kin support and the rest if the gang if it happened  they will shor each other  D Hate when people are so negative  Just block em and move on Binance us  https   Binance us  has sol Ha  No prob  I went through the same thing recently Im staking on FTX Are there minimum transfers for SOL in and out of exodus  And how are the fees u digitalinstincts  https   www reddit com u digitalinstincts   Thanks for dropping in  HODLer and buyin  dips  Was just creeping on your LinkedIn and saw you did a lot of work with healthcare informatics  Do you plan on helping bring healthcare to Solana  If so  to what extent and where do I sign up  Physician You need to have at least    0 000005 SOL    in your Sollet Wallet for Transaction Fees  Gas Unfortunately  you can t immediately delegate new SOL by transferring it into an already delegated account  You ve got two options to increase the stake balance of that account 1  Deactivate the account and wait for it to cool down before redelegating with the increased balance 2  Withdraw the extra SOL that you transferred and just create delegate a 2nd stake account Oh boys find a job please Binance US Thank you  I will check it out Exodus seems to have resolved it s issues   Maybe Binance has  too Agreed Exactly for the reason you mention  The supply of SOL is higher  Now  if the question is why is ETC pumping  I wouldn t discount some buyers not distinguishing ETH from ETC nah i think SOL will be better than ETH 2 0 and ETH 2 0 will still need 2 years Just regular market cycle Omg thanks  I feel stupid now  For both my writing and that I wasnt able to get that myself I m new into crypto   now I all in SOL   Because SOL is excellent projects with ecosystems for future  Ride to the moon       3000   May 2022  Remind me 5 2022 if you follow the SOL price Bear market won t be for another 6 months I believe Oddly agree w this I used uphold Why Bearish  Eth 2 0 It s staked  not stacked   Click on the address in that wallet  to the left of the delegate button  and withdraw the funds then you can send them I did  No I hav the status  not delegated  and a  delegate now  button  But no withdraw button anywhere Yes i have the same Problem  i have sent today at 8 am from Solflare to Binance   but Binance dont show me my amount Forget it   ride to up to the moon I have been withdrawing tons of SOL this week til FTX and Sollet   but today i also have issues Totally agree  SolFlare is a bit of a junk show   Really not that intuitive to sync with a Ledger Nano X properly  and the rewards transparency is marginal at best  Daedalus wallet  10 10  for Cardano is my litmus  so I am biased   You can download a  csv report of your rewards  on Daedalus  at the end of each epoch and calculate and track the performance of your stake pool   Would feel a lot better SolFlare made some improvements to their dashboard i thing you need  wait 2 or 3 days from the moment you  press  undelegate   Button  Thats is written on the Page when you delegate Yes i deposited today at 8 am from Ledger   Solflare  to Binance   But Binance dont show me this amount  in my Binance Wallet Does anyone know when this will be resolved Got my funds delegated on Solflare it took a day Yep best option at the moment  Hight APR and Stack Unstack with just 1 click on a button I m from Taiwan and I use Reddit for Solana Can u share with me Do you have any sol in your wallet No considation Wow that escalated quickly  calling me a newb but the dude is only holding    You are missing every penny you should make by doing your everyday trades  Its basic mathematic but go for it and insult everybody friendly you don t know lolAin t nobody ever said  I m enjoying the slow burn gtfo XD Yeah you re clearly a newb  whining about the price and wanting to time the market  Just shut up and hold Source  carbonara Actually the problem seems bigger  12 hours ago I managed to withdraw SOL from Binance out to Exodus  and althought Exodus confirmed a successful transfer yet  they can t show the balance so I can t stake  their support says they got problems overall with any SOL transaction  Go figure what s going on but it s not just Binance Fuck Binance man  I really needed to deposit some Sol to Binance  Knowing Binance this thing could easily take weeks I moved a lot of my BTC ETH earnings into smaller cap projects like SOL   I m trying to pick future winners now  I guess   Sometimes it is painful to see how much ETH has risen over the past 5 months  but I keep telling myself there are much better projects  technically  like SOL and others   If you are going to be balls deep in crypto  it s probably best to diversify  IMO   And Hodl for the long game They claim sending to a delegated staking wallet will lose the funds  I have seen additional SOL sent to a staking wallet  but only while undelegated I had that problem a few days ago as well and you just need to keep trying  It will eventually go through  although their site does say that there are issues with SOL right now too Do we have a price prediction for Serum Nice which validator did you choose You think so  I m relatively new to the space so after 3 months of podcasts Reddit I m not quite a pro  but I have picked a few of my favorite projects and teams  Are you interested in multiple or think I should just pick a winner and stick with them  Some love DOT some love SOL  Cosmos and Polygon are already in use  and there s plenty of great projects like Ankr  Filecoin or Maker  Again  still learning and would love to hear your thoughts P S  I heard SOL is powerful enough to  capture 95  of the market some day  and loved hearing the team talk about how happy they are with their product  So I m pretty much sold Cheers The overvaluation reaccumulation phase of a lifetime Source  Trust me bro Way higher than that imo Any problem with staking on Binance  That s where I am staking now I got the same issue today   had been waiting for more than 6 hours and the withdrawal is still in processing You got the best of both worlds now   Jealous Unfortunately  you would have to create a new address every time you want to add more  even if it is the same delegator  It s for safety or some stuff  it s stated on their website as well  Happy staking same bought it yesterday and binance won t let me withdraw now I find the Solana Discord and seems to have issue and now solve  I have to wait tonight to have a look Exodus tbf they said the same about doge so    yuppies still talking about unlimited supply lmao Smart move  ️ I should ve sold at 49  to rebuy during the dip but unfortunately I m just here holding I don t even know what the APY is for my stake   I m just doing it blind I enjoy the sustainable slow burn  I don t want a big correction  Bought my bag at  3 so I m chillin Also  moonlet sees staking account created through solflare which failed to show up on their website I just tried this  tnx for suggestion  I guess we re in new millenium    staked my SOL through a mobile wallet using Ledger over bluetooth 27000  step usdc  How Could be wrong but I think it s because the chains so fast  Although that is a huge number of slots to be behind  I ran into this issue once with solflare  but it was only behind a few or a few hundred   slots  I tried again in like 10 seconds and it worked When you try it again  does the number of slots it s behind change In this webinar we talk with Founder and CEO Anatoly Yakovenko about some of SOLANA s key innovations that allow it to provide incredibly fast and cheap operations including Proof of HistoryTower Byzantine Fault ToleranceBy the end of this conversation you ll have a good understanding of this technology and how to get involved too Duration  30min https   zoom us webinar register WN _6aPCLs0MRpuISZ5UHjEU0A  https   zoom us webinar register WN_6aPCLs0MRpuISZ5UHjEU0A any update man Agreed  And I still can t see my staking rewards in Solflare I m using exodus   10 52 you can t buy from non us binance BUT you can trade stuff for it  i got mine with USDT Most will not survive    but sol is not one of them it will thrive longterm Hi   I had the same problem yesterday   fixed by refreshing blockchain  I use a desktop computer     On Solana page  click the 3 dots at top right corner  then click  Refresh Blockchain  from the drop down list   the 4th one from the top After it has finished  the balance and value are correct I know someone solved the same problem by deleting and reinstalling the app on mobile phone I staked my ETH before realizing I m pro SOL I used FTX us to buy Sol and no issues so far  I m in CT so also restricted Soon come I ve been reading threads and listening to crypto podcasts for a few weeks now and it s safe to say    I m all in on Solana  The guys running the show are smart and easy to understand and inspire me  The project is in a league of its own and I m excited to see where we are 4yrs from now  I ll be buying shares weekly for the rest of my life Its nice to see predictions like this but in all honesty As long as the cryptomarket is bullish like the last couple of months  there is no way anyone can predict the market Im all in for Solana  however I will take it day by day Moonlet has the comparison  Go to your stake account in the bottom  then hit the validator tab  Last time I tried selecting a different validator it sort of bugged out and forced staking to themselves  not sure if this is intended  Their validator is a decent choice though  5  fee  and not part of the top 10  so aiding the network decentralization as well  Agree that comparison could be improved though Based on pure speculation but hey  LETS GO TO THE MOOOOOOOON I am new into crypto and bought  sol at 18  However  how are the chances that  sol won t survive the next bear market  Looking forward to HODL it long term but read that around 90  of alt coins don t survive a bear market I also want to transfer my sol to exodus  But there is no option to transfer it I see  thank you It s been around 12 hours thank you guy 13 10 Exodus is offering 10  APR There are currently temporaly issues mentioned from Exodus and Solana which affect sending and receiving How long has it been since you received them   I ve had this happen   The first few transfers only took a couple of minutes to display but the last one took several hours Agreed  Good defi wallets exist such as sollet  But we need better staking wallets forsure   Very glitchy experience gt Fusion pools give rewards in the tokens put into them  which are allocated by the developers for that specific purpose  They re a way to incentivize liquidity building and hodling for relatively younger tokens Thanks  First answer to Fusion pools that makes sense to me Sorry to be bearish on this but realistic we will hit around 100 200  this year and after that we will be in a bear market so i assume in around 1 2 years we will have around 50  and in the next bullrun we will hit around 2k   i would think Still great buying opportunity buy now stake it and gain yield I don t think SBF was optimising for political connections when he made that donation  I believe he s never spoken to Joe Biden or anyone close to him  and they may not even know who SBF is Yes would be good to know  Maybe u Al3xF u DigitalInstincts u garious1 could step in and share some information  Thanks in advance I agree  Just wondering if that is why it hasn t happen yet In my opinion it would be important to have thoses projects on Binance and Coinbase to expend the awareness of the Solana ecosystem Well  in my opinion every exchange wants to make money    So why shouldn t they take profits out of trading fees I feel the same way  I d appreciate some ELI5 too  I m a retard The question is will they  Would Binance ever integrate SPL or are they only trying to push BSC  Are the exchanges fighting blockchain wars  FTX  solana  Binance   BSC  Coinbase   Polkadot Thanks haha Awesome stuff   Great screen name Lol my face If the ecosystem continues to gain adoption  the sky is the limit  Awareness is the main issue Won t be easy to convince binance to support SPL  I mean Solana is binance smart chain competitor I would start with other smaller exchange If only there was a hour long youtube video with a product director explaining it all   We can only dream Thanks for your reply  Well  if you look at FTX you can see that there is huge demand for SPL tokens  Would be nice to see those tokens on Binance etc  to grow the Solana ecosystem My guest is that it depends on solana partnership and customer demand SOLANA needs an authentic staking app like cosmostation on cosmos  Awful UI design on solarflare  not a mobile wallet  So bad  This project deserve more  Built it Yes I m using Moonlet in combination with a Ledger X to stake  SOL  The process is easy and straightforward  Try it out for yourself Read the Solana docs you can create a wallet and delegate a stake all from your laptop using solana cli  This video does it but with hardware wallet https   youtu be jg2WQcfAXHo Yes It all depends on the market  Right now  Doge and ETH are pulling a lot of buyers from the market  hence the dip I think  If things settle down the price could easily reach  100 at the end of the year  In Europe Banks are leaning towards a negative interest for savings  so crypto becomes a more appealing way to store money  Lets continue holding solana and make is as stable as possible  The more stable a coin  the better long term results will be  To the moon my friends Solana is here to stay  I love the community since its way more mature than eg doge  Less daytraders and more stable imo I used FTX us also in California Yes  love the aesthetic Yes Nice  I will check when I get home from work later Why tho Look up the name of the individual who was the second largest donor to Joe Biden s campaign administration  second only to Michael Bloomberg Not surprised  Solflare is also plagued by this lately I agree with this nicely worded statement  It is clear you come from a good place with this  and I really agree that in order for this project to become a success story  Solana needs to iron out these bumps  I m still nervous about my staking account not appearing  and my first two days as a SOL hodler has not been at all pleasant  Compared to Cardanos solutions for staking and the like this is below par  I think I will use another wallet until a better staking option becomes available  Im also interested in Solanas DeFi solutions  but annoyingly these are beyond my grasp due to my SOLs being locked behind these errors delays It says   contact their support    you do that  People are complaining about it lately  even some said they can t swap   exchange there for some reason Yes  and solana beach should implement other wallet option to stake too I tried it other day and gave up Just dont understand how to add nft   too many steps And I noticed some pictures are not loading Yes On sollet Wallet   In the main account balances page you have to press the   button on the right   just above the   indicators   and then all the token you can add will appear 1000 Well seems like they fixed it   The main issue was that i needed to activate the blind settings in my ledger for me after i activated that it worked Good read and totally agree with what you just said  i personally hope SolFalre solve that UI problem once and for good since it s the best  IMO  that is 100  decentralized  unless you re familiar with using Solan CLI which gives you the best option Yes

Glad I found this page and project  just adding this great project to my holdings Hey there  Chris from Phantom here  Apologies  there is an issue specially with RAY which the Raydium team is aware of  Hope we can find a fix soon  Other tokens should work Source    https   solana com staking timing  https   solana com staking timing  amp  x200B  amp  x200B When you delegate or un delegate a stake account  the tokens do not change state immediately  Newly delegated tokens are considered  activating  or  warming up   and are not eligible to earn rewards until they are fully activated  Newly un delegated tokens are considered  deactivating  or  cooling down  and are not able to be withdrawn until deactivated The Solana protocol only allows stake tokens to finish changing state at the beginning of a new epoch  An epoch is approximately 2 days long  Use   solana epoch info   to see details of the current epoch If you delegate tokens in a stake account in the middle of an epoch  the tokens will appear in your wallet as  activating  until the current epoch ends  at which point they will be active and eligible to earn rewards  Whether you delegate your stake tokens near the beginning of the current epoch  or near the end of the current epoch does not impact when the tokens will become active  which is only at the next epoch boundary  The same logic applies to un delegating or deactivating a delegated stake account  Deactivating tokens cannot be withdrawn until they have finished deactivating at the epoch boundary I was super late brought in about 3 days ago   wish I d waited could have brought the dip STILL going through it    _  amp  x200B This is my first time staking too        what a delight You match this community so well I have been thinking that and asking  on this forum  about how to get out of exodus for 9 days now Lol  fuck off Ok  if it s a personal problem  help me figure out what I have done wrong  You know  rather than white knight out over some shit that doesn t matter when it comes down to trying to figure this out  on this forum  for over a week There is something obvious in here  you keep saying you couldn t move your sol out of exodus wallet  that s exodus wallet problem in my opinion  sol has nothing to do with it  Sol transaction can be finalized in couple seconds I i were you I ll just get my sol out of exodus and will never use it again Sorry that your investment went bad Same here stuck with sol on exodus  I wonder when exchange is available just exit completely That doesn t look like a helpful comment either  I have been on this forum with a lot more patience for a minute  I have just lost my patience  You are right  I shouldn t be mean  This just is not the way that any crypto with a future should be working  I E  not working for weeks at a time    Not my fault that I ve seen  Down in the US  literally every time I see my wallet for over a week at a time SOL has one of the fastest growing DEX that is running millions of transactions in a day that clears in seconds   the total liquidity just exceeded  1B USD I think you got a personal problem  the blockchain is doing JUST FINE You can withdrawal to any wallet address as long as it s on the sol block chain Wanting to get your investment out doesn t mean you should slam a scam tag on a blockchain that s just gaining momentum  Maybe you should be nice with how you use your words too Still not working  I tried leaving a message for them on their site  but even that didnt go through  Starting to vex me a bit tbh  I will probably use sollet or some other wallet instead if or when I regain my SOL I was trying to put my SOL back into ETH before it went up and a few days ago on doge  before it did this  I may be new  I may not be technically savvy  but this is a real issue  I am seriously considering removing all of SOL coin after a few weeks of feeling like this is worse than Robinhood  Exodus is telling me this is bigger than them and that is only after like a week and a half of waiting for someone to get back to me  exodus problem Sorry about that  i was referring to Exodus Wallet  my bad  you should contact their support if you re unable to swap   exchange there Post Edited Bro  back off  I love this tech  but I am wary of these types of things now  Why don t you make a worthwhile response to help someone who just wants to get their investment out  You ain t helping What does moonlet have to do with Exodus or SOL Is it possible to withdrawal to centralized exchange address You need 50ktps of demand  Capacity    demand   If we have that much demand  4tb per day is inexpensive If you re going to spread FUD try be be creative at least Ok  starting around April 17th  I noticed my SOL had went up and I was hoping to take out my initial investment and put it into ETH  Since then  I have not been able to move my SOL at all  I was able to stake then I waited to unstake hoping that would toggle it  I cannot exchange  but I have been able to add more  That is super fishy and scammy to me  Others coins go down  like ADA is currently  randomly and come back up  but SOL has literally been giving me problems for 2 weeks  I am starting to compare SOL to Robinhood  Not looking good for SOL and I am not the only one having issues  This is not an epoch issue Just started staking it on exodus noticed that as well  What does it mean literally   going through the exact same thing as you all right now   oof same What pairs  There is liquidity for me  Yes you have to look at the pools on the top pools page  Or go to coinmarketcap and see what trading pairs have liquidity on Raydium  Defi is awesome with no fees  It truly is I d like to know as well Is this your SOL address   2FzSq6pYCxuut2Gzp8PVZM4s6bunnaN4ZMxvUG7ZEg4b Is this the account you Delegated your SOL to   Imgur  https   imgur com zx9aEQg  https   explorer solana com address

you are saying  amp  tell us EXACTLY what are you talking about so we can help you You can buy it from binance international Binance us I wouldn t be using  Lots of reported issues with that It is safe and it will set up  Don t stress It will be fine mate If you are worried about it you can always stake through platforms like ftx But I wouldn t be concerned about it I m just starting to learn my way around  I noticed there often isn t sufficient liquidity to trade pairs I try on Raydium  Is there a place where you can see all the pools  I ve seen the  top pools  page  Maybe that is all of them FFS  It really is the wild west out here  I hate that there scammers working literally every chain  ETH was scammers paradise for a while  now BSC seems to be their main go to  Sad that they end up everywhere Looks like the price Also   although you can t send usdc directly from coinbase you can send usdc directly from ftx us   you could also send usdc from coinbase to ftx us then from ftx us to your wallet This is because coinbase has erc20 version of usdc  Sollet takes spl  solana based   Ftx us has them both and sends the correct version based on wallet adress without issue Click on the trading tab on Raydium  Sell sol for usdc  Buy cope with usdc It s the first blockchain project I read that I really believed in  I was late to the party  only discovering the solana ecosystem about 3 weeks ago but have real conviction about what the whole space can achieve Amazing Stat indeed  Let s keep this high qualityWe re growing so fast like Solana lol Im having the same issue  I staked my SOL via SolFlare  stake account being not created         Did I lost them Blockfolio Ftx us or just ftx if not in US You need to switch to Pro version  or use a  convert  option  It converts Usdt to Sol even though it s not shown on the main page of the light version   I m talking about Binance app What is SBF s role in the leadership or Solana You can buy from Binance   com     Use  USDT to buy here  https   www binance com en trade SOL_USDT type spot Use  BTC to buy here  https   www binance com en trade SOL_BTC type spot Use  BNB to buy here  https   www binance com en trade SOL_BNB Thanks  Let me know if you have any requests or ideas I like this one  good job my friend Solmates twitter is a good place imo to be update with the latest solana ecosystem There is also another twitter account called   solana ecosytem   or something like that Ftx Thank you so much for updating your OP so others will benefit if they face the same problem as yours I ve faced the same issue after staked my solana  I used Firefox and get it works Thanks to your answer  I was able to find the solution  The repository for the PR request changed  now it is this https   github com solana labs token list My seed pw is 101  correct even if the button is grey I clicked and it gives me a new wallet address my old wallet has disappeared along with the funds someone plz help Xmr has like 4 subs lol But they don t like support or meme questions on their main sub No slashing by protocol means that slashing  if needed  would happen through central authority  Most SOL is held by the foundation itself  and most validators were kick started with a bunch of SOL provided by the foundation  KYC included   and the extremely high costs of running a validator are concerning for decentralization Backend problems with solflare  shouldnt lose funds and will likely be fixed soon  Nothing wrong with the chainPretty annoying though  Probs because of the huge influx of users Gate io  but you must do the KYC to withdraw  Gate has a large selection of alts The new accounts take a while to setup  If you have money missing  its definitely setup and you wont lose your funds  it just takes a while for it to showup  The solflare staking has been glitchy lately  Apparently it will be updated soon and the devs know about it  Let me know if it shows up by tmmw This is HUGE https   subredditstats

2021-05-06,44.97405216,44.97405216,42.59158516,Liberals  Yikes  Go outside bruv Just speculation but I think this push it will reach about  100 at most  Solana is a holder and a keeper though   this is an Ether killer  Buy some  stake it  in years to come you ll have more and in years to come   HOPEFULLY    we see it in the same region of ethereum prices After sending Eth from one wallet to another for  85 and it took 6 hrs I m done with ETH projects   It is a flawed concept  and now they are hurrying up to correct it  IMO   Why would I utilize that platform ever If you like the project  throw a few bucks at it  Watch it move up and down  Stay on top of the updates  Dollar cost average when prices go down  Don t go all in on the first hand   just my opinion  Not a FA Based solely on recent posts about  binance us  https   binance us  I am scared for my money on there I bought 3 at 7 or so a lot of rich traders are bullish on it but I dont quite understand the project and whats the token used for The withdrawal feature is disabled  Probably doing maintenance    I dunno exactly Wow I didnt know  Thats useful to know  I m planning to join FTX to buy and hodl FTT  SOL  SRM  Also to stake them  Still using Binance for trading though So for you  you d transfer in SOL to your sollet  go to Raydium io  connect your sollet  and trade half your SOL for RAY  Then  go to the liquidity tab and convert your sol ray to sol ray LP  Then connect your sollet to solfarm and delegate there the risk is that the price of ray goes to hell while you are staking so ends up not being worth even if you gain more of the coin if it lost a lot of value as the other guy said you need to conver it to RAY Ahhh yeah  Everything is through sollet  I m farming step usdc  So what I did was make a sollet  supply it with sol  went to Raydium to swap to usdc  leave a little bit like 0 1 for transactions   and then traded half of the usdc for step  Went to the  liquidity  page and put step and usdc in the two spots and converted them to a step usdc LP  That is stored in your sollet  then when you go to solfarm  just connect your wallet and delegate your liquidity token to whichever farm you chose Soon I believe the same is true about Raydium  Tbh I m not the one who should answer technical questions  just thought I d share my experience using both platforms Edit  wrong reply line Because solana is backed heavily by Sam bankman and I don t think the man will let the price crash gt SolfarmIs it secure to use it now  It says it is in beta and experimental ETC PWNING YOUR FACES Solana feels like the worst investment for me so far  Bought on 48 ever since then it s going down    When moon Ah  interesting  Okay  that makes sense I guess  so your RAY is used on the site for people to purchase  kind of like a bank loan your money 1  What happens if a whale sucks the RAY pool dry  is this the  risk  that you wouldn t then be able to withdraw  2  Do you recommend this kind of concept   seems like a cool way to make some bank 42  is nuts right I like Solfarm io but haven t tried out step tbh  Solfarm automatically compounds your farming rewards whereas Raydium you have to harvest and dedicate them back in yourself  I like sol  srm  and ray in that order personally Not sure  it s hard to understand  is a great excuse for misinformation  But I get it  sometimes it s easier to simplify with brevity I m not sure it s doing well  ETC has flippened it and the SOL ETH chart doesn t look great Anyone have any ideas why the price is so solid  Very little fluctuation I love how in 2017 projects had to pretend to be something even though it was just a vapor ware rug pull  now in 2021 people are going out of their way to specifically advertise meme coin pump and dumps haha this is the kind of shit that will get crypto regulated  but it s still neat to watch this all play out This is not financial advice This is not solana staking technically Can anyone recommend a wallet for staking Sol on Android moonpaymoonpay is based in London UK  and listed on Solana s ecosystem page Solana was not available when I saw your post this morning  now it s available for purchase again Why  what s the issue  I would like to withdraw soon as well  at the right time You can choose any validator you want  SolanaBeach io has a good breakdown of the validators and commissions they take on rewards  Even shows websites for validators pretty transparent  Check it out I ll hodl till the crash  sell then rebuy on the dip  then hodl even more  But just want to be prepared for it The difference is wich coin you ll use to buy sell SOL NFA lol I have a feeling you re right Staking is delegating your voting power on the network for the validators to approve transactions  In return you receive a fee of every block your validator  mine  More coins you have  more you earn The dip has only started I have a feeling that from here the price will either go up  down or stay the same In this bull market will defo reach around 100ish Next target 67 69 Indeed  I recently discovered solana and its price strength is spectacular compared to other currencies Nice username Solana is in a great place right now  and the way it s moving is fairly consistent  I wouldn t worry about anything  In fact  I bought some SOL at a bit of a higher price this past week   47 so i m pretty happy it dropped so i can average back down  Believe in the project  and buy the dips Even in this bull market It s risen 4000  from the lower low  Don t expect much left in the gains i found it    I had to go on market RAY SOL and click on settle Hodl Hi I am also using phantom wallet  On radyium I have the same issue than you I can t swap I tried on bonfida  to switch     6 5 sol to RAY  the transaction was validated but now I don t have my sol anymore neither RAY The transaction is a success  https   explorer solana com tx

not someone that just falls for some stupid guy on the TV telling them to buy some thing Yeah you re probably not as anonymous on here as you think its likely  Look at the chart in the last 2 months  We are far from over Use Bittrex to buy USDC and then you can transfer it out straight away   Actually any token coin  once you buy it can be moved out from that exchange is it correcting Exodus Oh that s it Fair but look at the comment section   what u just said would go over their head IMO It s not too complicated to explain that RAY uses Serum DEX to automatically place taker orders  If anything it is eye opening 30 days How long is the lock period Na I think it will go up pretty soon again  The last two months were insane  The run is not over  Its just a dip  Id buy more if I were you binance Have you tried to     Settle     you funds  It located there under     Wallet Balance The primary function for rent is to prevent network spam  If there was no such thing anyone could create countless wallets clogging the network  Another function is to compensate data keepers  solana is expected to general gigas of info when working at billion user scale  without an incentive for someone to keep data storage validato rs hardware would get full pretty quick  we re not there yet though How does that work Does the protocol incentivize delegators to select smaller pools  Or is it a free for all Seed Words are not saved in browser history He can always access his wallet using the password he wrote the first time he opened the wallet  but that can be done using the same browser her used to pen the wallet the first time  BUT    So important    once his browser cache   cookies are deleted  he ll loose that wallet  amp  the only way to restore it is though the seed words My advice  if he s still able to access his wallet using the password only  is to send all his asset to a new wallet before it s too late Thank you everyone   I m sure you can tell I am new to this  and so I appreciate your help I was told that Ray would be a  30 coin during this cycle by someone who studied the fundamentals  I bought it at  7 and honestly haven t been disappointed Yes Bettt good investment Can someone explain to me what staking is  What are the pros and cons  Appreciate any insight from all of you knowledgeable folks out there  I m heavy in VeChain and just started in SOL I haven t used this cause Bonfida doesn t work in the US  But did you settle the transaction Yes exactly I just pressed a button on Exodus wallet Not sure if it s the best but it was dang easy and 10 5  which feels decent check out the solana docs  They teach you how to stake from your laptop onto the network  no third party to go through  Pick your own validator validators usually charge a commission 5  10  on rewards for all the staked SOL they have  They need about 20 000 40 000 SOL to break even Solana is ass right now  I d have put your money in eth and staked that  I m holding my sol in hope it might go up  Right now I think we will be lucky if it hits 50  again by the end of this year I m kinda a rookie  do people stake because they are believers in a project and plan to hold long term  Get a little bonus Where staking SOL Thanks for your info  How important are rent rewards then if block and stake rewards are the primary incentives I dont need the money so i can wait a looong time i guess King shit   salute Good start young king  Get back to the pavement and grind it out in the meantime  should be buying more on weekly basis Nice to meet you Dad HelloI have tried to swap 58 USDT to get 58 USDC using Bonfida SWAP interface  Basic Mode  Once the transaction processed I could see the 58 USDC within the SWAP widget but nothing in my SOllet wallet  Tried to look it up from other Solana tools   STEP  Raydium  but my USDT balance has cleared and my USDC balance is at 0  amp  x200B I checked within Solana Explorer and could see that my funds went to another address after the SWAP occurred   Which address is that   and why did it go there since it was supposed to be a swap within my own wallet addresses  amp  x200B I now see a message on Bonfida  Pro Mode  that Swap is being deprecated  How do I get my funds back  THanks for your helpG Hi gonna buy today on binance  I m Dad I am gonna buy today on binance Be ok with losing it if a bear market hits and youll be rich in like 5 years fr It s because I bought some lol Yes you right  I think I was the last one Yeah  I m willing to know too  Actually I d love to have complete list of all options  I d like to choose staking pool that helps decentralization of Solana me too  yesterday y made a ticket for binance  it was written can be  takes  3 5 days for answer Young man  greatness awaits there is no stake

some ark and harmony for long shots Super solid  Can t wait to find out the next event Exodus  Solflare  and recently moonlet are the most popular places  Exodus is probably easiest when my entire portfolio was red  SOL had a run   Now SOL has a lil retrace  my portfolio is having a run   Diversification is key  and also  SOL is doing great  a lot of buzz lately  sit tight and hodl   stake if you have to Hmm the instructional page seems to indicate otherwise   The first step is to create a Sollet io wallet  Your Sollet io wallet can be funded with SOL or with ETH that will be converted to SOL using the convert function of Sollet io You probably are not able to convert ALL of the ETH in your MetaMask wallet  you need to leave enough behind to fund the transaction I use raydium for farminh  138  apy Lots of recent reviews by unhappy Binance us customers  https   www trustpilot com review binance us Thank you my friend for this advice Binance  but you need to covert you GBP to BNB  gas  and then buy as a Spot order   Or you could buy any coin from coinbase  like for example Cardano  move that to Exodus and the exchange Your post has been automatically removed because your

Man    Write it down somewhere on a piece of paper in a specific notebook For the love of bitcoin  use a hardware wallet Binance has it and has staking also I think it s recent gains still overtakes any recent losses   You re doing good by hodling SOL and not Doge Another tip  don t share your amount of crypto online I have heard that Google auto correct and spell checker can be exploited on a compromised PC Yes   I have the same Problem but on the Binance Global   im too have send much times  without problems But Yesterday  morning y send from my Solflare Wallet to Binance   Im still waiting  Its not on my Wallet at Binance Ditto   same These are good observations   If you are following crypto for some time  it has become much like sports teams and their respective hardcore fans   The BTC Maximalists vs the Eth  Vs Eth killers  etc and their sub has gotten a bit cultish   Frankly don t have the time to investigate each individual user history to see if its pump and dump botting etc but I suspect that their is some of that going on  because it certainly is elsewhere This I cannot understand DITTO  please can you explain There is a guy with 1 1 million cakes staked and it seems he is getting the earnings into Ditto  are we missing something stake it in a wallet like exodus so you gain 10 percent annually on top of it  great move I missed the airdrop  and I m sick of it Still having trouble on the Binance US   It says withdrawal is turned off Cheers They fixed it i guess i can withdraw now Staking SOL since 14  until it hits 150  It honestly has the potential to hit the 50 billion market cap   183  per coin I started crypto since end of April only haha  too bad I wasn t able to enter sooner  But I agree with this sentiment  doge is bad for crypto in general The best meme coin  SAMO Would the same process work with an exodus wallet  I just tried looking  but it said my balance is only 0 01 Yes on Binance  I use only this exchange It s indeed not without any risk  Do some research on impermanent loss before you step into farming and fusion pools You can stake  RAY on Raydium  which gives an 45  APR at the moment I don t have that issue on international Binance  They charged me 0 01 SOL to withdraw  and that s it On binance  Ew Stake on defi   aka serum etc  So much better I did the same with 1000 as a 19 year old  Ive already almost doubled my money  Wise choice I have had 16 SOL on solflare for only 1 epoch so far   I put in 16 and they staked 15 98 reserving 0 02 as  rent exempt reserve    After the activation period  not sure how long that is but wasnt long at all  and first epoch  I have 16 01 staked   So yeah not much but if ur just holding  its free SOL so why not   The key file is the only thing that concerns me about the solflare wallet   what if something happens to it   it is a file downloaded to my computer but that means I cant check it from anywhere else etc   Not sure about that part  need to do more research into how it all works before putting more SOL there   Hope that helps On Raydium  you place your coins in a liquidity pool  The concept is different from staking Yeah I did my research and don t want it to become a pump n dump a la Doge  The moon boy  when  500  on every sub is bad for crypto You re unable to spell  and stop talking shit Binance definitely has it  I ve bought from there binance Binance us here  I have sent sol from my solflare wallet to binance numerous times  But this time it s  still  awaiting verification   It s been a day now  anyone having this problem Hi just sheding light on the noobs  I m Dad I m just sheding light on the noobs  This is just complicating things Zoom out to more than a month and chill  it s flying  If everything was just green all the time no one would do anything and just put money in and watch it grow Got to have a little bit of variance Damn I had read something to the tune of this recently on the forum  Didn t realize they did it to ADA as well    It definitely has more weight as an argument now   only solution I see is to move everything to FTX When i was 18  i saw bitcoin at 50  and wanted to buy 1 or 2  I afraid of missing like 100 euros so I didn t bought any If I had put 500  on it  I will now have almost a half million dollar What did you use for staking   Solflare Seems solved now  I managed to push mine out towards Solflare Unfortunately you need to have some SOL in your wallet to use this convert function  So this won t work neither The reason it is a higher apy is because a lot of people are swapping between the pair on Ray relative to the amount of liquidity that is in the system  This means you can gain a bigger slice of the fees that go to the liquidity with less money I mean every staked earn from Solana is automatically re staked Binance probably did it deliberately they dont want other smart contract platforms taking a piece of there Smart chains market share they did this to ADA when it was on the rise too they did it to Harmony too User name fits  your clearly a dick  This project needs  newbs  so it can grow FTX is also a centralized exchange  And that s fine if you want the noob version of Solana  However the real power is in its dex  serum via Raydium  and the others mentioned   Check out  WhalesFriend on YouTube You can also stake in a non custodial way using solflare  Pick your own validator  FTX dot us doesn t have staking SRM would be the DEX  RAY is the AMM   and more  ala acceleraytor Can you break that down for me like I m an idiot because I am lol  Does this mean that I can lose my staked ray or something Great   That took less time than my FTX KYC so I didn t get to deposit fiat on FTX yes Binance Global is working  now What about all the messages regarding issues with SOL and binance and exodus  Is that Binance specific  That s what I am wanting to be making sure of Problem solved What do you mean Working again It is just maintenance I think 1 Nothing is going on Solana has had a great run up so it needs to cool down abit before continuing just have to wait im personally accumulating more slowly with profits from others I think some the other smart contract platforms might have abit of a run before hand Near Protocol is extremely undervalued and offering same speeds as Solana Are you serious  Check out the chart  It s been booming  Relax man Crypto com It seems to be working on the non us Binance site  right now at least  The error message isnt there anymore Bought 100 Sol yesterday on BinanceUS was planning on staking on ledger only to find out they wouldnt let me withdrawal it ‍ ️ ‍ ️ can anyone help  Lol Yep   to da Mooon Guys please is available on ledger compound interest rate for staking Solana And staking gives you a great incentive to HODL  If you stake your earned interests in a compounding manner  there is no surprise that  with a good apy  in a couple of years you will end up with another cake rather than just a cherry The fees for the rent seems to be a bit high for apps with big user bases that want to integrate KIN  based on KIN   If the cost for on boarding will be reduced  i think there is a high chance  that the kin ecosystem provide an interesting model for apps to monetize in the future  The messenger Kik already integrated Kin  I think  if one or two more popular apps  hopp on  a lot of eyes will have a look into the whole Solana ecosystem and see its potential more clearly  Solana needs to reduce the rent fees as long as Ethereum doesn t implement a great solution for lower gas fees  That are just my two cents  Thank you Yeah I mean I think we might have a small wait before  50  so looking to buy up for them Your risk is 1   placing trust in a currently centralized blockchain 2   Smart contract risk 3   they are already quite large both Ray 7B  FDV and Serum at a hefty 100b  FDV There is never  no risk Yep  but I want to HODL Sol  staking is just a cherry on a cake I have the same feeling about staking  Ten days ago I purchased some SOL at  35 and after two days I was lucky to find 34 48  apy for 15 days  a sweet deal as compared to yours  as I checked from Binance now it is 10 10  apy for 30 days  locked staking in Binance  and I staked all  Otherwise I think I would sell them when it reached  47s  If I find similar deals in the future  I will stake SOL again Hi  Have you tried FTX yet  Can you withdrawal Unlike you  some of us got in kind of late  like 30s  so I don t begrudge him a few extra dollars  You got lucky and chimed in on a good project in its early days and are now  what  x14  So good for you and your early bag bro Do we have an update on this It was briefly fixed on Exodus  but now it s back with a slightly different error message   Previously you couldn t buy  sell  transfer  or exchange   Now you just can t exchange it You can get it on binance in pro mode you need to convert from usdt Still the same  getting really annoying now STEP finance is just a dashboard  Why is it worth  3 50  I want this to be successful but please explain what other utility this has than just being a dashboard Cool  lots of smaller stakes  Very decentralised Solana is already faster  cheaper    what would it take to do this   Hypothetically speaking Yes  its preventing u from panic sells  At the end we all know that Solana and more Coins will rise up and bring us the stash   P Ditto  it s actually nicer not keep having to look at it  except to see how much the stake has earned  and wondering if I should exchange to something else all the time Cheers buddy I ll do some research and let u know  x no offense taken since your unable to clarify FTX Any solution that has your funds on the Ledger are secure  Your keys are only on the Ledger and no matter if the PC or phone is hacked noone can steal them as all transactions need to be signed with physical button press Personally I use all of these different wallets   sites   Moonlet for monitoring SOL stake progress   rewards  Solflare for managing SPL token balances  Raydium for swapping between currencies  Serum Dex for trading  Solana CLI for tax reports for SOL staking  FTX for FIAT  lt   gt  Crypto conversions and for FTT staking  moonpay com for small top ups with credit cardFTX is easier to use and they make reports available  if you go with ledger it is more secure  under your control  but somewhat more cumbersome If you go with ledger  make sure to have that paper backup in a good location  It is your only backup if the ledger breaks or gets stolen  It is hackerproof as long as you never hold it into a camera or type it into a PC   phone Really appreciate it thanks a lot   which one is the safest one in your opinion For staking SOL with ledger  on the Mac PC you can use brave chrome and then solflare com  gt  access a wallet  gt  using ledger  gt  recommended derivation path  gt  root account to log in to the wallet  receive your funds from binance   ftx  and to delegate stake  On iPhone you can use the Moonlet app  then use the  connect  button to connect to ledger nano X via bluetooth  then stake through the app  It s the same wallet than recommended derivation path   root account in solflare on the browser  On Raydium io if you log in with connect to ledger it is also accessing that same wallet  For DEX  raydium only support sollet io wallet and sollet uses different derivation path when connecting to ledger  so would go through dex projectserum com instead which supports direct ledger log in SOL staking rewards on chain are around 7 8   dont trust the 11 12  on the website  no validator hits that   SOL staking rewards on FTX com are 10  but they control your keys For export to tax authorities  install Solana command line interface and then type  solana stake account YOUR STAKE ACCOUNT  to get a nice little tabular report  If you withdraw your stake account sometimes the report gets deleted so make sure to export before you withdraw Also  some of the sites require  allow blind sign  to be ON in the solana app settings on the ledger itself  Sometimes this randomly resets to off  Just in case you get random errors  Also  Firefox is hit or miss with Solana  would go with Brave Chrome I have ledger thanks a lot I m honestly not sure  to be honest mate  I think it s so high just because they re the new DEX and it s incentivised  As far as I know there is no risk involved but I could be completely wrong  They are based on Serum and I used Raydium a lot and they are very smooth to use  A lot of people think they could become quite large  If you find anything about risk though let me know I d be interested to know that myself Bruh I don t want to sound like a dick  but every content marketer sets a compelling headline to gain more attention  It s clearly not about the content anymore  I would suggest you start your investigation again to find the honest answer Good man   thsnk you  Guess ima dig deep looking into this shit haha  I am seeing 47  stake possibilities for ray     wtfffffGimme gimme  Oh ya and Fuck the taxes we are never withdrawing fiat I dont know if RAY is problematic in the US  Just know some coins are  and also know that US is a tax nightmare when it comes to crypto as every convert from one crypto to another is a taxable event  When you have daily harvests of staking rewards  have fun keeping track of those  Basically  with any new crypto  do your own research to avoid getting in trouble If FTX us lists it  maybe go through them as they also should have nice reporting  But at least on international FTX com you only get 20  instead of 45  APR on RAY Fuck  Why is my country so sus  Do you know if hodling and then in future if it s legal if that ape method wouldWork   Thank you by the way Be careful in the US  Lots of coins are not legal there  if they classify as unregulated security  SRM for example you should not touch in the US  not sure about RAY  Maybe check FTX us and Binance us whether they list RAY to have an indicator about those coins  Otherwise you may end up making a nice balance but will run into problems when you try cashing out Thank you my dude     Much appreciated   I live in Cali guess I ll be copping a vpn why is cardano trash I apologize if I mistaken  crypto research is often confusing  can you kindly elaborate so i can get the details accurate plz thx for the info 42  APY    sounds like a risky coin or am I wrong Hahah yeah  I have a ledger on the way to stop myself day trading as well  P  Not sure if you have used Raydium DEX but you can earn 42  APR thereby converting some of your SOL to RAY  Just thought I would let you know FTX is better for Solana  Serum and so on  I believe the founder is the same Same here  I bought Solana and I can t move it away from Binance  I want to stake it and be done with it  This has been stuck there for more than 24h by now  That s no ordinary server maintenance https   ftx com  a 17298457  https   ftx com  a 17298457 Also created my account to deposit SOL There will be staking delegation to validators How much should we encourage this type of content in our communitiy   I vote no Hi going to try FTX  I m Dad I m going to try FTX what the different between binance and FTX  are FTX is Better than binance  thankk you Are you sure  It s still blocked on Binance Same problem     https   imgur com a zwA0RcD  https   imgur com a zwA0RcD We have to waitStill  it s odd that Binance would block withdrawals from a competing cryptocurrency to BNB  right Hey there  We are building just that with  phantom app  https   phantom app  DM me and I ll get you an invite code He deleted an interview where he said the exact same thing from the intro in another place  but I remember and know who he is   Solid dude  nuff said What is your Address if you don t mind to see it s earning or not Check your Address in Solana Explorer   https   explorer solana com  https   explorer solana com     you ll see your earnings there Thank you  Solflare has been sucking ass with Ledger X  It just doesn t work An automated market maker for Solana Defi For the name of God  what is Ray That happened to me initially but worked fine after I sent over some sol for fees  Not sure what your issue might be unfortunately Solution  don t ever click through to YouTube videos from reddit   I  never  do   If someone can t write what they want to say on a text discussion forum  so that I can read it  since that s  you know  why I m using a text discussion forum  then I m just not interested Dude is gonna be rich  l Yup  that did it  Thank you Nah i need an ALGO dex first If solana hits ethereum s current market cap that means it would 30x from here  That means it would get to  1500  If you assume the crypto market grows 10x as a whole over the next few years then if it replaces ethereum AND that happens it s old be worth  15000  Unlikely to happen obviously  I think the layer ones are going to hit a blood bath in the next few months and we ll see who comes out ahead  Ethereum is still the most likely because it s the biggest but Solana punches above it s weight class Why buy on Binance when you can go all in on FTX Bullish My coins locked on their platform too  Been months THIS is how crypto adoption happens More like a clickbait   if you watch the vid jason says In fact solana works WITH Ethereum instead of replacing or killing it Either way i really doubt if anything  even ada  can  kill  eth I m not from US Pump  raydium sirThe dex of Solana I m not from US as i mentioned in another comment  i only saw one post get immediately deleted  that doesnt even mean it was the mods as im always deleting my comments posts  it was more of a thought to the sub Can you explain like I m 5  how I can attain ray thats a great policy I m not from US Fr supposed to get mine in june but ive waited 2 months so far What s your address you handsomeSon of a gun  I m contributing idk i simply saw  one  post get immediately removed so i cannot say  it was more of a shout from a new community member to the mods Most important thing is that Sol seems to have what it takes to survive the next bear market  After that  price target of  1500 alongside some other thriving layer 1s Awesome choice  I will skip ADA ETH DOT and all those hooo haa type of project Quality counts and Solana is it 2 more qualify projects are NENGcoin and Cheetahcoin which allows people over the world to get 10k coins each successful mine using android phone Pretty solid  I think they can really change the world to help more poor people around the world Imagine  10k each mine on phone is going to change lives of many Keep spotting quality projects  You are on spot BINANCE US Why are you accusing them of deleting critical posts  They have nothing to hide and are open to having a transparent community  Please provide an example so they may refute it Likely true  But you know what they say  People don t give you millions upon millions of dollars and not want anything in return Yeah look at the amount staked  it ll change I m glad your shitty fucking token is crashing  this thing has no purpose other than the LP farming when it first dropped which has now gone to shit  but mainly I m glad the coin is crashing based on how bad you guys handled the public sale I hear you  still learning and a lot of this hard to conceptualize  Someone suggested ftx and im blown away by how easy it was to use  Thank you Hello  so I have same issue  My sol are still blocked  Any advice on how to fix this It seems it s not verification but people have found the same problem All I can read is this meme which from my point of view states  Finance step with up step   Seems like a bad omen Your post has been

verification level are you on You might need to verify your account further I transferred some a few days ago from binance Is the address correct etc i can sell but i dont want to sell it   i want to transfer my solanas to another place different then binance and that is suspended Excellent decision Oh seriously you can t sell or transfer SOL to an external address no i mean withdrawing SOL to any other wallet or exchange i can sell too Oh do you mean withdrawing FIAT to your bank account Hell yeah Im on int binance too and binance withdrawal is suspended SOL is best project You must be on binance us the worst exchange I can buy and sell SOL on the international binance all day every day  Never had an issue at all 19yo here  dropped 2k I made from doge  I belive in this more than a meme currency  hopefully I don t regret this Well done    if I knew what I know now and made these type of moves when I was 18 I would have been a multi millionaire Do you believe that critical posts are

2021-05-07,43.50265476,46.05956397,41.43837305,Thank you  This is just horrible content and doesn t provide value to anybody  Literally put a single highlighted line on a long term chart and calls it research  ‍ ️ and y all wonder why normal people are scared to dip their toes in the space Oxy ray FTW LP step usdc  media usdc on raydium  Not financial advise right  crypto is supposed to moon exactly after you get bag   it s unequivocal science bro i definitely would not mind catching a 10x lol  im using some profits from that dumbass doge shit  i knew nothing about it  got a group text from one of the biggest idiots i know who said throw a couple hundred in when it was at 8 cents  totally just got lucky siphoned a ton of the profits into eth and sol  projects i actually feel good about  and good about holding   i think more and more people are going to realize the potential of sol in the next couple months  here s to hoping I think you have the most important ones covered  I ve had some good returns staking Serum on chain  I m also into Oxy but that s mostly speculative it went down afterwards  I was down almost 50   now up more than 10x  holding for at least another 10x I m expecting 1000000000x gains in 2 days whenever I invest Buyin 45 my neighbor suggested i look into it in april and i bought immediately after researching  wish i had known about this project last august This is such bs I ve only almost doubled my money on the last month with SOL   WTF hurry up and make it 3x smh  s Trading Volume dropped a lot  Market Cap not so much  it s a good sign Oh SOL is going to surge soon  It consolidated like this historically I ve seen nothing but gains for months on end while holding this coin  I m very content with hodling for a bit Why though  Why do all you crypto maximalists have to be so pretentious  It s obnoxious OK  Thank you Use a different wallet  try Solong or Math Wallet   Sollet has a disgusting UI UX   Solong is my favorite so far   This 2 are comparable to metamask I have never opened a  main  sollet account before  if I have to do this first  how and where do I do that  Thanks It s easier to add the sollet chrome extension but click the wallet on the top right and make sure it s connected to your main Sollet account and not another provider Thats why I m posting this  Go to Raydium and click staking  Connect your wallet and add  RAY  That s it I ve not figured out staking   liquidity providing on Raydium  or anywhere  yet   Do you have any good explainers It will take time till that Beta tag is removed  Does that   Beta   Tag make Solana less performing  The answer is simply no Bugs found so far are minors  amp  doesn t affect the Solana performance  so we re good  gt  every system that launches on solana is somewhat buggy and just beta on it too  That s not related to Solana blockchain itself  it s linked to the dApps  Solana s role is to provide the basis for those dApps  which it did already   amp  up to them to make the best out of their dApps 11 ppl upvoted this shitpost Bro you re sleeping lol  We got a whole defi out here   you don t know Gate io will list Step Finance STEP  https   www gate io en article 20662

Twitter Solana is a layer 1 chain with its own ecosystem  Raydium ioSerumBonfida Nice and thank you very much  You see a lot of KIN supporters there and it is very good to see your point of view as well  Maybe other validators can also hopp into the discussion to find a good solution for the involved parties  Thanks again Did you enable the blind settings in the ledger solana app I had a similar issue and it was solved by this option Just go on your ledger click solana go to options and enable it Thank you for all the comments   I think one comment that keeps coming up is  chill  it s been doing great    yes it has  and I picked up the bulk of my coins at  2 and  8   but I am looking at recent price developments and what s going on  It doesn t take much for something to deflate if there are issues  It seems like Binance was the main culprit which is clearly reassuring  But as this is a market driven by sentiment  I am trying to gauge said sentiment  When I see us drop every day by market cap   it s not pleasant  I am HODLing but not adding at this point  It s all on solflare and the pain of de staking and moving on binance and back into kraken and then into fiat is enough of a pain for me to do it Thanks for the pointer to that post on the Solana Forum   Interesting read and makes some interesting points   I responded to that post in the Solana Forum buy and hodl till you re 22  you ll easily be a lambo owner Great idea  I feel like this  r Solana has gotten way too overcrowded with hodlers and memers posting low quality stuff that drowns out the dev stuff I m used to seeing here  Subbed Can we not have these low quality posts in here please I think the same  SOL BTC is going down like in March You got a YouTube channel Return to 38 and below that 30 seems likely  SOL had a hell of a runup  I think correcting for now You have to own 10usd minimum I bought some SOL last August  I had no clue what was to come   SOL is a hurricane and this wasn t even the start  Should have bought much more If you want moon look for short term pump and dump Solana is for the long term  it s a solid project  it s not for quick profit  but there may be phases where it happens You re probably wrong  it might do all three it is in development  hopefully it will be released soon Thank you for the help so far  I tried to follow this but it shows no funds to send from the Token Address  3k8B     This is the address I accidently sent to in my sollet wallet from FTX   The delete button comes up after I put     localStorage setItem  warning close account   true     in the console   do I need to click delete before the next step  I am worried this will delete them for good  Any help is appreciated at this time I m in a pickle gt 1  Why is this a problem on Solana and not the other blockchains  Real world usage  solana needs to support at least a billion ppl and web3 apps transacting everyday  gt 2  How do I create a new wallet on Solana Depends how good you are with computers https   docs solana com wallet guide Coin perspective is a good site to understand realistic price movements  Will market cap be larger than Ethereum by EOY  Who knows  but it is a useful reference point to understand what the price would have to be I think I see sectors of NFT booming too  And even artwork might have it s place but only NFTs of more famous artists Thank you for your response   https   forums solana com t proposal to adjust the logic of the solana rent program to be responsive to the price of sol 1572  https   forums solana com t proposal to adjust the logic of the solana rent program to be responsive to the price of sol 1572 This is the proposal the Kin Foundation made  I think they have two main points  the volatility of the price and the high cost for onboarding  I don t know enough about the validators or the technical background of Solana  even though i understand the basics and how the rent concept is working  So i think  others are better in discussing such things  I want to just add two points    It would be possible to see the 99 999  of KIN tokens also from another perspective  00 001  doesn t matter  I know  there are lots of great projects built on Solana and of course everybody matters     Usually it is always all about the money  So how many on boardings are needed in order to avoid any financial loss for the validators  The Kin Foundation wrote they are regularly in contact with companies with one  ten and even more million users  At the end it might be not as easy as that  but given the fact  that KIN is in a good position to negotiate with mainstream companies to introduce crypto to huge user bases  i think everybody would win Thanks a lot Now are all Tokens in my Binance wallet  Thanks god Thanks The primary function for rent is to prevent network spam  If there was no such thing anyone could create countless wallets clogging the network  I have 2 follow up questions related to this 1  Why is this a problem on Solana and not the other blockchains  2  How do I create a new wallet on Solana so we will have to suffer 100  drop 1 more time This is no different to 2013 Huh Unknown token address won t show up like that  it s most probably the LP token address of a token you re Staking somewhere in the Solana Ecosystem  Raydium  Srrum  BonFida      If you didn t do any Staking  then it s probably an

be healthy to retrace to 35 to 37 as its growth was parabolic haha hell yeah my g Yeah  I believe there is a game being built that will feature NFT s  I think artwork NFT s are a bit of a short term gimmick personally  They aren t like trading cards where over the years become more scarce and more impressive with the condition they are in  But I do see a place for things like VeChain NFT and NFT in games will be huge No I am entirely agreeing w you  I didn t mean to sound blunt either my bad haha just eth competitor perhaps is better   but honestly it doesn t matter I just realized I m on some middle school shit to bicker w that lol SOL IS GOAT Eth is Bae Pathetic for Sol at the current stage   ‍ ️ ‍ ️Can t do much except to wait for a rally but please do run if it breaks down It s more fun to think the conspiracy route    It s been disabled for the past three days on my end  longer than normal server maintenance Happening on Binance US for me too  Binance Smart Chain getting jealous of a little Solana competition Is the locked staking on Binance for SOL still there  I don t see anymore Do you like free crypto  Then stake lol Dnt stake on binance bro I was about to say this  convert some to RAY brother  Making more then fucking modern day banks on this shit Man people really need to listen to advice before investing in crypto  Its like a wave  you get a jacked up pump and then you get a dip for awhile  When you buy something like solana its not a day trade coin  plan to hold for at least a year or two  Where my SOLdiers at There are 14 validators in SouthEast Asia so there s definitely interest and your 100  right just staked on solflare  and immediately found staking and farming on raydium after lo  it seems to have much higher APYs WHERE MY SOLDIERS AT Yeah  I could tell you had some class  Then again  you are in the Solana sub  so I should have already known  I look forward to connecting in 6 months RemindMe  6 months Ew bro  can t fit the kids in one of those Either your transaction went through and you haven t settled it  or the price of your limit order didn t hit and you have an open order that needs to be canceled  Go to the balances tab of the Serum dex and click  settle all I don t see a lot of people interested in selling their Solana  and didn t see any of what seem pump  amp  dump like the other coins either  I also like how the people doing the tech focus on creating ops for developers  to build awesome stuff I don t like ultra amtheur stuff like STEP  which are in some way endorsed  to tarnish the image of Solana  I hope STEP can STEP it up  because people have long memory when they trust a source pseudo endorsing that turns out very bad Set up your Sollet wallet and get on Raydium exchange  Very smooth  and SOL has extremely low gas fees If you re using the dex  then it s possible you didn t settle your funds and that s why it s not showing up I understand it  It s basically rewarding ppl on Twitter for being accurate on their crypto predictions and stuff  So it s a rlly cool concept but then again that doesn t necessarily mean it will moon Binance is finicky with everything to be honest  But you can swap sol for usdt on step finance  But in my opinion I would just keep what sol you have and slowly accumulate more usdt usdc and what for a big dip and snatch up coins at a discount Soon I ve been using step  and I have an unknown token in my wallet after providing liquidity to a pool  I m assuming it s the LP token but I ve not confirmed this yet  If it is  I would love to stake it but once again  I haven t confirmed what it is just yet That s not a useful post   That s a link to a website I m not so sure Solana should reduce rent   I ve been told by a dev that the vast  vast majority of storage on the Solana network right now  they said 99 999   is KIN tokens   That is the heaviest use of Solana data storage and so it should be no surprised that it has the most significant rent Rent isn t really paid for most accounts anyway  they simply have to keep a rent exempt minimum balance   The rent exempt minimum SOL is not gone  it is returned to the user when they close the account Yeah thanks for the insight  I m going to check out solfarm as well There is very little rent paid   Most accounts are rent exempt  if you keep a balance above a small minimum  you never pay rent   And almost all accounts are above that balance   So I would say that rent rewards are of incredibly minor importance Lol  I m just glad you didn t say Lambo I am 14 That s a big call  But hey if it happen I ll come pick you up in my private jet and we can celebrate  RemindMe in 6 months  Pick Panda up in private jet if his call is on point  if not he owes me a tesla Yes me to  WTF 100 would only be about  25B mcap  BNB is currently   100B  for reference  I am calling for  360 SOL by the end of this bull cycle There was some speculation that they were holding user funds to have them included in the epoch stake snapshot so they would earn staking rewards for the next five days on withdrawn funds   since the  maintenance  was suspiciously close to epoch boundaries a few times  This is just speculation though  Cardano doesn t have bonding locking of staked funds so it s uniquely vulnerable to this issue Yea  love this I like these reminders frequently Wen moon Every epoch which is about 2 half days By Ether killer I mean I think Solana will one day be the bigger one   that doesn t mean Ether won t be far below us  Ethereum will continue to hit new all time highs for the next year or two  I don t think everyone will recode over to layer 2 though and it will lose its place on top So by ether  killer  you don t mean ether  killer  Should use dif terminology lol solflare Have you tried a simple   Ctrl f5   and try again Sometimes a simple   Refresh   solution will do it Ensure you have enough Solana for Gas Fee  0 001SOL is enough amp  x200B I have some BTC on binannce 0

look at the volume not too many ppl buying rn I hope a lot of it has something to do with high volumes of new users all of a sudden  or possibly user error   I just withdrew my VET  amp  didn t have a problem  Would love to get my 6 Solana out soon I caught myself being like   hmmm when Sol gonna get some traction  All spoiled   not remembering how recently it was sub 10  lol I  lt 3 Sol    it s price is staying very strong indeed Because solana is goat FTX us doesn t work in NY anything other then FTX us  for NY résidents Yes  I ve seen that notice  You have to wait about 10 days but I had my friend check his SOL withdrawal too and it s deactivated as well so maybe they re doing maintenance I just started looking up all those issues  You weren t kidding But it s gonna stop you out before making that move Anyone know where I can buy  sol living in the US so far I havnt found on metamask or anything I mainly use coinbase but they have the barely minimum available to buy I thought a single place where everything is accessible and people don t have to ask the same questions again and again would be great By Ether killer I don t mean ETH will be no more   ETH will always be in the picture for sure  that s why I got a large bag of both XD There is the  Solana Discord  https   discord com invite pquxPsq  of course  don t know if you re there or not   but if you feel Reddit is better for you  go ahead  good luck Hi there  is it possible that you purchased less than 10 days ago  According to the Binance terms and conditions once you deposit money or directly purchase cryptocurrency  you cannot withdraw it for 10 days  This means a transfer or withdrawal  You can sell it back to cash if you want  and then  it sit there in cash  but no matter what you have to wait 10 days Hey  which wallet is this I think some are missing the point because even though it s a bull market  Solana is spectacular as a technology and will continue to bloom with innovation  Because of this  looking at just this bull market is quite short sighted  I really think regularly getting SOL and staking is where it s at If you re not smart enough to use a VPN then yes binance does not

chrome I think Ethereum has been around for six years  since 2015   Its current market cap is   400B  I believe Solana will outperform Ethereum in its first six years because of its superior tech while Ethereum is struggling to scale  Even if it only matches Ethereum s growth  bringing Solana s fully diluted market cap to  400B   it will represent a 20X growth from its current price  Solana is

might be different  We are seeing huge adoption and real world uses so this isn t just hype like last time Yeah I mean Raydium still has alot of room to grow  Amount of money locked is increasing exponentially Lunna is huge in southeast Asia  The adoption is there with the Chii app  Solana is being adopted at a huge rate faster than any other crypto  We will be top 5 in no time If you sign up

AVAX from binance to my ledger wallet and I wasnt allowed  stated avax network was  suspended  but no other explanation at all   Very unsettling for a noob like me  I was not a fan of binance before cuz of its centralization but i liked its reliability but with what happened yesterday my concerns have grown  I want to buy solana but I wont use binance I will use CDC instead Oooh   interesting Okay  I will take a look soon Tks  I could never figure it out  but thankfully I was able to move funds to another wallet  then to ledger tks Appreciate your effort but he is wrong Buy your Solarians

it for me but its the token only to give to winners of predictions and then they sell or does it have any funtionality How is an amateur reading a chart and advising people to hold a scam No  disliking scams is not maximalism Is this not the definition  You re saying you want YOUR crypto to only be shown in a particular light   It s so holier than thou I d rather see posts like this  than the constant barrage of posts about missing coins  exchanges not working correctly  staking not working correctly  etc But it is already launched on Terra blockchain     so they are also launching a different one on Solana   doesnt that divide the pool of lender funds   Isnt it better to pool the lenders in one place Yes  you can keep SOL and any other tokens on the Solana blockchain   It also supports a plethora of other blockchains tokens   It really doesn t matter what wallet you use  as long as you re able to restore the wallet w  a private key or seed phrase Thats great to hear  In the past y made trading with all this other Coins but now iam 100   with Solana  They have great Projetcts  Thats the Future  Lets go Thanks  Can you keep sol tokens on Mathwallet Well that s bullish I

beautiful green candle How is it crypto maximalism to not want the sub to be turned into a boiler room Cryptocurrency is not affected by quarterly results nor company news  The only turn off is the technicals and periodic harvesting by big whales and big sharks  If they aren t interested to rally and push  you and me are just like sitting ducks waiting to be shot at  Technically  the cruise is about to depart however  I am surprised as well as baffled as to where the hot money actually goes to  instead of here in SOL Pyth Solfarm is just another smart contract protocol onto of raydium  Raydium is manual harvest  Solfarm is auto compound yield aggregator Take a look at kin  It runs on the Solana chain and has a promising ecosystem and leadership behind them  The vision is there if it can be pulled off you know The same two LP s on SolFarm also pretty nice My team and I are competing in the Solana Hackathon on May 15th  we have started to develop our idea around NFTs in a non  traditional  way  Check us out we d love feedback r MintmeSOL Check out kreechures  They are s new nft game in the kin ecosystem  You train monsters and in the future you ll be able to battle with others I swapped to RAY and put it on RAY USDT LP farm Do you think this is a good move I use these dashboard aggregatorsApe dashboard StepSonar watch Sonar shows my earnings  Try em all Why  This is a HIGH quality post and it reflects reality  Solana is going sideways while every other crypto is rising  So what  hold Gotcha but how do you see the earning  Is it only when you convert the lp Pretty sure u don t earn LP  Could be wrong  Also Raydium dictates what u earn  In STEP USDC you earn step or USDC In media u earn media or usdc etc Can I ask a dumb question  When I put lp in do my lp tokens increase after fees and then also I farm those for separate raydium correct
2021-05-08,43.15206692,46.63902655,42.29801778,You got it Ah yes I read that  Basically you just stale when you can  or near the end of the current epoc  as it won t be  activated  until the new epoc begins Solana can explain it much better than I can ever      here you go lol amp  x200B  Source   https   solana com staking timing  https   solana com staking timing When you delegate or un delegate a stake account  the tokens do not change state immediately  Newly delegated tokens are considered  activating  or  warming up   and are not eligible to earn rewards until they are fully activated  Newly un delegated tokens are considered  deactivating  or  cooling down  and are not able to be withdrawn until deactivated The Solana protocol only allows stake tokens to finish changing state at the beginning of a new epoch  An epoch is approximately 2 days long  Use   solana epoch info   to see details of the current epoch If you delegate tokens in a stake account in the middle of an epoch  the tokens will appear in your wallet as  activating  until the current epoch ends  at which point they will be active and eligible to earn rewards  Whether you delegate your stake tokens near the beginning of the current epoch  or near the end of the current epoch does not impact when the tokens will become active  which is only at the next epoch boundary  The same logic applies to un delegating or deactivating a delegated stake account  Deactivating tokens cannot be withdrawn until they have finished deactivating at the epoch boundary Explain  Both times I believe it was still epoc 178  It won t activate until new epoc begins correct Good way to get Raydium and SRM etc   if you have some SOL and USDC in your Solana wallet  Phantom  Sollet  etc    is to just swap USDC for Raydium SRM Oxy STEP whatever else on Raydium Was Solanas epoch  try to do your best to not stake during the epoch I think a lot will depend on how gas fees play out with the new Ethereum upgrades  If the price of Ethereum  in USD  keeps skyrocketing  gas fees might become progressively more prohibitive and that might spur some people to use alternatives I staked some more two days ago  and everything was completed from wallet transfer to delegated in approximately 7 10mins  So whatever was gumming up the system two days ago  seems to have been resolved Yes Seems unlikely at this moment  but then again half a year ago it was unlikely that Doge would be nr  4 crypto in market cap so who knows  ‍ ️ No reason they can t coexist Possible reasons 1   You re Sending your MAX SOL  Try to subtract 0 000005 SOL for fees  2   You can enable the blind signing setting Binance com   you can fund it through another exchange like Newton or Ndax if need be never I recently used  stealthex  https   stealthex io    It doesn t require KYC  you just send ETH BTC others and swap for SOL  or many other tokens   I sent some ETH over  spent about  4 in gas fees  then the SOL transaction took  lt 5c and I was good to go  I was slightly suspicious about the site but it ended up working just fine  I did notice in the FAQ they mention they sometimes will KYC check so I m not sure if they do that based on IP location  Might want to read it through for yourself Solana also has a wormhole for ETH  Allegedly it s live according to the  website  https   solana com wormhole  but I can t find the actual place to swap for the life of me  If you can find any more information let me know I took my funds out of Exodus  I have a bad feeling about it  I use Trust Wallet Apart from xrp it was easy for me   binance US  now serum and rayduim are impossible to get I needs to move  But I think it will sit at  30 for a while I was hoping for a 300  at end of 2021 but its not gonna happen gonna have to sit on it and hope it doesn t tank to hard in the winter Also  any advice on how to do it with the very limited options I m working with in as few steps as possible  again  newish here  would be greatly appreciated This kid kind of my problem  In NY it s even harder than the rest of the US to buy SOL  I just got into crypto  and my friend immediately told me get into Solana  but trying to figure out how to buy it without paying half in transfer fees is nuts  And please save the  get a VPN  responses  That s fucking useless when  exchanges won t let you withdraw without some kind of KYC being done Yea or give a more clear error explaining what exactly went wrong Good analysis right here Because you don t make funny doge memes  So the kids can t get involved Look doge coin is an evil we needed  Its shown that alt coins have a market now  Btc and eth are no longer untouchable  Its opened the way for coins like solana  And unfortunately about 300 forks of doge I am not a database specialist or a smart contract developer  so I am treading on treacherous ground here  That said  from what I read on the Dfinity site  it seems to address the transaction speed challenge by splitting application calls into two types  update calls and query calls  So  there speed sounds like it may depend on the design of the smart contract and how often it needs to be updated  Perhaps designing an app from scratch may be best able to take advantage of the technology  If so  where does this leave legacy smart contracts built on other blockchain networks   If it does mean starting from scratch  that is a headwind in terms of adoption Maybe I am looking at this incorrectly   Here is what the  Dfinity FAQ  https   dfinity org faq   says about transaction speeds    gt Chain Key Technology allows the Internet  Computer to finalize transactions that update smart contract state in  1 2 seconds  This is an enormous improvement  but still insufficient  alone to allow blockchain to provide competitive user experiences  which  require that responses be provided to users in milliseconds  The  Internet Computer solves this by splitting smart contract function  execution into two types  known as  update calls  and  query calls    Update calls are those we are already familiar with  and take 1 2  seconds to finalize their execution  while query calls work differently  because any changes they make to state  in this case  the memory pages  of  canisters  https   dfinity org faq canisters   are discarded after they run    Essentially  this allows query calls to execute in milliseconds Sounds great  thanks Ledger might have just sent me some garbage Odd  I m not sure   If you re seeing SOL in the wallet  it should work   Perhaps some Googling to see if you find any solutions Ok thanks  Regarding the ledger I added some funds but I m still not able to add token accounts  It s says  ledger device error UNKNOWN It s hard to buy in the US and MY POINT EXACTLY no one talks about it and it s faster  cheaper  better than all the others You didn t save the original Solana wallet address somewhere  If you did  you should be able to verify you ve Imported the right wallet   If not  and you imported all the possible wallets with all the different derivation paths  then something else is wrong   Someone may have gotten your private key or seed phrase and took your funds To see if that s what happened  you could check the Solana block explorer for all the main wallet addresses you ve imported  and see if any of them have any transactions  that you haven t performed    If they do  it s likely the seed or private key was compromised If you find out the wallet was indeed compromised  I would create a new wallet with a new phrase   Also be sure to store your seed phrase  private key  and main wallet address some place safe   Also make note of the derivation path used to create the new account To add tokens to the ledger  you ll need to first fund the wallet with some SOL   Then you should be able to create addresses for different tokens This is a serious thought I ve had Why don t you buy a ton of SOL and hire yourself  If you do well  you ll get paid Yes  mine is on a desktop  You can try deleting and re installing the app  I know someone fixed the problem by doing so Which part Need to consolidate before a push  There is a flash spike most recently  Hopefully the frequency of the flash spike will occur and gradually increase in the next 48 hours There is always a technical rot when the time is up  If the big whales and big sharks hesitate  the opportunity will be missed and the next cycle will take a much longer time to ready itself Yes  this was enabled Me  too    Binance US  https   Binance US  stealing Sol coins   I

thanks  Exciting times If the amount you re swapping is small enough  relative to overall liquidity of a particular trading pair  when using the swap function  it ll get routed through the liquidity pool  If it s a larger order  then an aggregate of pool liquidity   traders MMs on the book will provide the liquidity  The interesting thing about Serum and Raydium is that they each provide liquidity to each other as opposed to being isolated raydium s Curious to learn more about your team and idea They ll need to send a new one Because I don t want Solana discussion to be 100  fueled by

should buy at  25 Just for clarification  the funding comes from the foundation  right No  it s never happened FTT is not related to a blockchain like sol  bnb or eth  You can think it as a share stock of Ftx exchange which is a centralised and run on web servers  Every week trading fees that Ftx collect is used to buy and burn ftt tokens  This ensures that there is constant demand for it as

 but it is listed on FTX US Sol withdrawal was turned off yesterday for me as well Isn t Sollectify the answer here  It s brand new I think stupid What s the difference between DeFi llama and DeFi Pulse TVL stats Happened to me  Refresh your wallets on both sides Exodus hasn t been working well with SOL last few days Have you contacted them about it That s what I m using actually  It s just dead  I think it doesn t macOS  Anyway I m just going to use Sollet  But there also I can t add tokens to the account attached to my ledger  I can add sols but not tokens  Any help on that Likely the problem  however I do feel the fee would be better automatically taken  I like the whole Solana ecosystem but little usability things like this are no good for the average user I didnt I say  believed anything   any technology can be surpassed  Ive seen that info on transactions   I just saw Hedera just passed ethereum transaction volume and most on financial news that talk blockchain or crypto would not know that so if Solana   is comparable they dont know about their performance either I can be mad at this  every coin needs hype and speculation  just like every outperforming financial assets currency  This is literally what happens on Bloomberg   CNBC all day  only difference is that the people on the screen wear suits I m getting fomo on this project and thinking of laddering in  Y all think that s a fail move at this price  everything is moving so fast today  Good luck all Im waiting for iOS Ver Same for me  Transferred a few days ago  Managed to get hold of support  Apparently it s some change that Solana made that s caused the issue  They are working on it 24 7 to get fixed i use Binance US too but i get nervous when they turn off deposits and withdrawals randomly  im moving everything over to Exodus as soon as I can  At least ill have my own private keys  Having too much money in an exchange makes me nervous There s a web extension for it you can use   I would try importing the seed words using all the different paths  and checking the balance each time until you find one that has a balance   Then you know you found the right derivation path That is on a desktop right  Not the app Yes  if you believe two coins are relatively worth the same  you have faith ANY mix of them will be good  then yes  But remember  you are giving away the right to make the most money  as if two coins don t grow proportionally in value you are always worse by having offered them as liquidity  unless the fee makes up the difference  which we could calculate for all liquidity pools  and would show the staggering amount of loss that is now permanent  A corollary is that there should be different FEES   per pair  based on a formula that considers the Beta  volatility  of the coins and the correlation between them  What is exactly a fair formula is yet to be developed  Right now  one can consider the baseline and  risk free  liquidity fee but be that of a stablecoin pair  which is between 3  to 10   And that s for a largely risk free one  This won t happen anytime soon  because most people suppling liquidity have no idea how they are being taken advantage of  and that they are doing a poor choice  So there s free liquidity for all kinds of coins for fees that are a steal  But they show this misleading APY and people that suplly them think they will get that APY and some maybe temporary loss that will self correct  This makes things even worst  because they leave the liquidity longer  waiting for the miracle to happen I am planning to hold USDC and other token anyways  I am just confused whether its better to provide liquidity in these paired pools or instead put USDC on pancakcebunny  average returns 30   and just hold the other token  if token moves up or down a lot I will experience some IL  its a bullish market   expect the market to go up  But at the same time  the trading turnover is quite high which generates good trading fees   I guess it s not that easy to quantify the returns on LP NEW COIN NEW AIRDROP  SOLANIUMHello new airdrop and withlist on Solana ecosystem   SOLANIUM   Get free tickets for win  SLIM

usdc anyways  You ll sell more of the coin on the way up and have imp loss vs if you just held the coin  But that s why farm fusion rewards will try to offset that potential  as well as price risk   I agree with OP that the farming yield chasing is unsustainable but providing liquidity as a concept shouldn t necessarily be looked down upon The meme is Samoyedcoin Same thing for me   It s been so many days  I think we just have to wait what if one of them is USDC The position makes more sense if you were already going to hold those two tokens regardless of ratio   Impermanent loss is not as big of a deal if you don t have a super clear thesis on exactly what the market is going to do  You believe in the two tokens  and think they are both going to go up  but you don t know which ones will go up more and when  You buy them at certain points in time and now instead of having it just sit there you want to put them to work  The fees  and extra rewards  should cover your position and more It s weird I did choose the right path  But there s no balance  only the address  Does MacOs support math wallet 100 000 Also you can share your problem on discord  I m sure someone from their team will help    https   discord gg FF6PMrHy  https   discord gg FF6PMrHy     Serum   https   discord gg zufjbgGN  https   discord gg zufjbgGN     Phantom Oxy   is trash and basically unusable at this point  hence why price has been stuck at 3 for so long  serum  I don t really get what your saying  what dex did you try buying on  I use the raydium dex and it s fine  switch to usdc markets those are more liquid  Ray  you probably don t have enough sol in your wallet for the gas fee  instead of pressing max on the sol part just try to swap the 9 sol for however many ray  gas is cheap on solana but you still need some in your wallet to confirm a tx I m using Raydium and Serum dex on daily basis and no problem whatsoever  also using phantom wallet    I m not sure what is the problem  but make sure that you always have at least a small amount of SOL left in the wallet  as you need to pay transaction with it   lt 0 5 SOL will be more than enough   make sure if you are using order book to settle funds after trading I didn t mean to hate on kin  What I should of said is we don t need a meme coin when we have kin  Alot of the appeal of meme coins early on is how cheap they are and how many you can get  We already have that and more with Kin  don t need a meme coin SHIBA INU made the creators now  3B in a month  and it s still trending up  The other  2B that s worth right new are mid winners  The vast majority will enter too late  a few of them will cut the loses  and many will go broken or penniless What happens to the Penniless  Note you don t need to get a coin to  0 to go broke  People usually don t talk about this to anyone  But most often  they have credit card debt  So unless they are net positive  they may lose everything even if not on margin  with some steep loss of 50  or number that varies by person Having lost everything  they will vote to kick the game board and whatever rules their society had  It is very dangerous what is going on  I applaud anyone making lots of money  It s not their fault  My worry is the consequences of this time of game are most always worst to all involved From 26June2020 till 24April2021  KIN went up 7 433    You may call it a meme token   KINs leadership may have mismanaged it in the past  and KIN may have had problems with like the SEC   However  out of all of that  they still have a real world use case  which 99 9  of coins and tokens out there do not have   I do not know the future of KIN  Solana  Cryptocurrency  or even the Earth for that matter   What I do know is that the way it currently sits  KIN has a crazy high future potential which is based on actual use and not some kind of meme speculation Did you select the right derivation path when importing the wallet why is the main comment

2021-05-09,45.61763117,47.1212139,43.29694489,No I agree  I intend to hire the guy I use for my stocks stuff he tells me what to do  It costs me like 100  but I d rather 100 and he does everything  Than free and I cock something up Ah I know you folks have different rules  I recommend looking into them before selling solana  Not saying you re wrong  but it s good to be certain The way the market is going after the first bull run early this year  it looks like we need a few more weeks of consolidation after a x4  But crypto isn t exactly something steady that you can predict  so who knows  I hope it blows up It s great to hear that you finally have your funds retrieved  Yeah I have just reached out the discord team and after some guidances I was able to retrieve my fund as well  The hours that I spent on the system tho would be enough to scare me away too Yea it s capital gain in the UK for most transactions  I think its if you do ss certain amount of trades  I m not quite sure  But Ive made no sales yet  I dropped my whole stock Portfolio last year and only did capital gains on that Its why I intend to buy again in April  After the tax return has been submitted  Its only if it exceeds 300  a coin before November  Tbh I m just nervous about keeping large amounts during the winter So I might sell some and keep half or something  But sol isn t a great deal  It s eth I have like 70  of my portfolio in Correlation is extremely high between these two compared to most others  I m sure there are others in this pattern too  though I don t know what the tax laws are where you live  but I try to avoid that with coins I plan on holding otherwise I count as a day trader and my gains are taxed the same as income and not capital gains I m to conflicted  I think if it s bellow 300  a coin  by end of this year I ll hold  But if it exceeds that I ll cash it and buy in again in April They all are similar haha  This is the overall trend of most alts right now I agree they will coexist  It s still wayyy too early to predict the winner  We re like 10  years away from that I manage  200k yr in digital adspend I guess it will be only in the next bull cycle  But nevertheless Sol Summer will be HUGE  If you Solanians don t know about the new Solanium Launchpad IDO and guaranteed airdrop yet  Take a look here   https   solanium io  code kZVrNs1A  https   solanium io  code

early  Yikes  https   twitter com rgr _park status 1386212803120353281 s 20 amp  x200B  Solanium Whitelist  https   solanium io  code kZVrNs1A Yes but he won t respond to someone like us COPE was doing one for airdrops It s a sales whitelist to enter lottery  for a chance for the  public  sale after the person shares their wallet  email  telegram  which actually means being hand picked  then verifying identity  all for a project that is all about enabling DECENTRALIZED FUNDRAISING platform on Solana try  step finance  https   step finance  with sollet wallet or  apeboard finance  https   apeboard finance  with your sol address Pretty smart So I was farming STEP USDC and sent that pair to my wallet  Restaked it with the unknown token and we re all good  Sorry for the bother Buy CAKE then stake it on  PantherSwap  https   pantherswap com  ref ewdqmekk5qjj1r7zqwemyz7vupaq76azkpd4u627d  while you are at it Omg that sucks  But yeah  I went onto the Solana discord server and after a couple of days of hitting dead ends someone was finally able to help  I have absolutely no idea what this means  but after I posted my public address and the transaction hash this guy said something along the lines of  oh yeah  looks like it s just an old market that hasn t been cranked in a while  Gimme a minute     then I literally waited a minute or two and he says  alright  try it now  and I logged into my Solflare wallet connected to solflare dex and I was immediately able to settle my funds and withdraw  Like I said  absolutely no fucking idea what he meant by this but he said someone needed to  crank  the market  I promise you I m not messing with you lol it s just something that happens on Solana and I have no idea what that is or how to do it  but you ll probably have to reach out to someone on the discord server so they can knock it loose  more or less  Was enough to scare me away from Solana for good and I m not even mad about the gains I missed after dumping it all at   25 After polkadot pumps and settles in It is easy to sell down SOL but difficult to push for the moon  I do urge big whales and big sharks to limit their harvesting so that substantive consolidations can take place  Rock the core pillars and you get weakened sentiments  Sustain and support the flash buying spikes  eventually  the flow of mass injections of funds will come It has been pretty stagnant these past 2 weeks In all seriousness  18 months from now Sollet Hu  Doge coin has a cap of 5billion a year  They ain t mining 5b a month Agreed  See my comment  Just noting that a huge break and 2x might be incoming I think SOL will outperform Theta  Bigger use case ecosystem better tech it has an unlimited supply and mines 5 billion coins a month  come on dude Been looking at these two charts since the first solana consolidation around 14 dollars  If it continues to play out solana should double pretty quickly here  However we re consolidating a bit longer up high  which is healthier for the parabolic trend and means we might end much higher than 2x from here Couldnt have said it better You can get loans backed by crypto and then use your loan tokens for leverage or whatever you want  This is highly capital efficient  Currently yield farming on Solana earning about 50  a day Getting onto matic layer 2 is like using a completely new chain  You have to move your eth to matic which costs eth  And use a new wallet  Honestly the same as going through the wormhole to solanas ecosystem  And solanas ecosystem is more robust than matic imo right now Yeah phantom should be really good when it releases Probs not right now because no one has coded a contract that does that  but it would be very easy to do imo Yes Solana is  as they say  an ethereum killer haha  Except it really is because for the first time  every problem with layer one decentralized blockchains was solved No other blockchain is using proof of history  Anatoly invented it and it is unique to this blockchain Same thing happened to me  Has your issue been solved  I have lost 380usdc in soleon due to the same issue that occurred  That s just too sad Thanks man  thanks for being a mod for this community The article implied to the foundation  not from it Thanks will do An unfriendly walker with a bad graphic design might have a good engine and just need a tweaking of the user interface Agree with that  Early stages still They said no  they are focusing on bigger things    gt  the ecosystem itself  BULLISHNESS Which Solana wallet you are referring to Huge fan of Solana  The sky is the limit for this project  It s amazing how fast the ecosystem is growing day by day  Solana will be a top 10 coin soon imo Patience men  Solana is going to be huge Don t disgrace Solana s subreddit by making it look like people who held doge are the investors of solana lol Personally Solana is still awesome to me  Many has hop to Cardano  it was in my list years ago  but I decided not to Notice that OP is posting their referral link though and only sharing this for their personal gain Thank you for the head up  I will take time to read the documents Yeah  well I just used zed run which runs on matic  and the gas fees are still outrageous  These projects all have a longggg way to go so do you view them as a stand alone project with the robustness of a Cardano or the Ethereum ecosystem  or as part of a interoperable group with other solutions  Also  is Solana the only one using PoH  I remember reading of another project using the protocol thank you for your help  i got them back now  i think it s hard to understand the relationship between Serum and STEP  RAY Thank you so much man  saved me too  I should never send Tx s whilst half asleep lmao  Thanks once again The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago  the 2nd best time is now I ve been staking with SolFlare for at least two weeks and haven t seen any returns as yet   I know some take a while  like Ada  and others are daily  like Cake on pancake swap  but I have no idea if I should leave my  SOL there or cut my losses I m delegated to StakeFish and reached out to them directly   Happy to keep y all posted   Any suggestions on how to better stake my sol would be immensely appreciated  ta Hadn t heard much about the Embody Well I don t think you re late for the long haul  The ecosystem and tech looks promising I hope so You can t stake on Sollet  and Solflare is not user friendly at all with a bad graphic design  Community needs a new wallet  there are many request from a lot of users I actually made the exact same play   Doge into SOL i stake all  SOL i am sure it will good competition for  ETH in future  it s after 3 years when I take some altcoin for a long time hold I m familiar with Aave  But what does that have to do with Polygon Sol is the only alt not getting rekt by eth past month or two I said facts bro  Articles  technical analysis  links  scans  even insider whistle blower stuff if you can substantiate it  You just gave out more opinion The point is not to overtake other networks  Most of the chain are working on interoperability  The plan is not to dominate each other  but rather co exist  Think in this way  Every chain has it s own use case  Each of them needs to exist to sustain their use case  There are upcoming projects which are favourable by most users and there are favourable chains which majority use  So new blockchain needs to adapt to entertain those users In case of Solana  the high tps and tx speed is what makes it special  This feature is more likely to be adopted by user institutions which require higher tx speed with reasonable cost Solana funded Phantom recently  Maybe their plan is to fund some devs making good wallets instead Sollet is basically the official wallet  It works perfectly fine and has chrome extension  Trust is the best mobile wallet imo I agree  Solana needs an  official  wallets made by the devs of the project  Easy to use  easy to stake  beautiful and very secure  Developers would eventually take inspiration from cosmostation app built for Cosmos crypto I thought the final use case of Solana and ETH is different no  Since I listen to the founder s interview and he keeps on talking about VISA and Matercard  so my impression was that he aims to be a decentralized day to day payment network or to facilitate a decentralized chat social media apps    If by DEFI you mean DEX then probably NEVER   As for my idea of DEFI  meaning offering what financial institutions are offering in a decentralized manner  then it is possible  Now it is still a very early stage where 99  of all the use cases are to move one coin around to get a better return elsewhere  Even though there is a lot of talk about DEFI displacing Banks but there is no real world loan with DEFI yet and we will have to wait and see Welcome man  glad it s solved  good luck SOLd my SOL to the devil for it at  13  rollin in bags of SOL now Absolute

trying another browser  he s using GoogleChrome  amp  tried Firefox which solved his problem I think this is where it s missing  I don t see the pop up windows  I tried removing all the blocks from

https   store solana com password  gt  Solana Store   gt    gt COMING SOON See you on the  sol jet bro Yes  It s also upgraded my fiancé I m impressed  I ve seen normies take a modest  10   gain and run back to fiat without looking back at blockchain  Like   uhhhh Oh it s definitely revolution my finance Maybe some   majority of players understand ETH is driving the layer 1 EVM play aka defi  oracles etc The real ones know   and if you re hodling a layer 1 EVM coin bc  price went from  400 to  5k  then sure   but dig deeper and you ll see If you don t think ETH isn t revolutionizing finance with  defi  then I think you re in the wrong place sir Haha  Me paper hands  Never You re early  We re barely finished phase 2 of alt season  After ETH rallies  value will flow into  eth killers  like BNB  Sol  Dot  Ada  basically layer 1 EVM ecosystems  sol is my pick out of all of the above   sol has more of my portfolio allocations than BNB  Dot and Ada Dont get cold feet paper hands    SOL is comfy sir FACTS com What are your qualifications Yea your fooling your self if you think people are buying eth cos it revolutionises jack  They buying it cos its gone from  400    3000 Congratz on the profit youve made  Its tempting to ride doge up  up and up but taking profit and turning yr back on it takes a lot of nerve I stepped away from doge about three weeks back and it feels so relaxed So welcome to Solana and enjoy the ride That might be why you re in it  but not everyone  Making money is a byproduct of a technology that revolutionizes an industry  but it s not the primary objective of projects like Solana  It s only the primary objective of shitcoins and scams Greed doesn t make the world turn  innovation does  Greed destroys most good things  Just look at what the Bitcoin and DOGE community has become for an example of that You wouldn t have a bull cycle if it weren t for all of the innovators that slaved away for 3 years during the bear winter  so be grateful for our tech leaders I mean  That s all any of this is  To make money  Greed makes the world turn gt I don t get why this coin isn t hyped  its got such a good premise Because smoothbrain retail investors are buying coins like DOGE because the crypto community isn t doing their job and educating people about what this space is actually about  That s what happens when everything turns to greed   The first bull market had people diversifying into solid technology because the premise of crypto was explained to them  Now the only thing explained to them is  buy coin  get rich So one week of Sol not going up 70  means that it is abandoned by public  These things ebb and flow  I m sure the tune is different in a week or two Try  https   app aave com   https   app aave com Hey  and if you ever miss doge  Solana has its own version too sure Yeah I just wanted something I could link a hw wallet to I did but their support is way backed up  I hope I hear back from them asap I did this  still nothing  This solved your issue This totally inaccurate  you re just having a   personal opinion   trying to make it as facts about Solana  amp  then you re building a whole new theory how that is bad for Solana or Solana holders   community     Then you just assume the persons who ll dislike your OP  AKA your   personal opinion    are  just SOL maximalist  What s left then to make you change your mind  you came up already with your misleading   personal opinion    amp  speculation  about the SEC  trying to make it FACTS Scam Lol what recent price tank you talking about  The doge correction or solanas tank from  38 to 32 and has barley gone up since  I was hoping solana would start increasing by now  But its finally going up by looks of it  All dogecoin is doing is correcting  being dumped by whales  If it finds the floor at 0 27  0 31  it ll go back up  Doge was 100  sort term  but has given altcoins a path to move and show they aren t shackled by btc any more  But Solana investment is like eth is not the coin is the way it can be built on Also id be more worried about the winter  If this coin doesn t get some more hype around it  it s gonna drop further into the pile of coins  I don t get why this coin isn t hyped  its got such a good premise The one link with a www  Is a scam  Tried to get you to go to a desktop to use meta mask    Watch out sorry this happened

took me a few hours to get 1 cope reward  After that I clicked harvest  clicked confirm  and then it went to my wallet  When I click liquidity  it wants min 50 cope  I don t get it I relate to this  When i was a senior in high school it was around 300 Smart move man  Everyone with a brain knows that DOGE was just a short term gamble play  Most people will lose money in this market  as evidenced by the recent price tank   but coins like SOL will continue upward for years to come how much did you have in cope usdc  and how long before you got 1 cope to harvest agreed  and amount of validators

about cryptos with uses other than just transactions  Welcome  HODLGlad doge is attracting new investors to learn about the industry It s under development  please do not use it  Even the  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  wormhole bridge sometimes gives some glitches  amp  you ll have to contact Serum Support in discord  Sollet section  to fix some non received transactions Better contact Serum In    Telegram    https   t me ProjectSerum  or    Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6  about this  i prefer you contact their Discord  According to their Support in Telegram  they gave me this link    you should read it      https   link medium com rbwsljzN6fb  https   link medium com rbwsljzN6fb I really need help So I got my reward in the cope usdc LP  So I harvested my 1 Cope and I want to stake it back into the LP but when I go to add it under liquidity  it says my COPE amount must be greater than 50  Am I doing this wrong   I had a buddy that does this all the time with step and other coins and he s never had a minimum required  I definitely have over 50 in the pool  Thanks Absolutely  https   matic network dapps gt 	For instance MATIC  polygon  is increasing adoption like crazyHow so  Does polygon actually do anything yet  I can t find any way this chain currently does anything  Are their dapps and wallets  or is this eth compatible like BSC and xDai Show me a polygon dapp  and how to move eth onto it  There are already Solana dapps and a way to move eth onto it There is native USDT on Solana  It is just called USDT  Not sure how to use SPL tokens with solfare  I use solflare to stake and sollet to do defi and move SPL tokens around When do you think your index finger will overtake your legs  Sol doesn t need to overtake anything  it s part of the ecosystem and while there is some overlap  Solana is for use cases that require blazing fast confirmations  You can even consider Solana as an L2 of Ethereum with L1 use cases  just as Polygon However  the difference with Polygon is that Solana is a small friend of Ethereum  not a pariah and midwives that will at some point try to become the mom Pretty much  And also the mirror case  You have two coins you believe in so much  that if ANY goes lower  you d want to buy more of that  Well  in a sense  the liquidity pool just ensures that happens  There always needs to be a relation between the pool s fees and the likelihood of a big mismatch  For example  assume one of the coins gets hacked and goes to  0  What happens to value of such pool  Tends to  0 as well don t think soEth is our brother  we growth together  Eth will lead us Very insightful  So basically adding liquidity only if you believe in both coins and are willing to accept the performance of the runner up  Each pair is just like a portfolio and it s kept being rebalanced If it s an incentivized pool  swapping the third coin and adding more liquidity will make early adopters earn more but it shrinks quickly when more people jump in and emission rate is cut meh defi is financial hot potato I really don t think that will be an issue  There s plenty of L2s to solve the gas issues  For instance MATIC  polygon  is increasing adoption like crazy and will solve this  ETH will always be king and that s still ok for SOL I sent you message  can you please answer LOL I believe  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  uses wormhole    Its been functional for at least a month  And beautiful  Interoperability is here  scaling solutions for dApps are happening right before our eyes Shoot  i just deposited my SOL into Exodus ‍ ️ ‍ ️  Where is the best place to stake How do you contend with people that push back vs centralization  Think the community needs to do a better job at marketing where Solana fits into the ecosystem in terms of having a good balance between achieving speeds with having a decent amount of validators let people do what they want tbh Serum and Raydium 1  Buy USDC at FTX us  usdc on binance is erc20 version  you need spl version  Ftx us has both and will send the correct versuon based on wallet adress  If you already have funds in binance us you could send usdc from binance us to ftx us then follow the rest of these steps not having to wait for your fiat to clear   2  set up sollet io wallet  send usdc to it  3  go to raydium io click the trading tab  this is a ui for the Serum dex  and buy RAY or SRM with USDC Tldr  You can trade on the serum dex in the US and buy any spl token you want  Part of the beauty of defi is being able to trade on a dex in countries where centralized exchanges are nerfed They will coexist  At this point we d need a miracle to overtake  Solana just isnt getting the publicity the other coins are Yeah  I don t think it will be taking over eth defi any time soon if at all  ETH is huge man lol no one can predict something like this So I just unstaked from exodus thinking 10 45  was legit then found Ray SOL LP is at 70   Insane Some disclaimers  You re paid in RAY not SOL  You have to have an equal part RAY SOL to participate  So you will need to convert some of your SOL to RAY  The 70  is real because it tells you what you ve farmed in real time and after 1 day it was trending 70  The nice thing is on Raydium io the swap cost is just insanely low  So experimenting doesn t feel like you re flushing money down the drain You need to add liquidity with a minimum of 50 cope to usdc  you can t just keep compounding by adding 1 cope  What you can do is unstake say 50 cope  add this to make 51 and then redeposit to get lp tokens I normally just let it wait until I have 100 cope  sell 50 for usdc then add liquidity Learn better English then try again Sound advice  I usually spend hours and hours frustratingly trying to figure things out myself then pay a pro i guess it was meant for the give away   i doubted then on a second thought i gave it a trail   lucky me Android app version Tired of web browser extensions  I want to move my balance to Ledger Nano like my ADA which is tied through the Yoroi mobile app lol nice try  Wallet doesn t have two T s shhhhhh lol I have tried unstaking Solana and waiting 4 days but nothing has happened  When i hit unstake it loads then nothing appears to happen As a rule of thumb  if divergence increases 5x  ultra rare    IL is 20    And even then you can wait with unstaking until assets converge  Mean reversion is a thing   In this extrem case you would still be up due to farming after a short timeTldr don t overthink this Thank you I don t think so  but you can transfer from sollet to Exodus easily using SOL  and go SOL   gt  RAY on Raydium Good Move  I Just sold at  0 55  Honestly  I m not really mad  Bought in at  0 28 and I just had to see it play out  Lost out on about 20   but it s good I learned my lesson on meme coins with an overall gain  Sol is looking nice right now  stability wise  Can t wait for the future IL does not matter if APR rewards exceed it  from LP and fusion pool   That should be easily the case here after a few daysAlso IL is mostly theoretical as buy ans hold is rarely a true alternative  nobody would have bought Step just to hold it  everybody wanted to get the nice APR That s actually a good thing for someone trying to get inLess upfront capital required  more upside potential  and pressure on yields eased as people who joined early exiting  Plus now auto compounding in solfarmWould nevertheless not do that unless I plan to hodl for a few weeks These are the daily candles ah a little late in the game then It gives Binance more centralised assets over the entire crypto market  The point of being able to stake is to spread the staked currency across all validators  not personally I mean as a general consensus 76 by end of may Note  Impermanent Loss is a concern with LPs that may not make it possible to unstake  your assets as they were before Hey  basically liquidity pools are a kind of dual crypto stakes  Which means that you associate for example some of your RAY with your SOL for both equivalent values to create a liquidity called RAY SOL LP  Then you can stake it get reward For RAY SOL LP you only get RAY reward  it is called a farming pool  Fusion pools are also working with liquidity assets but you can get reward in other crypto than RAY  Like a dual reward in RAY and the other asset or only the other one  I can only recommend it because it is very simple to use and all liquidity stakes offer a really interesting APR  I also want to mention that you can unstake and remove the liquidity at any time to get your assets as they were before if you need them It has only been two months using raydium io and I already made a lot of interest with the liquidity stakes and the new AcceleRaytor On the solana app of the ledger itself enable blind signing to be able to add other solana tokens Actually you can t use trustwallet because it s built on solana Yeah I posted the refferal link but I m really interested in the solana ecosystem that s why i stumbled upon this    If you don t want to use it just delete the part with the code in thz url and refresh the page What is the new news on coinmarketcap then about solana   Im curious Do you know if any of the Raydium compatible wallets support XRP  It s the only currency that is both readily available to me and can also be swapped within Raydium Phantom wallet is coming  it s gonna be the shizznizz    https   www reddit com r solana comments mn5sj5 phantom _wallet _for _solana _using _ledger _nano _x _on   https   www reddit com r solana comments

time the Bears tried to push it below 41 5 for a cheap buy  chart by the minute   Eye opener  you ll see the kind of selling pressure needed for that What I think it s many serious whales got in late

com price Solana SOL  https   www livecoinwatch com price Solana SOL Checking all data ranges I see very different graphs Like cjwill2017 said  almost every single altcoin in the top   200 have had a massive and similar growth since December January  and look pretty much identical to the graphs you posted what about the step usdc fusion pool in terms of loss stability  i been eyein that one So you d go for ray serum pair but not ray sol as we expect sol to grow faster  I mean it s what I expect lolFor now I staked some ray  proceeding step by step as I don t want to make mistakes That s peanuts compared to the  9 trillion USD printed last year  A crypto doesn t have to have a limited supply to be deflationary  it just has to be less inflationary than fiat Imma look into that I have some sol on my wallet just laying there  Might as well do something with them and I do agree with you  SOL will eventually become one of the top 5 Any defi with farming on Sol Yes  you will suffer impermanent loss  However if you do it for pools where both tokens are likely to move up and down in price relatively equally like Ray and Serum  then you wont suffer much impermanent loss Sorry I m new to defi  if I use my solana for this purpose can I suffer the effect of impermanent loss  I know that if I just stake something  for example Ray tokens  I won t suffer it Use sollet wallet  Best solana wallet for defi imo I currently farm on solana because fees are negligible and its probs the future of the whole industry imo  I get liquidity tokens on raydium and then i put them into the solfarm website to earn rewards farm If you re referring to how to start using Raydium   Go to Raydium  look at the wallets you can connect  Move your SOL to one of those wallets  connect it to Raydium and do whatever you please with it  I don t know anything about liquidity pools though so someone else will have to fill you in on that Someone please tell what to do  I have SOL sitting in Exodus wallet ready Not the same as 3 from Scream 3 You can also try going to  Balances  and press  Settle all funds   I had the same problem and this worked Tested 41 range like four times  Bar a market dip from bad news I think it s a break above 50 https   test step finance   dashboard  https   test step finance   dashboard  here you can connect your sollet wallet  apeboard finance  https   apeboard finance  here you can use your solana address to see your total assets Y use  step finance  https   step finance  or  apeboard finance  https   apeboard finance   so you can see your cope  cope price and total value Take it easy  I think the same and I think I started when it was  4  But you know  I had to buy more at higher prices  We should congratulate taking good decissions with the info available  based in sensible reasoning  Perfect decisions aren t possible Maybe you will feel lucky in 6 months of joining so early to Solana Anyway  I m invested in a diversified portfolio but Solana is one of my safest bets  I m not in a hurry to see it increasing because I m confident the market will recognize that this is one of the best project out there I have been reading into that and I think I get it  in which platform are you currently farming on  How do you calculate your ROI to get  50 a day  Any information is appreciated it works only with the sollet wallet guys  they dont support the phantom or else It s time for people to actually save what s left  or else it going to be another carnage for here onwardss Save money save crypto Doge is nothing but a scam
2021-05-10,44.34209297,45.87750147,39.55884763,Thank you for the clarification  I am also planning to hodl for long term Do you mind sharing some other coins that you hold  Personally  I have BTC  ETH  ADA  DOT and BNB  I plan to add SOL next https   solanium io  code 1UAu9dAT  https   solanium io  code 1UAu9dAT   referral  https   solanium io   https   solanium io I havent verified this  But maybe now you camhttps   twitter com solflare _wallet status 1391733830441111556 s 20 For some reason  solstarter itself feels like a scam to me  I can t really tell you what s wrong with it  but somehow it doesn t feel right I have a set of ideas at this point not really started with any of them  but my favorite at the moment is  a forum like system where every question has a budget which gets distributed among the answers depending on how many upvotes the answers have with exponential decay  similar to arweave  A similar system to stackexchange where there can be multiple sub forums for different subjects How do you get a beta key yeah its awesome from the looks and functions Its like a metamask for solana Honestly for a beta its way better currently then sollet and it will be the main wallet for everyone once the beta ends Its easy and fast i swapped everything to phantom once i got the beta key how to solve this If I were your landlord I d be all over that Yeah man  Sol is so so fast  so when it doesn t show up you re like WTF  That said  thinking about the possibilities for this  mind blowing Honestly  they both seem kinda sketchy  Solstarters token distribution looks pretty piss poor for being  community first   and you ll need to have a pretty nice bag  5000 staked SOS  of it just to be eligible for the IDO s at even the lowest level  We don t have any details yet of their own IDO  but how much do you think 5000 SOS is gonna cost when that drops  Hint    prob not enough for most people to get in  And that s setting aside the chatter on Twitter about a couple of the guys there being involved in a few pump and dumps    Solanium I dunno  but the whole retweet for more tickets stuff is pretty bush league  I signed up for the airdrop so we ll see I guess  but I m keeping both of these at arms length What are you building Just an ordinary person who got obsessed with blockchains and want to invest because I see the potential to change the world lol Really is it that good Exactly  thats why solana is so amazing  Its not sharded  Its all layer 1 currently 20  sol  80  eth btc From what I ve read about SOL it seems to be leading the way as far at tech consent along with Cordano and Possibly ETh 2 0 which there are still questions over the tech issues but as far as concepts go I think SOL is a good bet That sounds cool  good luck I m split almost equally between BTC ETH SOL  Maybe should have diversified a bit more but SOL seemed like the most promising alt coin to me  Thought it made sense to have a sizeable chunk of that rather than having to keep track of a ton of smaller investments I don t care about   for SOL it s so early  I mean I won t reduce   more like increasing it slowly Yes Mobile support in Solana in general is shit  also Wallets etc    I d expect that to change Buy the different coins and use them on the different platforms  Raydium  FTX  Serum  SolFarm etc I think i m mostly using Raydium atm As often as possible  given that trx fees are so low   But that s a pain in the ass  So ideally automated  via solfarm io Yeah I m already using that one too  Need to check it out on my pc  Noticed a bug on mobile that m wasn t displaying any numbers for the apr apy You can automate this via solfarm io  they automatically sell the STEP rewards and re stake to the LP   This maximises return and makes life easyLP tokens can be  partially  withdrawn at any time  e g  when you need liquidity etc The LP currently yields 5 95  in fees and 73 96  in the farm  both APR  via solfarm with hourly compounding   The divergence ray sol has been pretty stable  and there is no reason to believe this would change  other than daily fluctuations  in the short timeWhether farming or holding the coins is better depends both on the above mechanics as well as expectations about the future  In the absence of changed expectations  I see no reason to believe that these will change Anyways  DYOR  don t trust strangers on the internet  or narratives in general   only trust your own calculation in Excel Roughly 50   I m planning to build some stuff on solana so it will get handy Sorry  how can I edit that Did you post at the correct section This is partly a reason why I don t install any other social media apps on my phone or PC except for facebook messenger which I use to communicate with my family members I don t even use whatsapp  So my only source of information is through youtube  reddit or google Thanks for the clarification https   solanium io  code H4MLk5ui  it is also a link for the pre sale and airdrop I got that same message too I double checked and noted  gg and  org being different and blocked the  gg messager The rule I stick by is  if ANYONE EVER messages me first about something  I don t respond or click on links Simple as that The easiest way to stay updated about what s happening with SOL etc is to sign up to their newsletter and follow official accounts on Twitter Discord is honestly a horrible place to get information because you can just get messaged by anyone of out nowhere Really sorry for your loss man  not fun at all I have a RAY SOL LP Token staked How often should i check it  How much are the fees  how often should my ray token been harvest Binance is showing higher yield for locking 3 months It s mostly the inpermanent everyone discusses  But that s why I think RAY SOL is likely the best pool because they re both part of the same eco system  Likely one isn t having a breakout without the other  I can see the other pairs having this issue with maybe the RAY SRM pair being a good combo as well Thanks for the summary  Very useful for newbies like me Can you provide a disclaimer in your article  Are you part of Solana or just an ordinary person How did you spread it across the ecosystem Theyll never get fees as low as Solanas  ETH will still be very successful but thats the truth I m done for my DCA into cryptos this month Next month I m targeting to buy some into SOL After a few days  If youre talking about the ray sol pool  thats a tiny percentage yield  in the timeframe of days  which will be eclipsed by any notable divergence in price between the two coins  Dont mislead people Hmm  Solfarm connection isn t working for me right now  Too bad  Hopefully the way Raydium does it will become more standard because it s a better user experience than using Metamask with other coins For me it 2 3  depend on the price swingBTC ETH and BNB made up more than 70  or my holding DOT and ADA are around 5  each Where can I buy these Nice Nice  thanks Link for solantium please Solstarter seems big  but for now i think Solanium is a killer Launchpad for Solana for the time being Unless you have couple

they exist together At the moment i am accumulating SOL every chance i get  The rest of my portfolio is just hold Sold half my tokens in VET to buy SOL  spread some of it out in the Solana ecosystem 3  Most of mine is in Eth   BTC as standard I loaded up big on ADA in March  amp  April The more tech like MATIC is adopted  makes using Eth faster   cheaper   the harder it ll be for SOL to make big gains moving forward  Not saying it won t  just the competition is heating up That being said  if SOL gets more dev adoption compared to Eth  then holy crap we ll all have wished every bag we had was with SOL from day one  Odds of that happening  I have no idea That s why we have diversified portfolios you should try to get into the phantom Beta if you think sollet is the best one What is that the samo I read about 100k million which received solana for one of the project Currently staking on Exodus Where are you staking Currently yeah you just have to connect with your ledger directly  and for dapps that don t support a direct ledger connection you re kinda screwed until Phantom gets out of beta  I know Sollet technically supports ledger but it doesn t really work  at least for me it s stuck on a different address than my actual one every time I try to import my ledger Dayum the doge gonna chase you  Just kidding good move  Let us take Solana to 500  dollars to the moon by 2022 I am gonna try too Solana will revolutionise the Enterprises  I love this project and want to stick  long time  Also staking at 10 50 apy You ve just summed up why sharded solutions won t actually solve anything I was ready to buy  75 000 worth in August 2020  but a friend talked me out of it   I was literally searching around trying to find an exchange where I could buy the SOL   I was that close   But my friend told me that I would probably affect the price of SOL with such a large order  looking back on it  I don t think that would have been true  and also that I should wait until the unlock in January because the price would probably tank Well I listened to him  and then kind of forgot about SOL as other life priorities came to the forefront   January came and went I never even noticed that SOL had started going up instead of down Would have been nice to have 30 000 SOL right now   Oh well  my fault for not sticking to my convictions So the RAY SOL LP is currently 74 42  APR    https   raydium io farms   https   raydium io farms   What are the risks to this  This is considered a better return than staking SOL even though rewards are paid in Radium edit  there appears to be some risk in this as outlined in other comments below This is awesome   Now I just need to convince my landlord to accept rent in SOL and I ll be set Is there a reason why Solana hasn t made its way onto coinbase  I feel like availability might be holding it back Also the exclamation point was a typo lmao I look crazy now with my first comment Sweet I am glad I could help  I am stoked it was the solution  I know when that kind of stuff happens to me even if it s just a little money I am anxious as heck about it until it s resolved Man   yes  That is what happened  It didn t show up in the  open order  tab   but the way it showed up on my screen  I didn t think to scroll to the bottom   and boom  there it was  Thanks again The ground sentiments are relatively good for most top cryptocurrency counters  however the confidence on SOL is obviously lacking and slacking   ‍ ️ ‍ ️ Based still Is it in open order Shill your games please  Would love to investigate the gaming sector Ok  I was able to swap it by increasing the slippage to  10 This is not good  Isn t Sol Ray is main tokens of the system  Why it requires such a big slippage  I m disappointed https   youtu be I5fPunY1lH8Heres a vid that shows the apps in the ecosystem Yeah  same issue  Raydium and solfarm allow me to directly connect my ledger so thats what i do  I also have a sollet but its not connected to my ledger Cant go wrong with staking in solflare  But if you wanna have fun and get ur feet wet in defi with some of your sol  its crazy what you can do with 0 fees Thanks I will try discord Can you see the rewards from your stake in solana beach  If not how can you see the rewards  Thanks This is helpful  thanks Thanks so much for the reply  I guess I m going to wait until I accumulate 100 so I don t miss out on the next airdrop Have you tried opening your wallet into other browsers  Are you still seeing the same glitch into other browsers gt if I have a SOL balance  then log out and delete the seed password  will the balance remain after creating a new seed password No need to worry it s just like any regular Log Out procedure  your wallet   seed phrase   password   assets in your wallet remain intact  amp  won t change gt I m even considering learning rust but I m feeling a little full on projects not involved in crypto  Also I can t get it installed on my laptop because of some dependency that I did install but not recognized  If anyone knows rust and can help me get it installed let me know if you can help You may try to join  Solana Discord  https   discord com invite pquxPsq  to ask about that  it s the best place for such question  or you can always wait for someone using Rust to help you in ReddIt This is def alot to take in  Im new to Cryto and Defi  Just wanna know where i can stake and hodl my SOL Long term for best retrurns    ‍ ️ Crypto is regulated  Ask New Yorkers why they have such a hard time buying SOL You ve got a new fan I m aware of the use case you are talking about but that mostly to leverage  What I mean by loaning was for real world use cases like typical banks give loans to buy property  car  or business expansion All of it  You sound like a stupid person gotcha I was thinkng Vechain but that is another protocol I m in to Hedera but any way you look at the market Solana metrics are very impressive Me too   I just bought in 2weeks ago   it just went down some and stopped doing anything   Could be worse   Patience i guess  looks like a good coin and all   Besides Sol  I am only in top 3 coins most is in Eth and has been great  BNB pretty good    Bitcoin has been Just like Sol     I ve only ever traded stocks online  when online trading first came out   Looking forward to adding much more Sol and being here for the long seconded  NFA Thank you u ansi09  I hope people find a way to mint NFTs on Solana cheaper in the future Yeah i didn t have much invested into the step usdc fusion  but i just kept reinvesting my rewards and with the price going down i spent less on usdc to make the LP Why is Solana granting funds to developers who wish to remain anonymous yet putting them on podcasts Its really fine still  Imagine now being Etherium in its early days and 6 years later its 4k already  I think is still early overall  I bought SOL when it was 16  it went up to 20 and I thought it was too expensive  went up to 27 and I thought it still too expensive for me  I waited for it to get back to 20  but it did not  It went up to 38  and I just bought more  I think you can just buy some SOL with money that you are comfortable with there are fake telegram groups out there too  and fake web sites selling tokens eg solstarter investment Raydium io I m predicting  350 by the end of this bull run Awesome  gl in the hackathon Hey thanks for reaching out but I figured out that we need to have a role first  Thanks a ton Yes there is  It should have brought you to it after you signed up  I can try to help you in a bit  busy right now Solana could absolutely reach top 5 10 this year imo  100 is gonna be a blip on the radar hopefully Absolutely cant speak for him but my rationale for  at least  100 is this    Solana only went live in March 2020 and is already more useful than both Cardano for smart contract capabilities  and Polkadot for cross chain support    there s    90B in market cap btwn those 2   Sol SZN hackathon has over 7000 registrations  there are projects coming out left and right  RPC API servers being improved  Ethereum updates taking too long to come to market  easy to use wallets coming out  All these things point to Solana being at least a top 10 project  currently 17 on coingecko   amp  x200B Solana currently sitting at    12B market cap      43 per SOL  If SOL 2xs from here we re at 24B mc which would only be 65  of polkadot s  current  market cap  Even tho we now have stablecoins on multiple blockchains  somehow  XRP as a cross border payments solution still has  65 6B in market cap   again  we have stablecoins and visa is now settling USDC  XRP is unnecessary in my humble smooth brained opinion  amp  x200B I think Solana will be up there with Ethereum and BNB sometime in the next 2 years    nobody knows the future but i ve made my bet based on these reasons and then more  who doesn t get irresponsibly bullish listening to SBF or u aeyakovenko talk about the future of crypto This is great  I wonder how long it will take to be the new norm So we ve signed up but it just takes me to the discord but I m not allowed to post anything  Is there a portal or something for all participants So you recommend solfarm over raydium  I don t quite understand why there are two such similar services platforms on the same ecosystem 76 during may   100 not too long after I would love to know the rationale behind this Forget sol for around 4 months and comeback check  ️ ️ ️ you have a happy day for price I ll be following this project I ll be shocked if it s not I m comfortable buying it at any price where it s not in the top ten  My valuation puts it at whatever  market cap  the number 10 crypto is as a minimum Just after reading your question I saw this on the Solana Discord which might be of interest to you   BlueMagician   Yesterday at 1 42 PMHi  I m the founder of Solarians   https   solarians click   https   solarians click     We might be interested in partnering up with you to help you release and sell your NFTs  You can DM me or come to our Discord if that sounds cool      https   discord com channels 428295358100013066

 Be wary  Lots of scumbags like u Dazzling Client 2844 abound about 20 Are those tracks stored on Audis servers or the solana blockchain Mine some fiat Congratz dude welcome to the best of the best Try these simple solutions   1     Make sure to leave some SOL for Fees  do not use the Max Swap amount  you neeed some SOL for Gas Fess for the swap to complete   2     Minimize the Swap order size  amp  try again   3     Un Link Your Sollet wallet from Raydium  Refresh  F5  the we page  Link your Sollet Sallet again  amp  try one more time   4     Try other browser s like   cjwill2017  https   www reddit com user cjwill2017    yes it does help  sometime it s just a UI problem   bug mostly with GoogleChrome That would be great but I think the real gains will come when all these Solana projects in the ecosystem come to fruition  Like Burnt Finance nft minting and auction  Still may be half year until that takes off idk   ‍ ️ Marked This was the good update from SolFlare that the community was waiting for  Finally they made it  I hope that problem of     i can t see my staking reward in SolFlare     is now resolved Yeah  SOL will have its time  Give it a month and it will be above 100  mark my words Yep Try using a different browser computer  Worked for me  Also  I recommend using phantom wallet Tried discord channel  got key  Its amazing I used for the first time this service  just to check it  a small amount   I added only KIN to a pool  and then it disappeared from my pool list  it appears that my KINs got lost also  is this possible    Sorry if this is a newbie question Wish I had money to buy more SOL  what a chance Lava cash is actually really dope It seems like a network issue   Raydium issue  I m sure this will pass soon but has been 10 minutes now Having this same issue now I m at   50  SOL  The rest of my holdings are pretty diverse  ETH is my next biggest investment at around 25  I m ok with my portfolio being heavy on Solana because I think it has more upside than other coins I invest in  I m still at the stage where I m trying to gradually get as much money SOL as possible  but it nevertheless feels risky once I start to get around 60   despite my confidence in Solana Just withdraw your RAY to your Ray address in FTX  why using SOL address in FTX for your RAY withdrawals from SolFlare ooo yay  more projects  Meanwhile the token has tanked loosing me money and crap coins with 0 use have made me  100 s   Whats going on One golden rule to put in mind in crypto  iof you got a DM to participate in an ICO  IEO  IDO  be 100000  sure it s a scam That was your 900 USD worth lesson  but at least you know how to deal with crypto scams from now on  Sorry for your loss  amp  i hope you recover that sum in the nearest opportunity 100 Gate io  https   Gate io  is having serious problems with deposits   withdrawals  People are complaining about that in their official telegram group  The Admins said that the  Gate io  https   Gate io  team is working on that DirectDepositDion https   audius co thebachelordion Ask Solana and Phantom How can we know to trust phantom with our keys  Would really prefer an official wallet 65    then 30  ETH and the rest is in Ada  Dot and some remnant BTCI am basically putting all my eggs in it   million or nothing I think this was also done for ETH2 right Just be aware that any and every coin can have their coin supply increased through software changes   Even bitcoin   If the big miners all decided to take a new version of bitcoin software that raised the block reward to 100 BTC  then it would happen  and the  cap  on number of BTC would grow   And in fact  I would not be surprised at all if it  does  happen when we get close to the end of block rewards in bitcoin   Do you think all those companies with millions and millions of dollars invested in equipment will just decide to stop taking rewards   Nope   They ll protect their investment by ganging together to get a software change pushed through that increases BTC block rewards again Solana is no different to any other crypto   It s based on software  software can change   There are community mechanisms to prevent arbitrary changes  like people fleeing the coin if devs pull the rug out too fast too hard   but any change is always possible if the alternative is the coin dying   If more inflation will keep the coin alive  then there will be more inflation  for every coin What s settling funds I deposited STX without problem yesterday Thanks   I l try the chat too I did    it took 6 days but it showed up I did wait 1 hour for their chat to bring the matter to their attention though  and they assured me they have submitted an internal ticket   After they did that it still took 4 days I think they are just backlogged Very interesting  I have an idea for a way to mint  staking tokens  that are tied to real SOL tokens that are actually staked so that people can stake and participate in defi at the same time and uphold the security of the network  This has been already done in the cosmos ecosystem and someone should bring it to solana  Would live if you stole my idea and made it a reality haha  Wish i knew how to code Comment didn t age well Sorry for you loss follow on twitter and once they tweet you hope that its a new wave of beta Access   Or try on their discord channel after paying much fees mainly to transfer USDT out of binance  I now just buy Sol  transfer it to sollet for a penny  then from there i can do anything on raydium for the sol ecosystem  or transfer the sol to  gate io  https   gate io  and buy anything sol eth ecosystem without paying Ethereum gas fees From a business perspective it makes sense to have your hand in each area   DEX   Serum  CEX   FTX  Retail focused CEX   BlockfolioIf you haven t read this yet  SBF s  Ultimate Vision for Serum  https   projectserum medium com an ultimate vision for serum 473a16e77201  explains a lot I respond with profanity Don t use Gate io but have you settled funds
2021-05-11,42.87227262,45.15120191,39.76296959,You make some very valid points  but if enough ppl believe it then it s real enough Any reasonably secure blockchain is a store of wealth  And when people can t use a token  prices drop  people panic sell and then the wealth is out of the store  Value comes from utility  The analogy with gold doesn t work  because gold is a physical material and will always be more permanent than a digital token Then  with quantum computers  PoW based blockchains will soon become extremely centralized and infeasible  so I don t believe in Bitcoin or anything PoW at all https   ftx com  a 5LESSFEES  https   ftx com  a 5LESSFEES   gets you 5  off your FTX trading fees Stop looking for  reasons  behind price action  It s supply and demand  Always  People will say uninformed things like  whales are suppressing the price   they re also wrong  Supply and demand Big facts     salute Hi  would be grateful for you help  I am trying to send sol from  sollet io  https   sollet io  to binance  but there doensn t appear to be an option to send  Please help TCAAB It doesn t matter where it is  in a famous scalability trilemma  they choose to sacrifice decentralization  so they are really not competition  At least for the people that understand the value of decentralization The price in their own IDO is  0 15 payable in SOL  https   solstarter medium com solstarter whitelisting guide 776656c4365e   but only 2000 people will be lucky enough to participate  So the price for staking 5000 SOL would be  750 in the IDO  but might run into the thousands on the open market Haha   We are kindred spirits Damn  it s no wonder this is the only comment here   You said it all That is Sooo funny    laughed until tears sprung  Probably because my trading started a year ago and you have just verbalize what I internally believe about my own trades  just never said it out loud  Thanks for saying it out loud for me   Lol Yep  this is the one  thank you It was already talked about  amp  explained in  Solana Medium Blog  https   medium com solana labs mainnet beta stall postmortem ba0c6064e3 You re in the SolFam now  go ahead  amp  make yourself home  respect each other  amp  let the daily discussion begins  Good luck rewards are immediate and you get paid every time there s a trade against the pool  if you stake those LP tokens you ll get paid every second  check out step finance or apeboard finance for a nice way to visualize your portfolio Also glad to be here  Thank you for shedding light on the positivity posted on this subreddit See you on the  sol jet YES is  solstarter vip  https   solstarter vip   to buy sos token is a scam website I got into a card game on the Ethereum blockchain called Gods Unchained  Each card is an ERC 20 NFT to allow for trading  Basically when gas fees blew out the NFT forging mechanism had to be disabled and trading ground down to a crawl  They ve had to develop their own layer 2 solution which is still a work in progress I ve been investing in stocks for more than a decade  Bought and sold good stocks over the years  I can pick the right stocks but i learned that I m better off to just hodl on to the stocks instead of selling along the way  So in the last 2 years  I tend to just hodl on to the stocks and will just ride through the market cycle So I m going to apply the same approach with cryptos  am new to the scene   The problem with cryptos is they are more volatile  So you must be able to stomach the high volatility of your cryptos portfolio  Good stocks and cryptos will recover in a bear market eventually I expect more Shiba Inu price pump  I meant  SAMO The dip is because of the too much growth of ETH and in the past of the medium cryptocurrencies  Apart from that it will start again it was only an agustment  Take out some of your eth and put it in ada  LINK  and btc i m holding down the fort until i need a downpayment on a mortgage Hey guys  im staked in a RAY SOL Pool on Raydium  How do i see the rewards  Is it fluid as far as returns  Or is it like EPOCHs every 5 days like Cardano ADA Timing the market is incredibly difficult  Most people that do it professionally are wrong more often than right If you think SOL is a good long term investment  maybe consider HODLing  and if there is a dip  use it as a buying opportunity Bitcoin drops  everything drops   That s how it goes up 3 dollars since i sold  goddamit   sigh    oh well  anyone looking to short  i offer my magic buying power You can do that ofc  but bear in mind that such approach would require that you sacrifice certain aspects of your life in order to be vigilant and stare at the screen all the time  I ve tried it  and became aware that I had been neglecting my kid  hadn t time to have a chat with my friends or to see a movie  Moreover  I didn t feel good generally  Then 1  I decided that social aspects of my life are more valuable to me than potential     Financial gain from being focused on the market 80  of the day 2  i realized that actually I earn more from HODLing than from trading  even if the psychological satisfaction level is not the same as when I realize a short term gain from daytrading Your money  your call  In any event  I wish you best of luck He said do 50 75  as hodl through and use 25  to sell at the end  My strategy as well Eos have kind of high troughput  not even close to Solana  they are promising around 3k tps   but they compromise on running only on 21 nodes  so definetly their tech stack is not bulid to be decentrelized  It is pumping today as there is news that DEX will be built on it and it has backers with big bucks  saying that I think it will be typical pump and dump story I would say it is about supply and demand  considering what are the farming fusion yields on USDC STEP payed in STEP it is really not suppresing that price is going down I totally resonate with your apprach In some ways I think they d be better off just implementing EIP 1559  having it become deflationary  and viewed as a store of wealth like Bitcoin I feel the same way  I m just trynna figure out if I should try to sell at the top then buy once the crypto market crashes or if I should just HODL the whole way through Agreed Ethereum will stick around  and eventually Layer 2s and sharding will arrive  But there is no free lunch  and there will be non negligible trade offs to all of these new systems  Vitalik described designed Eth 2 0 as rebuilding a rocket while it is in flight  I think he s right  but I also think that is a foolish thing to do  Build your rocket on the ground As a former bank employee I ve divided my portfolio in two categories 1  trading book   cca  25  of the porttolio  daytrades  speculative investments based on momentum  without conviction2  anchor book   75    SOL  based on conviction  75  thereof is staked on Exodus at 10 5  nominal yield  25  is available as liquidity reserve or collateral In any event  I can t see why would anyone who earns wages for living sell SOL at this price level  or any price level for that matter  SOL is probably the only coin that has defi characteristics  strong backing  good brand  I can not emphasize this enough  and potential to become wide spread currency system    unlike the ghastly ERC  currencies  with prohibitive fees   My 2 cents  Eurocents I plan on holding for like 3 years at the very least  What would u recommend I do if that s my plan 1k Bruh are you serious   300 is programmed It doesn t have to  The problem just sorta solves itself lol SOL is up 50  in the past month  It had never traded above  40 until April 25th which was 16 days ago  In those 16 days its been trading between  41  amp  49 so it doesn t work It blows my mind how people talk about ETH 2 0 like it s A  right around the corner  and B  a certainty to do what it s intended  It s been talked about for as long as ETH 1 0 has been around FFS  and a year or two in crypto is an eternity I don t think Ethereum is going away any time soon  but to me they are the Yahoo to Solanas Google  and they just don t know it yet People just say fuck it that s too much and then the transaction never needs to go through in the first place https   solstarter medium com solstarter whitelisting guide 776656c4365e I didn t read it all  but this is the  Postmortem Blog Article  https   medium com solana labs mainnet beta stall postmortem ba0c6064e3 I have it open right now and I don t see the option to trade SOL Try 300  the other day   that drove me to switch from holding eth I just wonder how most of these apps are expected to work if any on chain transaction will cost you or your users 15 Ethereum has the first mover advantage It may have been the first but I doubt it will be the last Thanks for the clarification  it actually sounds pretty clear  For instance is like comparing manual cake to auto cake  How much do we believe in the ray token though  I mean I d love to farm extra solana  not sure about ray  I honestly don t know much about it yet  I should dedicate some time to research I think so too Just my opinion but once I saw filecoin go crazy  I def think solana can go to over  100   I don t have access to charts but just thinking how quickly it jumped from  11 to  40  I m hoping the next run up will have it touch  120    I m no expert and these are just my opinion  not financial advice Would you please change the Title to      Solana withdrawals      suspended     on Binance     so it doesn t looks so misleading  Thank you Is SOL now fully supported by Binance ie The real SOL and not the erc 20 version Thank you for your honest review man  the community is growing steadily  amp  helping each other  Welcome to the amazing SolFam Golden How do we get more hype around sol I m quite new  Have not read about EOS yet Can anyone provide a summary of problem or attractiveness with EOS It depends what you have  Just check it out  Or serum maybe  They re both fairly self explanatory I will say that I lived my best  life when I receive gold award  too   had a  51 karmas       and agree with ur statement While there is a lot of truth to what you say  they do have future plans  I m not sure what it s worth  but it does feel like people are shitting on it just to shit on it right now I don t understand how people invest in an alt coin and are surprised by volatility  There is a really high chance that you will see an 80   drop in price at some point  expect it It s the same Raydium farm  just that solfarm automates the compounding part in the background  Theoretically you an do it by yourself  but at an hourly or so pace that s a huge painThink of it this way    1  You provide Liquidity on Raydium  for which you get an LP token  Solfarm takes your LP token and puts it into the Raydium farm  2  Every hour  the proceeds are harvested by solfarm on Raydium  In the case of the RAY SOL token  the harvest is in RAY  so solfarm sells half the RAY for SOL at market prices   3  The proceeds  SOL and RAY in the correct ratio  are then automatically added back to the pool  so your LP token amount increasesYou can try this with a small size  maybe that makes the logic easier to understand  It s pretty standard in the DeFi space  I guess that s why these pages include only very little background information on the process on their page  Certainly not optimal for new users What do you consider the dip nowadays Hahahah that s the spirit  Get that money from SHIB and move that back over to SOL while it s still a little lower than ATH  Sounds like a win win for you my man No I m aware it s a fantastic project it s just pissing me off that coins with 0 sodding value are skyrocketing for no reason other than blind faith  That shib coin is going to crash and burn  But hopefully not before it makes me 100  from a 2  investment  I m already up  62 Yeah man  shit happens  You re up what like 20  on an asset over a month period of time  Take a step back and realize how fucking amazing that is  Also remember this project was literally  2 maybe 4 months ago so it will need to cool off at least for a little I would like to know the same lol Sol has outperformed btc and eth too just zoom out dont sell at at a loss it s going up It s the bitcoin whales having fun longing and shorting each other and unfortunetly all the market follows   there is a strong bearish sentiment in the us economy and therefor in the us stock market Follow  InspoCrypto on twitter he s the boss https   discord gg vWAzcAHU  https   discord gg vWAzcAHU Can you please share the discord channel Who cares the price  farm with raydium dudes 50 50  It either happens or it doesn t Definitely an awesome community regardless of the platform and stake I hope so  Other ways I m fucked wait  reading reddit doesn t count as research A solid borrow lending protocol is still needed  its being worked on by multiple teams but no one has done it right yet  The block explorer needs to be improved to better communicate to the user exactly what is happening when a tx is confirmed   A SOLID MOBILE WALLET  I d like to see a copy of Coinbase Wallet App but for Solana  a lot of crypto people don t like trust mobile  but it s 2021  get over it Early investors taking profits I m sure there is a condensed way to do it but that s how I went about it Kracken  Bought USDT    gt  Swapped in  ftx us  https   ftx us     gt  Staked on Exodus Wallet Well  I think we should all hope it s works because it s the only way to scale up future needs Wall Street sold off heavily on fed rate hike concerns because of the inflation data  this spilled over into crypto Do your own research  Hold hold hold  Buy the dip Yes i understand now  thank you It s better to conserve your energy  or money  and allocate them to one  or a few sources   In war  it means to not spread your army too thin as it creates weak points In investing  it relates as it is unwise to have a plethora of small investments as opposed to a few strong investments with more significant positions It is also very true in sports gambling   It s almost impossible to make a lot of profit by betting on dozens of games   It is smarter to make bets on 1 2 games that you feel best about and put most of your funds towards them Much better  in my opinion  I m certainly no expert   to have a huge position on SOL  as opposed to breaking that up into several smaller investments   Hope that clears it up You can buy and withdraw Solana on there Joke    It is just normal fluctuatation due to Quantum Physics I think this dip is an indicator that the project failed Aaaah man    How about I sell it all  then it surely must go up  Or is yr  luck  stronger than mine Just bought SOL yesterday  so I too apologize Same     aaaand i just sold at a loss to give everyone else a break The price is dropping because I just bought SOL   And it will continue to drop until I sell it  at which point it will skyrocket This is why im on this sub  All the people answering in a nice way and trying to explain  Thanks ftx us Oh but of course Bitcoin had its usual sell off by whales which triggered a lot of longs getting liquidated but this time the impact to SOL came from when ETH dropped which had way more longs get liquidated this time so that impacted all the alts more this time regardless of BTC dominance To understand what s going on with your crypto bring up an exchange listing starting from BTC   ETH and so on and you ll see the trend of  what happened to  your crypto My thoughts on Matic are the same  I m invested in Harmony and Solana  both for the same reason  because I see Ethereum as a sinking ship  Matic has the benefit of leveraging Ethereum s existing security compatibility  but that also means that you have to go through Ethereum first to get to Matic  It s like a bridge with Ethereum fees that you can t opt out of Low mempool for Bitcoin along with the hype of Doge dying and introduction of a lot of shitcoins  This correction could last anywhere between 7 10 days BTC is causing the dip  for all of cryptos    I don t think it s over people need to be careful now Thanks for taking the time to answer Thanks  Nice reply and it makes sense  I myself invested in ETH a couple of days ago as well people post and waste others time for what could be a simple search on google or coinmarketcap same problem How does buying through other crypto work on raydium  Do I need to bridge into a wrapped token first Slightly off topic  I got my Serum wallet set up  but does anyone know where I can find stats on median Solana transaction fees    They seem cheap but this info should be easily findable Probably ETH BTC secured SOL bought on margin  When ETH BTC dropped  they got liquidated It s a dashboard  Doesn t need millions of dollars  Way overvalued Is Nina the same thing as Audius People has been bullish on ethereum these days and they are using high leverages in trading so the whales take advantage of that and shake the market so their long positions get liquidated and that creates a buying opportunity and suchSource  my own research and amount of liquidation per trading website  a website for that You got your wish   ETH down now too Binance withdrawal is down again for SOL and SRM  that s not helping either It works quite well  but perhaps the feeling is currently it s a bit overvalued  But then again  whole market is in corrective fase Solanium is new as far as I know  Don t think its a scam  But its not financial advice Shiba and doge Lol fucking eos Bitcoin is down  almost every other altcoins is down Obviously there is that   and if I thought that that was the only explanation  I would not have posted this  I was wondering if there might have been something going on like a stop in trading or a set back in the organisation etc ️Plus the 10  staking APY  Exodus is great  and SOL is probably the best thing about it  Only caution is that SOL exchange is occasionally unavailable  haven t seen any limitations on sending or receiving though   and it will likely improve as the platform grows FTX is the best in my opinion  Nice staking option for SOL there also its called regular market behavior  you simply cant go up only How does this question get asked Do you have crypto already  If so You could try raydium If not  you might have to get on binance us I guess it is  like the eggs in a basket metaphor      ‍ ️Don t know what he wanted to say i just looked up the rule Wait   is that like eggs in a basket Buy it on Ftx its Solana s most important market place which grow with it What I like about SOL  apart from intrinsic value  is that it is very stable and moves in     10 pct range over the course of last couple of weeks Last night  CE time  during the flash crash I had some positions that left me scrambling  got liquidated in ETH leverage trade  lost 6k    But not SOL  of course it has fallen somewhat  but I didn t even bother to check it So  this is a value play  Like it was for Warren Buffet when he bought Coca Cola stock Same for international  I dont understand what is going on with Binance Binance does that  For Cardano to  Especially just before tge next epoch Wait why would you pay eth for sol Yea Yeah thank you just figured that out haha If you can get on FTX I recommend that highly  Way better experience imo Withdraw is suspended not deposit  My bad Hell yeah Always be careful with your crypto  When its go it cant come back make sure every link you join in is from someone you can trust You re right  withdraw is suspended once again   Trading works ofc  At times I get the feeling that Binance is limiting outflow to Solana this way Can take 20  hours like last time Nice Available and you can trade it now I just buy sol on binance so may be something wrong with you What do you mean  I have 0 2 eth and loads of coins on binance  only issue I had waa trying to move 3USDT  They can t transfer 0 00004 of an eth it cost more than its worth  The minimum transfer and withdrawal is 0 00016 eth depending on protocol you use  I d say binance is pretty fair all things considered  I agree they want to force BNB coin up  But at end of the day  Most exchanges use binance chain  No exchange is just going to let you trade without making some money I d say all exchanges suck to some degreee  I brought my solana on gate io anyway Could be worse  Could appear on robinhood Definitely hits 100  this year and more than that KuCoin Yes but both suck  An exchange that let you enter only max 2 decimal places for crypto trade price is playing games to artificially inflate their BNB coin by forcing many small amounts to stay locked by millions of their users Solana is trading on binance right now   what do you mean suspended Serum discord  This was like a week ago or so  I d go ask about it if you re interested Binance US  amp  Binance are different Solana is a better coin but it has so little publicity  No ones talking about intrinsic value  Hell no one wants the next bit coin they want the next doge coin Solana has so much intrinsic value  But it just drops and dips  Which is a shame Tbh  It could hit 100  at end of the year but unless something changes it won t happen FTX for me  They re have no withdrawal fee and simple interface Bitfinex and FTX are the good options for now It s a sharded network   I think that s a dead end   These networks are going to have a bad showing if and when they ever actually get off the ground That s my opinion  I know others may think differently Mostly this is your speculation  and I think that you re mostly incorrect It s been proven to handle 50k TPS at the current hardware and network level There is no point to comparing a single centralized server to a distributed trustless system  not sure why you even brought that up  it s an impossible comparison for  every  block chain and thus completely irrelevant A  multi servers database  with synchronization protocol  and scripting facilities  is  exactly  the best thing for the backbone of a defi nework  which is why you are wrong when you say  it will never be a good candidate for a real decentralized  trustless open network   Were it more open  figures would go down drastically  is baseless speculation and evidence is that you are wrong  as this has already been tested Solana does require high end hardware   It does not have  few nodes   it has more than 500  and this is for a network that actually does stuff  not a network that  theoretically might do stuff someday ugh  off again today  amp  every time I want to actually withdraw It s off again today  Has it been turned off the whole time It looked like withdrawal was available today but i just went on  amp  it s off again for SOL at least  So annoying Bought mine weeks ago  amp  still can t withdrawl SOL Yes  Been stacking sol on binance since sol was   14 Withdrawal is turned off for Binance US tho Law 23 Conserve your energies by focusing them all into a single source of power Your post has been

the Solana Beach builders here Thank you for your kind words  they are encouraging for us to push hard and make the app even better Hi mate  I use an exchange called Swyftx  Super easy to use and definitely has SOL plus their whole ecosystem   https   trade swyftx com au register  ref brentboydskinner  https   trade swyftx com au register  ref brentboydskinner   lt  This will give you 20  off fees   a kickback for me if you want to be a legend yes  for a while now I brought in at 31  a coin think ath was 35 a coin  Its just getting annoying a coin that should be doing better because it had an actual use is going to get fliped by a coin that s a rip off of doge and has 0 use  Like at all  It has no exchange linked to it  It s utterly useless In your legitimate quest for figures  don t forget to compare apples to apples    TPS as    moving SOL from one address to an other    second     TPS as    contract call      second    TPS as    exchanged messages between nodes    second  Also  in a layer one non shared network  the throughput of the network is inversely proportional with the number of nodes  A single good old SQL server will easily outperform  on any metric and by orders of magnitude  any distributed network  Solana included   So now you know why Solana has very few nodes and requires high end hardware  Were it more open  figures would go down drastically  Also  this is why it will never be a good candidate for a real decentralized  trustless open network  Is is rather a multi servers database  with synchronization protocol  and scripting facilities  Good tech though  definitely has a place in the ecosystem Exodus  using the swap feature dollar for dollar and the eth it charge for the swap is only 3 6  max    I m talking swapping 1000  worth of link into 1000  worth of sol and seeing a swap fee of 5   It s glorious I think it s also the whole crypto market in general  All of them are down  That being said  hopefully 40 holds Currently 60 It s STILL not fixed  Binance US is the fucking worst  Started migrating everything I have off that shady exchange  and not only are the withdrawal fees for certain assets ridiculous  but there are a bunch  SOL  EOS  NANO  BNB  that have been suspended in the last week or two  And of course their customer service is maybe the slowest and most unhelpful that I ve ever had to deal with Ftx us Updates and queries are splitted on every smart contract platform with exactly same effects  Queries are instant   free  updates are async   costly  This includes ETH SOL etc I don t think its stored on arweave  that would be incredibly costly try Kucoin for US Pretty serious bug if this is true  You got any links or sources to where you read that Thanks  Will try to find this book  it sounds great 353 53    let s be precise really confident in this project It s because you set Sollet to auto approve transactions  They changed something the other day that screwed it up  Something about auto settling transactions  and if you look at all of those transactions you re seeing  that s what they are  I don t quite understand why they changed it or if it will be  fixed   but basically  don t set your wallet to auto approve and you ll be fine May be it s an airdrop token you asked for  no information about it in Solana Explorer Make sure not to delete it  sometime it s just the LP token of one of your Staked token s in one of those Dexes Head and Shoulders on the 6hr chart  wish I took some profits but I m long for sol regardless  so eh whatever   I hope I m wrong cus I m holding strong lol What Operating System   Browser are you using with your Nano X That is a known issue with  windows OS  amp  ledgers Try these that might help you fix your problem 1   Turn off ledger live on your desktop or anything else using ledger and make sure you are in the solana app 2   Try using Firefox Yea I d move the funds asap  I d recommend a hardware wallet but they can be pricey  either way make a new wallet  write the seed down on paper only to make sure no one has access to the seed  and move your fund there  Better safe than sorry  good luck I just uploaded my seedphrase into another wallet  which allowed me in but saw no balances  but after I did this I went back and tried to log in to sollet io which then worked Thank you every one SOL   SRM  gt  XRP s on demand liquidity It might take a few years but the market will realize it eventually  Cheers Polkadot is going to change everything  but I think it will enhance projects like ETH and SOL spl USDC USDT  gt  XRP Excellent post  I m a heavy XRP supporter but after jumping into SOL a few months back  I would agree that there s almost no point to XRP now  Solana can do everything XRP can and more  The only difference is XRP s connections with backend financial software solutions  Both coins are my main holdings but if XRP were to moon way past ATH I d 100  dump profits into Solana Solana is game changing and  100 SOL is still undervalued IMO You could always swap it on step finance as well Exodus Just move your assets from that wallet  amp  transfer them to a new one  just to be cautious Then do not use that wallet you re talking about ever again Look up Law  23 of the 48 laws of power   Happy investing gt Plus for some reason I don t have permission to send messages in the discord channelGo to     role

when Sol goes to the moon  10 6   APY is huge for the number of SOls I have  Nice Retirement Plan Lmao sorry you bought the local top dude  Just chill and it ll go up soon Yes I m having issues just logging into my account and I can t submit a question to their  support  team  This is feeling very scammy all of a sudden Yeah but some upgrade would have to happen  which should happen soon  would have to occur  Im talking about max right now as we speak  Which is still 10 15 times faster than any other decentralized layer 1 i think there s a theoretical limit somewhere from 400 1m tps ive definitely seen anatoly say something about that FTX the best exchange for Solana The team is top ten  SBF  Anatoly   the technology is awesome  proof of history   proof of stake  like 65 000 tps   4 sec latency   they have smart contracts  and they have dev hacker builder types playing with their shit  I ll bet on something like that belonging in the top ten any time We hope it doesn t take long  But either way  we re happy to accept Solana coins as payment for services rendered  store them  and let them appreciate  We re also considering spinning up our own validator FTX  Avoid Binance for all there shady withdrawal practices recently Stay away from gate io Fees are literally  00005 cents every swap  Its amazing  And it takes  4 seconds per transaction That is the current tps  Not the max tps right now because we dont have enough transactions going on chain to reach max tps which has been tested around 50k with current tech Thanks for sharing  at least you ll save others I got mine off FTX  no complaints If you read the guidelines channel it will tell you how to get access to post  It s there the stop people from posting without reading the rules I think Binance US is probably the most popular place to buy where do I buy solanabeach io  https   solanabeach io  has current tps info Yes raydium io or solfarm io wich auto compound daily for you  Even when you sleep lol They will after they have bought enough for themselves     same for coinbase  etc

Don t buy a giant green candle guys  Go look for new airdrops on Solona  https   www solanium io  code oTbDMjZN Another promising  SOL project w  an airdrop  https   www solanium io  code oTbDMjZN It was market wide  Keep your eye on BTC eth and the trad  market What would be far more useful would be a Compound button for rewards I also noticed this in my wallet and have no idea what it is Is Dfinity a competitor to Solana 2  By wallet I mean wallet addresses  The answer is  it is extremely easy to create a new wallet address  1  Solana  or any blockchain for that matter  doesn t limit the number of addresses that you can generate  This takes up very little resources on the Solana blockchain Therefore the primary function for rent is not to prevent network spam  I suggest you take a  look at  6 on the Bitcoin Whitepaper by Satoshi   https   bitcoin org bitcoin pdf  https   bitcoin org bitcoin pdf  I m not dissing you  we are clearly both believers in Solana   but let s give out the correct information to the best of our abilities I would like to hear more about these  as well get a vpn Happy cakeday Hi personally I m waiting for the DCA feature Layer 2 is already here and delivering  Have you tried Loopring The tech is fully mature  competitors are starting to roll it out now That s very informative  thank you  Must do my homework  I haven t calculated   current  apy  but will test your claim at an independent account  and will get back to you with results In any event  8 percent or 11 percent is totally irrelevant  This exceeds everything that the system  which I dislike  can offer me  Moreover  the system  i e  bank deposits  bonds  etc  does not offer me any rewards or yield  Meanwhile  cost of living has spiked enormously  commodity prices have spiked  e g  I wanted to change the roof on my house  but tin prices have doubled year over year      everything has risen except the wage that I earn SOL brings solace I m only in VeChain and SOL  VeChain has one and I think would be cool to see one here as well DAlthough these looks like pretty big projects for a hackathon I just find the amount of information being asked on Solstarter on top of BNB and ETH  reservation  to be a red flag I understand you want to avoid duplication and spam  but that level of information is a security issue I m surprised they didn t straight up ask for my all my passwords If it is a scam  I wonder what the reason behind it is because it s a completely free airdrop being advertised  ‍ ️ Pretty sure your view on Samoyed has changed on the view of what s happened in recent times gt What are the differences between DEXes on the platform  Differences are only in the UI UX  gt Which ones do you recommend for transactions Raydium is the King of them all  gt  Which unique advantages does each one offer  Nothing to be noticed except for Ocra Swap  fast and smooth  the rest they are almost the same  gt Which would you recommend for liquidity mining Raydium for sure gt  What issues did you encounter with each Mainly some UI UX bug  sometimes solved with just using another browser  sometime with disconnecting and connecting the wallet again  refresh     if that doesn t solve the problem  their support groups are there to help along with this great solana sub reddit  gt  I m aware that Serum is backed by Alameda   Research  I also see Raydium recommended a lot Raydium is good with or without SBF  i can tell you that  the solana sub reddit will confirm what i just said about it  gt I noticed that there is SolStarter and Solanium  which I understand are   IDO launchpads  What s the difference between themYes  they are both LaunchPad for IDOs  Solanium tokenomics is 100M  their sale price per token is good  i can see lots of multipliers there  and will still be a low market cap token  The team vesting for their tokens isn t so great  couple months  SolStarter is good  but i think it s overrated  their tokenomics is bad  1 Billion  no thank you for me   The team vesting for their tokens is great  1  year   gt which do you recommend  etc   What are requirements for participating in IDOs  I   heard it s a lottery system of sort I personally chose Solanium  but if lucky i lll get into Solstarrter too For Solanium it s a lottery ticket kind of thing  if lucky you may be chosen  the good thing is that you ll get what you paid for  Limited numbers of buyers  so no FCFS kind of things For Solstarter nothing release about that yet  just the whitelisting process for now  gt How does Solana s staking  or its equivalent  work  Do I need a special wallet  I see it s not compatible with MetaMask Just use Sollet or SolFlare  your keys   your money   Solana isn t compatible with Metamask since Solana isn t some sort of fork from Ehthereum  so    There is Phantom  which is still in Beta  that will be the  1 wallet for Solana  like Metamask or even better Of course there is lots of other Solana compatible wallets  web wallet  apps      that will take time to keep mentioning them  gt I see that Solana has a bridge to Ethereum but stumbled upon a couple   threads saying it s buggy  Still it is buggy  sometimes it goes so smooth to be honest  Even when shit happens  the support is always there for help  personal experience  Sollet   Metamsak bridge is run by Serum  so if shit happens there  contact Serum support  gt Should I stay away from it or is it a good way to buy wrapped ETH tokens Yeah  it s not that great  since ETH gas Fees are like hell right now  gt What s Solana s NFT space like Still developing  no that great yet  gt What other projects do you recommend I dive deeper into on Solana s ecosystem  The ecosystem is emerging so fast  so better follow Solana social media accounts to catch the new ones   Solana _Dailyann  https   t me solana_dailyann  is a good place for that in my humble opinion  gt Which projects are underrated  Which are overhyped  Any   promising IDOs coming up Even shitcoins in Solana are good now lol because of the fast   cheap transactions  Aside from jokes  FTF  Raydium  Serum  the coming Jet Protocol This is why I love Reddit  thank you all for your help  If anyone is experienced in Rust and wants to work on a cool project let me know  We have interested investors and trying to get a team together before Saturday He publishes 13  apy on his site  I understand that Exodus keeps a share in the pie   and I can vouch that I get credited every epoch in line with the stated apy of close to 10 5 percent https   everstake one solana It s definitely overvalue in current state  and they build very slow Like SolFarm already have a working product for you to auto compound  and Apeboard support step usdc pool in day 0  but Step dashboard roll out step usdc their own pool   support in the next day So I doesn t hold much faith in Step team and I think they will lose the competition in building It s legit  Really looking forward to seeing their platform launched  So far  looking like the best Solana focused launchpad imo Solstarter is flawed imo  The whitepaper makes it sound excellent  saying  everyone gets a fair opportunity   but they ve confirmed that they will be excluding some countries from even using the platform at all It s not a fully decentralized or permissionless  Because of that  I think Solanium will be the better platform Graph is okay and looks promising  one of the problem that blockchain can solve is data ownerships so Graph could be very valuable in the future But for now I don t think it s mature enough to gain much returns for investors in near term  compare with other category like Defi  Smart contract  exchange coin Go to the raydium website and connect your wallet  There you can buy raydium and exchange other solana coins How can I start buying and or using raydium  My wallet doesn t mention it I do hold SOL Thanks for the clarification  Can you share anything on the roadmap for tps improvements  Transactions take about 1 2s now which is blazing fast compared to any other chain ive tried  When do you personally think we ll see  instant  transaction confimations Ik  So glad I sold it at  5 20 Graph is decent  I have some  it powers CMC and CoinGecko charts for each coin so it s not going away anytime soon and will only grow with the ecosystem  With that said  I m not sure if the coin is just a share or has a legitimate use case Great idea MATIC has already solved this with an l2 solution  It is doing more transactions than eth is daily now and growing rapidly  It s a brilliant solution to Ethereum issues  Many dapps are adopting it  Opensea  one of biggest nft exchanges  is working on their integration atm This I personally think any exchange token is a great investment  They re making crazy profits why wouldn t you buy their native token  GateToken is on a huge tear right now aswell   Sorry to mention outside the Solana ecosystem but I m a big bag holder of all of these  GT token is a must buy and FTT and SRM and RAY gt the only reason bitcoin is superior to anything physical is its limited supplyThat and you can take it with you anywhere  unlike physical assets like precious metals  Of course that s also true of all other crypto ADA is and will be great Check out VET  amp  MATIC  all there are game changers in their own right Are they true Ethereum apps though  AFAIK Audius already runs part of its logic on Solana  even though officially their project is still on Ethereum  Sushiswap already integrated with Harmony  so even though it s still on Ethereum  I think they re exploring other options  I wouldn t be surprised if many of these projects have plan B  even if it s still Ethereum based like Matic  Or perhaps  they figure that by the time they deploy their app  Ethereum 2 will already be here  Also  maybe they re just using Ethereum to raise funds for the project since that s where most liquidity is currently  Many projects that eventually launched as standalone chains initially sold their tokens on Ethereum when all they had was a whitepaper I m having a helluva time figuring that out  Doesn t help that their site is down Of   75   Hm It sounds like maybe you aren t staked and are just holding an LP token  Computing the value of the LP token can be done using the LP details but that s too complicated for me to type on mobile  Rewards should be obvious   shown and computed at every block   lt 1s   That would be on the farms tab next to the RAY SOL pool  If that s showing your have 0 staked  and the LP tab is showing your token   then you aren t staking the LP token  Hit the  stake  button on the farms tab for that pair  then hit max Bitcoin works by decentralizing computing power  Miners get to vote on the next block by performing work  A quantum computer would be so much faster at guessing the correct hash that they will have a lot of voting power which could quickly lead to a 51  attack by a single party  This is not possible wih PoS systems If you have sol  you can go to raydium io and use their swap feature to trade your sol for ftt or srm  These are not actual ftt or srm  they are wrapped by spl token but they keep price I agree  but I don t think he has that luxury  his rocket is already in flight and he can t land it  This is why I roll my eyes every time I hear the argument that Ethereum is better than everything else because it has the most devs working on it  What people don t realize is that 90  of those devs are fixing problems yesterday s devs created  It s an aging system SOL is one of the best fundamentally amazing cryptos out there   but watching it daily will not work if you re looking for short term gains   moons and shibs will extract much of the glory short term  but SOL will provide utility and gain momentum as legit crypto investors get it   hold it for 5 years and you can retire  if you want   but that is for losers Try sonar watchYou do need to  harvest  the RAY rewards tho  Did you stake the RAY SOL LP  That s the best thing about this  Other posters mentioned you get paid every time there is a trade in the pool which is technically correct but the RAY won t show up in your wallet until you harvest Seeing as the TGE is live  I posted an update and tutorial on how to sign up  https   youtu be CYGcGmTy _v0 Because I use it every day and it s a pleasure to use  Their UI is the best in the Serum ecosystem  their LP farming is extremely generous and they have an IDO platform that is very popular  Pretty much if you ve used it  then you will understand  No need to really overthink it that s very likely Hi too but I d love to hear ur rational for why specifically u r bullish on it  I m Dad I am too but I d love to hear ur rational for why specifically u r bullish on it So I YouTube  how to buy SRM  amp  FTT wrapped on Raydium Happy cake day bro How does Exodus staking work   Is it something above and beyond normal staking Exodus wallet stakes with Everstake  and Everstake makes 8 21  APY  not 10 5 There is  but I have noticed some very knowledgeable people on this thread and was wondering some thoughts on it outside of there forum  I know they will pump it on their forum so was looking for some unbiased info i have sol  link  ada  polk  one  eth  idk anything about the graph sorry couldn t find anyone by the name  bluemagician  on the solarian discord  if i mis understood that message my apologies  i couldn t tell if you meant yourself or someone else   thank you for the message though i sent them an email on their website to try and get in contact Sorry  how do I do that   You re ossum mang  Thnks Buy them wrapped on raydium Anatoly Yakovenko is like Jesus and the holy spirit put together  Ha Please tell me how to buy FTT  amp  SRM from Minnesota  USA there s prolly a subreddit for the graph I have to agree Godamn right I am More nodes  Awesome I believe everyone looking at token first looks at coinmarketcap page  Asking questions like that literally show the person does not bother to do a basic search about the token and its listings etc The community here is super helpful but everyone needs to respect others time and ask questions which they cant find answers for otherwise  I am being practical  not negative  I try to help others where I can and I ask questions for which I cant find answers easily  So I respect mine and others time 1000  correct  Just hodl and it will pay off Good idea Thanks The way it s been hovering in the low 40 s  hoping that s the new floor  Not much action for a couple of weeks but with all the good news I have been reading  wouldn t be surprised to see a big push in the coming weeks  Trevor Lawrence used his signing bonus 22 mill plus  on 3 cryptos  Bit  Eth  and Solana  To me that says a lot  The guys advising him definitely believe in Solana  He is a big name in sports and it can only help  Might see him wear a Solana patch during the season on his jersey  Even if the price drops below 40 and into the 30 s  but the dip  I will be loading up appreciate u my g Just joined up and hoping that the Solana community is helpful and generous with their time  and thus foster a positive community for the future  which is beneficial to all holders Answering  Yes  is quick  easy  helpful and positive  and helps the entire community   The original post is equally helpful  in that it assists newbies  flicking through the Solana posts for the first time  to see important information  such as the Binance listing You are only wasting your time if you choose to be negative It s called impermanent loss  I d look it up if I were u cuz they will do a much better job explaining then I would be able to Love the daily discussions on other threads  I think it would help expand the community Yes  that s correct  it s something that has been faced  amp  fixed  it shouldn t happen again Where does the risk come in Staking is where u earn interest on your coin  Yield farming is a bit hard to explain tho it s kinda where u split ur coin between two coins then u earn pretty high interest on it but it s more risky than just staking Newbie here  what does yielding farming staking entail It s kinda like pancake swap  U can exchange solana coins on there or u can yield farm and stake Appreciate it Way overvalued lol  It was due for a correction Thanks for the valuable input  Based on this article one can assume the issue won t exist in the final Mainnet version  Please correct me if I am wrong This was my exact method as well  Except now staking raydium What happened to step tho do you have facts about quantum computers and pow or is it a theory  and if it is fact why cant a decentralized network utilize quantum computers as well Furthermore  the only reason bitcoin is superior to anything physical is its limited supply  I cant think of anything else with truly limited supply and hence it can easily become the only true store of value  Yes we can create limited supply tokens all day long but bitcoin is bitcoin What does raydium do its either sol or warmhole makes it irrelevant  I send sol straight from  binance us  https   binance us  to sollet Is this sol starter actually affiliated with sol or is it just another scam   https   twitter com solstarterorg status 1392184802808410112 s 21 From their  website  https   docs solanium io the solanium platformed pools  The core function of the platform will be Solanium Pools  On Solanium Pools  anyone with a Solana wallet can create a pool to distribute a SPL token  We will provide an easy to use UI  where users can set up their pool with just a few clicks  The UI will also have the option to create the SPL token for the user  if the user did not deploy a SPL token yet The team will still manage the front end  and has the possibility to filter and feature certain pools  but anyone can create a pool on the Solana blockchain and create an own UI to interact with it  So basically a crypto kickstarter built on solana  Very exciting for the future of fundraising  Legit imo LOL  that s not a dip  That s call accumulation Wait   they hold  1 5B worth of BTC but now won t take it for payment because it s not environmentally friendly          Wow he s all over the place FUCKKKKKKKKKK Binance    ️ ️ ️ I did  I m actually still waiting for verification approval after like 60 days on Binance  FTX was great and has been a pretty easy to use exchange  I use my card for instant deposits and it s pretty flawless so far The supply of Bitcoin can always become unlimited through software changes   If enough miners band together behind such a change  which they will have significant incentive to do when block rewards become zero   miners have a lot of investment and an income stream to protect  after all  it would happen It would be a lot easier to significantly expand the bitcoin supply than it would be to expand the gold supply Then what relationship does MATIC have to Ethereum at all if the entire point of it is to eliminate all obvious ties to Ethereum I read a little  I guess the main benefit is that they support the same tooling for creating dapps as ethereum 2 second block times on matic  not sure about expected TPS   Do you know what their expected max TPS is Solana is the best token though Who knows what will happen   But I think that Solana is an excellent choice for any company who wants to accept cryptocurrency payments   Transactions are fast  secure  and transaction fees are low   I can only hope that Elon is doing better research this time around   It was obvious to everyone who knows anything that choosing Bitcoin was incongruous with their environmental concerns I don t think Solana is the only coin in this category but it is a good thing to hear for alt coins The MATIC chain can be abstracted away and then the user doesn t even notice  For example megacryptopolis is an eth city builder game that they side chained to matic  Now there are no fees at all and the devs just eat the costs because they are almost non existent  This is an example of an Ethereum dapp game that died and then was resurrected with MATIC support Great news Elon just announced that TSLA would stop accepting BTC payments because of its energy consumption and that TSLA was  looking at other cryptocurrencies that use less than 1  of Bitcoins energy transaction   link

day before I could not Well technically he didn t ha I m excited too  Think people are discovering Solana regular one  and withdrawal suspended  can t even have them update me as to when they re open  that option was not available while in their help thing it says it is Someone posted in another discussion about how moving to matic was basically like moving to another chain anyway   You have to convert your eth over and pay the gas fees and deal with new wallets  etc   At which point  it s no easier or better than doing the same thing to switch to Solana Back to 47 5 now  Trading volumn doubled compared to yesterday  Back to No 15 Market cap rank  It s looking good Where can someone from the US buy it  It s crazy to me that it s joy listed on FTX us hahaEdit  I see people recommend wrapping it  Is there no other way You won t be going back once you make the move  FTX is great More volatile price on sol  It was as high as  48 50 but it crash back to 45 Thanks for the info

did you get it  I m new to Discord Hi Guleko  after using it for 2 months  what are your thoughts  I am debating between Moonlet and Solflare  Thanks in advance I don t quite understand  is solfarm connected to raydium  I mean does it operate through the raydium liquidity pools  or is it its own thing Good resolution Didn t FTX  which is a big Solana supporter  also list SHIB  You make a no sense a Ftt is native to eth  so with any solana dex you can only buy spl wrapped ftt  It tracks the price extremely well because of arbitrageEdit  read that wrong  Correct they are not available in the us  Either use a proxy on an exchange that doesn t do kyc or buy them wrapped Just use FTX USIt s really a wonderful exchange Never mind  looks like I can t because it isn t a fork of ethereum The documentation on docs Solana for the command line is how I went about it  It s not difficult  You need to install Solana   create a wallet  it creates a json file which is the key store it safely   and then there s a command to create a stake account the same way and have that previous wallet as authority and then you just need to instatiate the stake account with a vote address of a validator  Takes one to two epochs to start getting rewards  And then you can just check the public key of your stake account on Solana beach and it will show you your updated your balance after every epoch  I copied the key and put on my google drive account in case I lose my laptop so it s safe  All you need is the key json file and you will be able to deactivate and withdraw whenever where ever  Definitely check out the docs they explain everything very nicely and give you commands to plug in your info Crypto YouTube fucking sucks soooooooo bad omg I just got some  FROG Most  all   DEX es on Solana support a Serum style trading interface  There you should be able to see a full featured TradingView control of the pair you re interested in and place limit orders   In Raydium for example it s the first tab Trading or go to  https   dex raydium io   https   dex raydium io   and select the market from the drop down in top right It s my understanding that all trading or swapping in Solana is ultimately done using an order book model and the LP is shared between the trading interface and swapping interface  Also all LPs are shared and tradable from all DEX interfaces  if you add a custom market That would be great  not just because it opens the floodgates to a lot more buys but because it would make buying  sol a lot easier for many  I buy usdc on Coinbase transfer to ftx then convert and send off my sol  I hope it s true Currently  there is the solanium whitelisting  including an airdrop  that you can join  Here s a referral link  taking this opportunity to shill haha     https   solanium io  code l7JBSALE  https   solanium io  code l7JBSALE What were you thinking I haven t really heard any rumors  but that would be nice  I figure that Coinbase probably is reluctant to list Sol because Solana based DEXes could pose a threat to their business model exactly Glad it helps  no need to get freaked out as long as no transaction was made Ya I am  I m just wondering if anyone else is planning on holding this FROG coin or not Why would they list Solana when they are busy listing dog meme coins like SHIB Tbh not true  When there is an anticipation of release  prices pump up till release and then the price crashes day after listing  For unannounced releases  prices pump after being released  Watch this videohttps   youtu be GnI8 uxZPEg gt  As someone who has had their hot wallet emptied by a trojan virus in the past   That s my main reasoning behind insisting on a paper wallet basically  I don t want that unencrypted seed stored on my pc even temporarily because I would never trust a system connected to the internet with my keys  I thought about opening the file in a text editor and printing that directly and I could have done it if I had a printer at home  It seems the best option is to finally just get myself a ledger like you said around 55 minute mark Is there a comparison available to Ethereum 2 0  Curious on TPS  Obviously all still new  but that s the better comp IMO    Would also love to see more data on network size  How many daily active wallets  DAPPs  developers  etc  beyond just   validators  which in and of itself is less telling   Looking for resources and answers  not poking holes which part of it say that Are you holding COPE  I think thats why you got some There is a bridge in terms of tokens on etherium able to migrate over Sol is also a smart contract platform   Just much faster  ie the scalability solution    I m unsure if it is EVM compatible  but it can still do all the things evm can If SOL is getting a listing on Coinbase  I advise caution  Recent counters listed had been bashed soon after listing I guess time will tell Fake dude stop watching channels like this Off topic  anyone knows what s going on with Crypto com app   I can t log in since Monday and I ve not heard anything from   them  Pls any information will help  Thanks Some of it till August  some of it till it hits  200  some of till it hits  400  some of it till its the 2nd market cap  and some of it forever Great Solana report  however  there is one large error  At the end  they mentioned    In addition to this  on the current main net beta the TPS metric is  only  about 1000  as compared to the promise of 50 000    Solana can actually handle 50 000 transaction right now as we speak  The TPS metric on their website is how much transaction volume is actually being generated  There is room for 50 000 tps  but there just aren t enough transactions on the network to reach it yet In the Solana Ecosystem  I m bullish on Kin Great idea Deposit crypto btc eth use that to buy sol  I m pretty sure it s available on the US market now though so I tried this but still having problems  Did you deposited usd first  How did you do it if you don t mind explaining I ve got my fingers crossed that more exchanges will enable direct onboarding soon Absolutely a scam  The correct address is  solstarter org  https   solstarter org  amp  x200B You will never be asked to provide ETH to participate in the solana ecosystem Maybe  Just a little bit tho if u did  SOL is def a safe bet tho if u aren t a risk taker Yes  I m really curious when I see a small pump dump and not sure where to look for info   twitter sucks  I usually check the coins  subs by new or Daily discussion threads if there s one Probably need to moderate the  moon  comments though    Legit discussion on what s happening would be great There is  Serum  https   serum academy com en   and  SPL Tokens  https   spl solana com token   which allows you to create and  list your own token  https   serum academy com en add market    If that is what you mean https   www reddit com r kucoin comments n1gctr solana _any _timeline _on _when _solana _will _be _added   https   www reddit com r kucoin comments n1gctr solana_any_timeline_on_when_solana_will_be_added   amp  x200B I just go to this and upvote Yeah the slider on Serum Dex is an awesome feature that could be used Yea  I saw this and it seems promising but I m not a programmer either and I have no clue if how I can use this on windows  Seems like a Linux repo thingy Yes hi  If you compare two Solflare keystore files by opening them with notepad you will see about 4 values that are unique and need to be saved  You can then print these values and later restore a wallet by filling in these values But it is important that you test the restore process before chugging ahead  As someone who has had their hot wallet emptied by a trojan virus in the past i suggest you buy a ledger nano S or at the least use a dedicated computer with a genuine copy of windows and something like Malwarebytes So you can t just buy FTT or SRM   It s not on FTX or Binance US Why can t I withdraw my LP  It says  withdrawing  and shows the progress indicator on the withdraw button but nothing happens I am bullish and RAY is one of my largest holdings however the tokenimics are not great as the circulating supply is extremely low  I m hoping the high staking apy will help to offset this as well as the launch pad  I paid  15 for 1 5 media tokens that I sold for around  250 and immediately swapped for more RAY to stake  Next up mercurial finance Yes  that is a pretty good summary of the situation  And I understand why people still want to use Ethereum  But Ethereum is having problems for a reason  It was built to be the first decentralized computing platform  as a prototype  Back then  it didn t matter if it was fast or cheap  they just wanted to build it  Now people took that idea and started over with the problems of ethereum in mind  And I think Solana did the best job at addressing them  Rust is the perfect language for this use case  it is the most secure language while being among the most efficient  They improved the computation model  the consensus  the synchronization  it is almost like Ethereum 2 0 already there  At some point it is more efficient to rewrite a system rather than changing every aspect of it  I don t think Ethereum will ever be able to fix their inherent issues without basically rewriting the whole ecosystem I came here to this sub just now to go to a daily discussion  thoufht we had one  Definitely would be sauce    Let s break 50 Is it worth trading a small portion of my sol for some of these tokens  I don t plan on using any of them  only holding It would be a big improvement to the forum  and doesn t take much effort to set up the Automod Sounds like a scam  not clicking it Matic and Loopring are great examples of solid products  But there is still the onboarding gas fees that make a higher barrier to entry  I for one haven t tried either because I m not willing to pay  50 in gas to onboard Turning off ledger live worked  Thank you  I transferred the money back  I get freaked when things like that fail Yes I m talking about sol  That s great that it s up 215  but I m saying the publicity and marketing for this is non existent  To the point shib  an utterly usless coin increased by over 6000  purley by marketing and fliped sol  I m aware its consolidating  I ll be holding for next few years  But seeing rest of the coins that aren t as good and sol kept dropping right now is just sad  Although I think it s risen again  I ve not checked recently Are you sure you re talking about SOL   It s up 65  in the last 30 days and 215  in the last 60 days   we re in a bit of a consolidation faze right now that could last for a few more weeks as we trade in the  40  47 range before the net leg up to the  120  150 area  Patience is key here  This is when you accumulate as much SOL as possible   NFA While new dapps going live now might face steep competition in capturing market share  fees on Ethereum are so high because the chain has never seen this much activity  The fees are high because people are willing to pay them   Also  for a dapp developer considering where to deploy  it might not be as clear cut  Deploying to Ethereum has the benefits of strong developer tooling  great documentation  reusable code examples from other projects and a thriving developer community that can help with questions  It has by far the most liquidity and trading activity  The downside is you ll be priced out if your dapp aims to use micro transactions or targets the retail segment If you choose to deploy somewhere else you have to deal with a lot of uncertainty too  Which chain do you go for  Solana  Avalanche  BSC  Polkadot  Fantom  Cosmos  NEAR  Polygon  xDai Solana has some early traction and capital inflows  but so do many of the others  With Solana you d have to learn a completely new development framework and the tooling isn t yet as mature   potentially meaning longer time to develop  Perhaps you d want to retain the option to deploy to Ethereum if L2s deliver sooner rather than later  so it could make sense to go for  say  Avalanche  BSC or Polygon instead I love  and hold  Solana  but my point is that there s some risk in going outside of the Ethereum EVM ecosystem  It takes a long time to build a strong  self sustaining ecosystem of dapps  liquidity and users to the same extent as Ethereum  especially while competing with 5 6 other chains  It also takes time to launch proper scaling solutions for Ethereum  Which happens first  Polygon is already live  Optimism should go live next month  ZkSync in August Very interesting times ahead https   ftx us  a 1479348Super easy to purchase SOL here for any US resident  Once you have SOL tokens I d create a Sollet wallet and then you can swap for any other SPL  Solana ecosystem  tokens that you d like in raydium or serum Just used them the other day  It was great I m not going to read the btc wth ppr again  if you think I m being untruthful why don t you explain why instead of being vague about it Dude  so much this Ledger supports Raydium Ledger supports Raydium If you can get in to Solstarter  the price is very affordable

selling fiat products all day after all If you wanna hedge eth and 2 0 risks  go hold eos and solana very well said   where there s a will  there s a way   the way may be long  inefficient  and a waste of everyone s time Dfinity s only competitor is its own rebranded name  which it will forever struggle to overcome the negative effects of  Internet Computer  LOLTo be honest  I m not sure how similar the two are  ICP is closed source so not sure anyone is interested I totally agree   This has been brought up a ton of times and for some reason the mods won t do it  A daily discussion thread that is mod created and pinned and generated everyday is much needed  Most other crypto reddits have this and it generates a ton of discussion  There s also a way to do it with a bot  Please listen to the community mods Yeah I went through everything I could  It s legit  Timing of website being down was just bad just a general note for all the Solana scams if they want ETH its a scam Solana is the platform so if they want any other form of payment other then SOL or USDC or any other SPL token its probably a scam Thank you my friend  enjoy the ride https   solfarm io  https   solfarm io  helps with this  by doing the compounding for you This is just a superb answer with so much information I also feel like I learned plenty even though I ve been using Solana for a wee while now  I really appreciate the time you took to share your insight hi  i have the same problem SOS token will be airdropped to ones whitelisted  It s   15 per token  A million will be distributed according to the solstarter website The site says a million tokens will be distributed at IDO so does that mean an individual who s whitelisted gets 15 or 20 tokens only because if that s the case then it might not be worth it great idea  probably solana start it s rally btw No problem  I just don t want people to be misinformed and then become disappointed when they finally realize that the APY was not as advertised Full disclosure  I run a Solana validator   I am trying to fight against misinformation in the Solana ecosystem  including Everstake s claim of 13  APY  and solanabeach io s false claim of 11 79  APY  which at least is based on a real formula  the problem being that the formula is optimistic and shows the  maximum possible theoretically achievable APY   not the actual APY being achieved

traders in crypto get fucked  All these huge flash crashes recently are the result of leverage trading  It s bad for you  it s bad for me  and it s bad for the market You realize that if you don t sell this has literally no effect on you i have a lot of vechain Seems fine I made a Binance account just to buy SOL I got a comment about this on one of my  SOS videos  The things that bother me about this are the lack of a website as well as the team being anonymous  but I guess there s no harm in being part if the drop  You can even put an email you don t use and make a secondary twitter if you don t want them to have your data ftx doesn t work in NY btw  I just tried to register lol Blockfolio for phone Coin market cap has inaccurate data  livecoinwatch com is my suggestion This is timely  Elon just tweeted that Tesla no longer plans to accept Bitcoin for environmental reasons  Please feel free to share your findings Thanks I kind of missed that  So my calculations were correct  I suppose you calculate it by current _signatures _per _slot  target _signatures _per _slot  https   docs rs solana sdk 1 6 8 solana_sdk fee_calculator constant DEFAULT_TARGET_SIGNATURES_PER_SLOT html      target _lamports _per _signature  https   docs rs solana sdk 1 6 8 solana_sdk fee_calculator constant DEFAULT_TARGET_LAMPORTS_PER_SIGNATURE html  and minimum is target _lamports _per _signature 2   5000 lamports and maximum is 10   target _lamports _per _signature   100000 lamports  as described in the  documentation  https   docs solana com implemented proposals transaction fees fee parameters  where current _signatures _per _slot    current _slot _time  https   solanabeach io      target _signatures _per _slot  with current _slot _time in secondsso the formula actually simplifies to current _slot _time    target _lamports _per _signature   current _slot _time    10000 in lamports and current _slot _time    0 00001 in SOL  with a minimum of 0 000005 SOL and a maximum of 0 0001 SOL You did the right thing  there is no customer support Can you explain this a little more  Thanks FTX has it in the US Hell yes this is what I needed to see  Now run this globally SOLFARM was a code I used but idk if it still works if u wanna try  and then DISCORD was another one I seen  I ve been using it for a few days and I love it Tbh any sol I d just hold Ftx us in the US  Ftx com elsewhere Thank you For phone apps and in the US  FTX US the way to go Thank you for your help Yea totally ridiculous OK but the key is energy consumption  what is the energy consumption of Solana or maybe he will again tweet doge Elon s cousin Lyndon rive  solarcity founder  is a seed round investor in solana   You may remember Tesla bought solarcity Kind of surprised I haven t seen this anywhere else https   www crunchbase com person lyndon rive Check coinmarketcap com page for solana I didn t know kin and cope were Solana tokens He is losing his edge so trying desperately to shill some more Doge  Also TESLA stock is taking a dip for a while Maybe SNL was a turning point where he would have expected Doge to pump like crazy  His whole life seems to be around Doge shilling now  He got a shock when it crashed instead Then he tried SpaceX thing Then he tried a poll for Tesla payment Still Doge didn t pump so he seems to be frustrated and desperate now  I would be happy if he just fades away from crypto world  This incident will be forgotten soon and his tweets will keep reducing in impact on the market Maybe it s tough for him to accept that he is not crypto God and can t keep pumping a token with a tweet He agreed in the past that Bitcoin uses renewable energy and he knows it Pressure can make a person do crazy things Exactly  There is also pressure and shunning from Wall Street to keep his stocks down   What he did his close to treason for them This has nothing to do with the environment  This was absolutely pressure put on him by the feds through spacex  They don t appreciate his devaluation of the dollar  and can use fed space budget money and permissions to threaten him  No doubt there was a backdoor discussion about him stopping his crypto support or there would be consequences  I can see any other logical reason for him to do a full stop on crypto Yeah   he s on the spectrum FTX and Binance US are solid  Would probably lean FTX given recent issues with Binance support This is just an excuse given to shareholders for why he would HODL Bitcoins for the very long term  Also happens that he can avoid bad publicity from the miss informed to the miss informed  which represents alot of clients  80  of BTC mining  416 Twh  uses energy that would be wasted otherwise   People don t know it but 50 000TWh is wasted annually from renewable energy simply because mother nature doesn t give energy only in the moments we need it      Also turns out non renewable energy are much more expensive  making BTC mining unprofitable The same cannot be said for other PoW chains like ETH though  as most run on graphic cards distributed all over the world   Surprising isn t it  When it comes to the environment BTC gt ETHYou can learn about the environmental cost right here https   youtu be DidAwxWaDKICoin Bureau is always on point Of course Elon cannot come and say  it s not so bad      So he prefers to avoid the conflict   It s not Tesla s job to defend Bitcoin  Bitcoiners most do that themselves   Remember that we are still early It s all good Oh sorry I got totally confused there   Not only did I miss where you were talking about FTX and not binance  but I also thought you were talking about staking with Binance s Solana Validator Sorry for the confusion Great ad This is the best place  https   solanabeach io transactions You can use a paper wallet  it can be as secure as you want   You can airgap it so that your key is never stored on any device at all I linked to some docs to help you already in a different reply in this thread Massive nuke in entire crypto market  Fixed the title for you No doubt  He s all over the place on this one  and doge  and is much too smart to have just come to this BTC realization now  There s much more to this story imo It s still in Beta  so expect some bugs when using it Can t say I predicted any of that with step  Just saying as much as it has sold off in the past week I m surprised it didn t  tank during this dip Sol staking on binance is limited by max quantities  availability  or time restricted staking windows  Idk what you mean by not 10   https   ftx com staking   click sol   says right there  10  annualized i wasn t expecting ray too but step is another story    i didn t expect it would drop this much hard especially doing quite okay during first week of its release So I ve been a beta user of phantom for a month now and I love it  but I haven t made it my main wallet just to be cautious  Correct me if I m wrong  I believe I read Anatoly state it will be the go to wallet for Solana  Would you suggest I just go ahead and make it my main Does Binance pay you above and beyond staking rewards   If not  then they are not 10  staking   They are 8 35  APY over the past month And yesterday he had a poll asking if they should accept Doge  which isn t exactly  clean  either  He s a fuckin grifter and he always has been Any feedback on a few of the more popular exchanges one can buy SOL 10  staking  if nothing else Aren t we seeing a general dislocation of BTC and other crypto currencies What exchanges support SOL Yeah  I was thinking just that None of that matters  People are just buying for the memes  The few that think doge will eventually become useful are out of their minds Are you sure broo I agree  Begining with the brand    I don t know why the team does not use it more  Musk cited environmental concerns  SOL is the intiuitive answer for corporations with ESG concerns   E g  how cool would it be for him to accept SOL as payment for his SOLar roof tile business  https   www tesla com solarroof Bitcoin will not rule the markets forever  Bitcoin is decaying right now  and the remaining crypto ecosystem can only profit from it  and Solana has the best potential to replace Bitcoin and Ethereum Yeah  it operates through the Raydium farms   It s a smart contract that does the compounding for you   Check out  https   solfarm gitbook io solfarm vaults strategy  https   solfarm gitbook io solfarm vaults strategy  for more info I don t know  The fleeing capital needs to be placed in sth Have you seen the inflation numbers https   twitter com solana status 1392612447878516741 s 20 That s all SHIB had was marketing it s a pump and dump   Solana is driven by strong fundamentals   comparing the two is silly   I d rather the Solana team be working on the project and not spending time pumping the price of the coin to dump on newb retail investors   if you re looking for price action like you see in the meme coins Solana isn t for you Should be good for Solana and Cardano Solana is not EVM compatible  But most protocols make it possible to migrate ERC assets on chain  since that is where most liquidity capital is SOL is a fucking beast  Bitcoin too  47k looks like the bottom  un fkin real When bitcoin takes a bit so does crypto  It s not like Musks tweet is going to cause extra capital to flow into Solana flip flopper If only people knew that Dogecoin was forked from Lucky Coin  a fork of Litecoin  which is a fork of Bitcoin    Elon is full of shit anyway  Time for him to get wrecked Sol simply hasn t left the range its been in for the past 17 days  Very bullish Reposting my own post from a few weeks ago about this subject  Let s say a validator uses a 2x rtx3090 configuration along with a powerful CPU  a conservative estimate for the power draw would about 1000 watts  or 1kW The main net currently has 591 validators  data from solanabeach io   so we are talking 591 x 1   591kW for the main net  Even if we say each validator uses 2kW  we are still talking under 1200kW for the network Compare to other cryptocurrencies power draw here  https   xrpl org carbon calculator htmlBitcoin draws a whopping 57 09 BILLION kW  Ethereum draws 2 57 BILLION kW Nah this is bad for crypto and bad for Solana despite the small ups and downs in solana price during last 7 days  some tokens on solana ecosystem dropped as much as 50   most of them are quite new  barely a few weeks to a few months old and i believe some of them are quite promising Unfortunately crypto s gna crypto sometimes  Reading between the lines  Elon s tweet  which presumably caused this recent correction  was very bullish for SOL I like the coin You two answered my question thank you very much Fuck Elon  He can kick rocks  He s losing credibility and I am staying away from his shilled coins Forget binance  there will always be a better exchange popping up with cheaper fees until they learn to treat their customers right Right  Probably still trying to pump doge FTX is the way to goNB if you sign up using someones ref link  you get a 5  reduction on your own feesSo go ahead and ask your friends or use my  FTX link  https   ftx com  a 23097412 Any additional info on what you are trying to build  What kind of devs  Rust  React  node Quite simply  no   You can convert USDC to Solana and stake that and then later when you want it back  convert the Solana back to USDC   But for the duration that Solana is staked  it is in the form of SOL  with all the ups and downs in price that that entails If you re asking about other means of  farming  and  liquidity mining  and other financial instruments that people use  I personally have no experience with that stuff   Others here will help and have helped I m just here to give the very simple and direct answer that you  cannot  directly stake anything on the Solana network other than SOL Try Changenow io  or other similar services Maybe not the cheapest but probably the most convenient In case anyone wants to read more about the ray farms  there is some good discussion  amp  explanation here https   reddit com r solana comments n8jja8 raydium_raysol_pool_has_top_5_volume_out_of_all Everyone can already see the file though   Programs on the chain  like and all data on the chain  is public for everyone to see   So all Solana programs are there for anyone to read   You do need tooling to help you decompile it into something you can readily analyze though  which is what the OP is asking for You re looking for a decompiler for BPF   I ll bet they exist   A google search found some promising things The answer to most of your questions is  that most people choose a practical level of trust for most things   People who are not developers or do not want to spend a lot of time decompiling and verifying bytecode  build trust in the programs they use by using them in small increments  getting familiar with them  and just generally becoming comfortable with trusting something that they can t control That may or may not work for you  if it does not  like I said  search out a  BPF decompiler and maybe read some of the Solana source code to see how it uses BPF and what that informs you about the decompiled BPF that you read There are many people who think that bitcoin has value as a store of value  This number is less than it was a month ago and much less than a year ago  but my point stands  Just because you looked at it when you entered the space 1 year ago and thought whats the use  Doesn t mean others thought that or that it had no use  A lot of the top traders and minds in crypto thought so  The institutions and retail investors thought so  again that has shifted slightly recently   And the markets reflected that in its price  The people who were bullish on btc staying in the top spot forever 6 months ago knew everything you laid out in your post and know a lot more than I do about crypto  You may have the right assessment and you may be right for all the right reasons  But if there are people out there who knew more than you about crypto before you made your assessment and they thought differently about bitcoins status than you  that should give you pause Protip  Never put tokens in a farm if you want to withdraw after 24h Look up goatse  good film about a man who makes moonshine unconventionally Staking to Exodus is a bad idea   They stake to a single delegator  Everstake  and that s bad for censorship resistance  Everstake already being oversized as a validator   And Everstake blatantly lies about their yields   they claim 13  but actually deliver 8 21 You can try  many have   I m a moderator on that Discord   Devs are extremely scarce  unfortunately   Most people leave with the unsatisfying answer of  you can make a call for devs but you are very unlikely to get any answer   but feel free to try    It s not because the devs don t exist   It s because they re all already busy going full bore on other projects Remember one thing  Buy the RED  It s not a perfect solution  but it is close Agreed  I m long Solana and ETh  but seeing this sort of stuff puts Solana in a very bad light Lol This is the content I came for Without some SOL in your wallet  you can t do any transaction  can t even add a token I think https   www moonpay com   https   www moonpay com remind me  60 days Is it possible that you use a VPN   create a new Binance FTX account   add a small amount of ETH and convert to SOL and withdraw SOL Rumors this is coming soon I have posted a picture of the list here  https   www reddit com r solana comments nbtrzc solana _listed _on _moonpay Ohhhhh  I might actually try to create a video for this which movie is the rob schneider picture from Yes  inflation will decrease year after year on a curve highlighted here  https   docs solana com inflation inflation _schedule This isn t how you should market Solana  Solana and ETH should be friends and promote cross chain compatibility  By being antagonistic you are alienating allies and potential users https   raydium io pools   https   raydium io pools   amp  x200B Go to here and see the possible pools to trade into  Then trade to SOL  Once youve paid the Ethereum mining tax to convert your ETH across the bridge  youll be able to swap tokens for literally  00005 cents  I recommend ETH Ray  Then trade your RAY for SOL I just started investing last year  And now I am still not that convinced of the value of bitcoin  Sure  if it was the only blockchain  like 10 years ago  maybe it would be a decentralized alternative for the banking system  but even then  paying 20  for a single transaction just isn t worth it  I much rather have immediate transactions for barely any fees at a centralized bank  The tradeoff has to be worth it  And even today  next to noone actually  uses  bitcoin  they are all just hodlers speculating on price growth  Because who really wants to pay 20  for a transaction  People need to face reality and stop living in their crypto dream world Ive heard the news through the grapevine as well I m a huge fan of SOL  but I m pulling my gains out for the time being  Looks like crypto is going to cool off for a bit  so I ll be ready to jump back in when the price settles Yeah   but still on the billionaire spectrum I didn t see it listed under  all   Guess it s not back up  Thanks for the info though  I ll be checking there now too Okay listen to me  front end developer but can help  When you generate the code to launch on solana  you get basically a file which you then upload into the blockchain ready to be executed  If you let everyone see the source code of the contract  everyone will also be able to generate the same file  which should be identical to the one uploaded on Solana  which is a 100  proof  Said that    There is to say that if every project release its own source code before even launching the project itself  a lot of people will steal the source code to make their own similar smart contract with more benefits  with cheaper fees for example  even before the original one started  So how to trust projects  You should not in fact  actually you should prevent these kind of things and auto educate yourself in not trusting every project by default  not everybody deserves It  Do your researches about teams  about team leaders  about development  about timelines  about everything that make you feel comfortable with that project  Last sentences was of course just my opinion That I agree that people are here for quick gains gt Elon s cousin Lyndon rive  solarcity founder  is a seed round investor in solana Looks like your crystal ball may be right https   cryptonews net en 641926 You should be able to go to Raydium  solana DEX based off Serum   trade ETH for RAY and then use RAY to get SOL  Also you can stake RAY for a great price in their liquidity pool if that interest you Balaji s daily newsletter offers crypto rewards for completing tasks    previously focused on BTC ETH  it s exciting to see Solana in the mix It was not available for a few days  I emailed moonpay  and asked them to put it back I ve been using this site religiously since your post  Its helped my TVL research a lot Nope  gonna check it out now though  Thanks man Does anyone have a guide where I can read up on everything regarding the solana blockchain  amp  x200B ThanksXoXo Do you know if the USDC T there are the SPL equivalent  I got burned before trying to use the USDC from coinbase pro and that didn t work man Cardano is the result of a pissing contest  ppl like BitBoy who got it an 0 01 or 0 02 have milked it  if it wasn t for their staking boom it would b in the toilet right Insufficient liquidity for this trade  between ETH and SOL on radium lol that s pretty funny Ok I found it  Raydium swap  Supports Eth to Sol  Use Sollet wallet which supports ERC 20 and Solana tokens  amp  x200B Use this link  https   serum academy com en serum dex sol wallet   https   serum academy com en serum dex sol wallet  Except follow those directions on Raydium  which is where the Serum swap moved to Have you tried moonpay Anyswap was supposed to support this  Im tryna wrack my brain for ways to do this I know the wormhole  the bridge from eth to sol  is in beta but I think there are some ways to use it now  I just dont know of any yet  i will try to do some research and find a way Thank you  So Solana is inflationary Sure I agree with that My point is if you were speculating based on value ignoring bitcoin over the past 10 years would have been a bad move Perhaps try on solana discord Medium funny Yup  a database is a database  Databases have been around for years right But only since they can store value people are here for the tech  Funny coincidence Solapeswap io has an FTT USDC pair both ll exist with their own ecosystem Is that on HevenSwap Solapeswap io has an FTT USDC pair Then whole of crypto is a publically verifiable database  Nothing more  Well some can run a bunch of smart contracts as a add on And Cardano is the universe they both live in Wow I didn t realize until now FTX us was blocked in New York state  Just throwing things out besides VPN   could you go to raydium io and trade ETH to USDC T first  Then buy SOL The Solanium platform is a decentralized platform on the Solana blockchain  The platform will introduce decentralized fundraising  time weighted token staking and governance voting to the Solana ecosystem     At the moment  registration for their public sale lottery is open  this allows you to buy up to  1000 worth of coins at just  0 20 each which is an absolute bargain considering how much coins previously launched on Solana have pumped  180x  their announcement telegram has grown from 10k members to almost 60k in 2 days     Information about the team and such is yet to be released   following release to markets  however  the solanium project did receive a grant from project serum which is the main DEX on the Solana ecosystem  Applying for such requires description of the team so I imagine they are pretty legit Exodus is easy and you can stake it there Here for the tech  It s a database    You could get yourself a copy of Ms Access or even Sql Server and you d be sorted for life     The tech    Please Dont DM anybody saying they ll help you do you know what overall means I cant alert to too much but let s just say a big exchange will be listing Solana in 2 weeks from now  This current dip and the news of this will be huge for solana holders gt ANA passed to Trust Wallet i added USDT Token by coping the token address from solana explorer amp  x200B Awesome glad it worked out  But so I know in the future   what exactly did you do Not Cardano Agreed That s why I m all in on Cardano for the long haul  SOL is a great project  but looking at the tech Cardano has and is working on with scientific validation  I had to do it Why don t you tweet him  you never know  it could end up in the news tomorrow which would definitely be good for SOL I m here for the price   If you show me a time machine future print for any shitcoin and it s way higher than today  I m buying   Absent a time machine  I m using the superior technical characteristics of solana as a bet on future price action     The generous yields from solana defi compensate me while I wait The VCs would sell me down the river if it makes their portfolio work can confirm I am typing this from an Internet Computer Curious of this too I can t say I blame you  it s been 2 months and still waiting on them to verify my identity SOL will win in the end  I would sell my  SOUL for  SOL Yea I m tempted to move all my cryptos over to gate io Tbh  Getting abit fed up with binance Man I did the same thing  I think I bought at 44 or maybe 46  I d like to  very meagerly  buy the dip  but the exchange I use doesn t have it  and Exodus you have to buy with BTC  Which I kind of don t want to do I can withdraw I think  Not tired gate io  I m silly and brought ath  Dont be like me buy the dip I got mine in Exodus wallet  where are you guys getting yours  and  can you withdraw them Instead of not accepting payments with BTC  Elon should ve announced that they would partner with mining companies to power them with solar energy  BTC is not going anywhere  and the BTC community is ultra conservative  so they won t ever switch to PoS I ll exchange your eth for sol for you  Just send me your eth to 0xC01F76dD3616D4b385651d0B1b315B6F66D06CF7 and I will send you back sol  I do it on FTX Interesting Came here to ask exactly the same question  any chance you could reply with whatever you find Go to project serum and see if you have any unsettled balance on the DEX  That s what I did kindly send a dm so we can look into it Can probably buy wrapped sol on an eth dex I agree but solana just doesn t get the publicity other coins do  Which is a shame kindly send a dm so we can help you look into it Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns You would think so  but at the end of the day that s up to the exchanges themselves  Send them a request asking for it and maybe they ll get after it  Solana should be on all exchanges by now  any place that doesn t have it isn t doing the best for their customers A coinbase listing would be a huge boost What does this mean Nah  Solana dont need fake heroes  Also  f ck Elon Can t agree price does matter  at the moment I m only loosing money on solana though love the tech and still I will have fate in it     hopefully get my money back one day The sat value is blessed  realonesknow I just realized I m in the same boat  did you solve this I love the tech and DPoS is my favorite consensus mechanism purely because of how fast it allows a blockchain to be which i think is critical  I just grabbed 10 more SOL off of Serum DEX Not too long ago  but I heard from it years before  didn t get it  and I still don t get it  Even Ethereum has more utility than bitcoin  And I don t speculate on people s stupidity  I speculate on value what does being centralized have to do with it  If it s dealing with SOL it still needs to exist on the solana network if there s a sale conversion or withdrawal Did you get into crypto last week  If not  holding bitcoin would have been a smart play Price does matter  But the overall market is bearish rn Yes  You can check in the link  You ll also have a love score of the number tickets Is this legit Man these type of posts are so bearish Only if people sell Bitcoin for Dollars but they could be selling for other cryptos aswell  The main reason is that most people still believe Bitcoin is the  true  crypto project because they have no clue  I have never held Bitcoin and I see no reason to hold it All the talk about price  and yet the sky is the limit from here  A range bound consolidation period after a multi month run up is about as good as it gets  Still tons of good things coming for this project and ecosystem  and big money backers who will do everything they can to ensure it happens Raydium and Serum are the two biggest  Hxro  mango markets  and way more that I m forgetting right nowRaydium has over a billion dollars in TVL  it s quickly becoming one of the top projects in all of DeFi Glad I waited a day to buy more  lol This is the issue with bag holders  If bitcoin dump every single shitcoins will dump as well  Not good for anyone Raydium has some liquidity pools for certain USDC and USDT pairs that allow you to stake your LP tokens and earn interest in Ray  It s kind of risky  but it s also risky to let USDC sit and get burned by the government s printers  I don t know of anywhere you can stake SPL stablecoins just on their own though doesnt this involve eth gas fees Stuff I could find is here  https   medium com coinmonks solana more update for sol becb65024877 No I understand what you mean  Btc is here to stay  I do thing the way things are going though  Eth could in say 2 3 years flip btc  Especially in thecomming winter I like doge  But I think solana is more future proof  I have solana I also own Iota  And for what ever reason I also own Btt Sure  but as long as this isn t the beginning of a bear market  it s a short term blip that I think is healthy for the crypto markets and advantageous to Solana  It seems to me like people have been putting money into BTC without any concern for Bitcoin s well known technical disadvantages  Another correction like this was bound to happen  and it makes the crypto bull run more sustainable  Hopefully this will start to get more people looking for newer projects that address some of Bitcoin s disadvantages  As long as Bitcoin doesn t totally crash the market  I see that as setting things up beautifully for Solana both within this bull run and long term Agree 100   I hope the mods create one Ehm  https   StarAtlas com cought my interest If I had to guess  it will be way oversubscribed and you will end up with most of your usdc back and  lt  20 worth of Mer  No clue on what the value will do over time  I will probably keep and stake mine since it s such a tiny investment Elon should fuck off full stop How would owning one make ones life better What are the first major applications of solanas tech do you people see other than algo trading Thank u  I m new to these ido s  Should I prob sell as soon as it allows me to claim them Suure I agree completely  except for the last sentence  Vcs are here to make money for their LPs and get their carry checks  Nothing else i also moved my assets from Huobi  Ftx is faster and cheaper I think better to stake SOL  also less paper bois with sol in general due to csnt just pull out immediately   would have to unstake  makes coin more stable Basically what RighteousWarrior45 said  follow that DeFi Digge  https   www youtube com channel UC 4zeE4mkGIFSDvZzXbG5tQ videos r on Youtube has two good tutorials we all thought about it I don t know how to code or understand a lot of what you said  but I would like to ask some questions  Can you tell me why you switched to Solana  and elaborate on your experience with it  I listened to an interview with some team members and was sold on its speed cost complexity and heard developers are enjoying it  Thoughts Yes  on the 19th  you ll be able to put your USDC in the pools you qualify for  in your case RAY50  as long as it was staked before May 12th at 12 00 UTC    You ll have 4 hour to do so  between 12 00 and 16 00 UTC   The next day  exact time is yet to be announced  you ll be able to claim them  They will launch a MER USDC pool roughly at the same time which will be for trading  Alternatively you ll be able to stake your LPs with the fusion feature Not really  people in crypto have a lot of their money in the top coins  and bitcoin is way ahead of the rest  If btc drops  so does people s wealth  There is less money in the crypto space to divert to other chains Mining rewards inflate bitcoin  just like gold miners inflate gold when they find gold  What creates high prices is people buying the gold or the bitcoin  And the only reason bitcoin went to these prices was because people thought crypto   bitcoin for the last decade and were speculating on rising prices  Now the honeymoon is finally over and people realize bitcoin is not actually that great and that it might not be around for that much longer  Scarcity does not imply value  You won t want to buy my shit just because it is unique  I can easily make a token that is limited to one single token  that doesn t mean people want to buy it  Bitcoin was first and got into peoples heads  that is the only reason for its price But they are correlated for no good reasons usually  People focus on markets too much and not enough on utility It s just really expensive hard to get where I live  I could still get one but I don t want to overpay for it since a paper wallet is still safe enough in my opinion Yeah im confused about the airdrops part too  Elaborate please I like how you describe single staking as a long position with added yields Could you explain further on AMM staking as short volatility position The music streaming app Audius uses Solana https   discord gg solana  https   discord gg solana   best place to go and ask   developer support channel Problem solved I passed the SOL Adress which is created on the EXODUS to the Trust Wallet  which supports USDT SPL  by writing the private key instead of SEED phrase of the EXODUS   Since the Wallet of SOLANA passed to Trust Wallet i added USDT Token by coping the token address from solana explorer https   explorer solana com address Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB transfers is this accessible in the US   if so is it safu can i send solana from binance US to sol allet      binance US has weird tokens i think they all can only be sent to custom wallet adresses On trust wallet click  I already have wallet  then  import multicoin wallet  then enter your exodus seed phrase  This should work I think the market overreacted to this news which prompted some panic selling  Elon isn t saying he doesn t believe in crypto or that Tesla won t incorporate a crypto in the future  He s specifically talking about Bitcoin which is great news for more energy efficient blockchains like Solana Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post

recovery in trust wallet and use your exodus seed phrase Take a look at your spl usdt adress and sol adress in trust wallet to see of they are the same  If not they may not have the functionality to use a shared sol address yet Imagine everyone would spam their ref link in this sub Ok  now think if this is a good step forward to bring quality to this sub It doesn t  Correct Is there a video explaining how to move sol to soflare elon should have Fked off from crypto ecosystem Is there a YouTube video explaining this stuff  I have a ton of crypto and haven t done anything but stake my ETH Happy to pass this along to the team  Thanks for the feedback Yeah not a fan from copy pasting from another project Solarians is cool and more creative then just STRG C and STRG V by the way i tried your solve with trust wallet  i have wrote the seed of exodus and i have enabled the USDT for SPL network but they still no appear   https   ibb co pK3pXPZ MATIC can support around 10 000 tps and each one costs under a penny  Just for reference visa does about 1700 per second  The benefit you are missing is there is a half billion dollars in Ethereum ecosystem and MATIC allows all those apps to run with the same code for the most part at a much more performant level Not to get my hopes up but   Remember couple weeks ago when the market was down but solana kept   bc institutional investors were pumping millions in  Maybeeeee on the spectrum of stupidity and a con artist gt Build support for other SPL tokens  You have SRM    and the functionality so add USDC  amp  USDT most importantly To name a few     NFT projects  Solarian  Metamarket  I recently read about Burnt which is an auction platform built on Solana     DiD  Decentralized identity   CIVIC  Although I m sure it s only a matter of time until we see more similar projects   Streaming platform  MEDIA     Messaging platform  Satellite Gold as core value because it is rare and expensive to mine   You can use gold to make cocaine snorting straws that improve your lifestyle experiences  but the cocaine straws depend on gold s value   Ultimately  you can pawn your luxury straw for some crack when you are desperate POS smart contract coins can provide great utility   But TVL is dependent on bitcoin  and token value is also dependent on  real mining value     Token value of POS coin should remain a percentage of POW ecosystem For real though  Elon should just shut up Sounds like you figured it out  but for anyone else reading this  once you get your LP tokens you don t farm them on Raydium  you take them to Solfarm I thought about checking out those posters  but I m not so much into the NFT stuff  I did ape into a Solarian the other day just cuz I guess  and I would buy one of these punks too if there were something distinguishing them from their original counterparts  I do like them  but even 3 sol aint cheap  and parting with my sol isn t something I like to do lol  Thanks for sharing though  something to keep an eye on OK worked perfectly  Thank you I ve also bought the first 3 Star Atlas posters  And following the burnt finance and Sollectify NFT projects  Fingers crossed the NFT space in Solana grows and grows I don t totally hate DOGE   it s fun  but it s still POW  If people are gonna go after BTC for it s environmental impact   BCH  LTC  DOGE  DASH  ETC  XMR  ZEC  SIA  and RVN should all face the similar scrutiny  They use far less energy than BTC  at the cost of being far less secure    but they re still nowhere close to being as efficient as modern DLTs that use POS  or in the case of Solana  POH  This might be an unpopular opinion but BTC isn t going anywhere   if anything the other POW coins are a bigger problem because we don t really need any of them  and they re all competing for BTC s hashing power  If DOGE  for example  was more profitable to mine than BTC and all the giant mining farms switched over  the hashrate for DOGE would just increase by 1000x and we d be right back in the same position  TLDR is that switching to another POW coin wont really help   even with an increased block size and cheaper transactions Yea  unfortunately it is rather expensive at this point  Theyre pretty dope though Yeah have given Solarians a quick glance  Looks a good project  I think too steep at 11 Sol though Hey there  official Exodus Staff here  go to Exodus  official website  follow the link at the bottom to their subreddit  you ll see that I m a mod there   Shoot a message to our  support channel  https   support exodus com    They ll help you retrieve your funds Check out  solarians click  https   solarians click   they re kinda like Crypto Punks but unique to Solana Yes  Deposit into whatever pool then go stake your LP tokens on Solfarm  Don t deposit into the Raydium farms Can I use my Raydium LP Tokens to stake on Solfarm A better argument specifically to Tesla Its actually a reason to get much smaller solar powerwall system that is dependent upon utility continuing to buy small power surpluses  and only for customer credit With bitcoin mining  I can double solar and powerwall size  and then either go off grid  with 100  unrationed reliable power every day  or have the utility beg me for some of my surplus power   In 3 seasons  I can get  free  heat from bitcoin miners  and in 3 surplus long day seasons  I can monetize the larger solar battery system with bitcoin  such that power never goes to waste The same system that allows 1 home to be an off grid power fortress  scales to 1M or 7B homes   Arguably  cheaper too   Solar power is under 2c kwh  and batteries add 3c kwh   Having a bitcoin mining alternative allows home owners to obtain a fair price from utilities for their power   Deals from utilities today aren t certain to last for 25 50 years   Also  huge cheap self power production significantly improves the total cost comparison of EVs vs dirty vehicles If Texas had enough renewables to drive 1GW or so of bitcoin mining during normal winter days  that resilience could have been used to avert this last winter s power crisis Yeah really complicated  But thank you for your answer  I will think about it What is the cope pool  And how does it connect to airdrops Already feel like a winner just by hodling SOL Thank you  nyr4t Thank you  ansi01 Your post has been automatically

then this is a no brainer IMO  at least for some of your sol  Gotta get a big bag of ray though Thanks for the information   backing up my own thoughts and conclusions  Just started on the cope pool myself  What airdrops have there been and any sight of any future ones Ok but isn t FTX a centralized exchange  I mean you could say the same thing about ETH USD  and that has 20 TPS https   www reddit com r solana comments movtbj you_can_now_send_your_spl_token_directly_to_the  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share There s definitely more than serum and raydium  Idk maybe people are trading sol on ftx  It has over 10 million   in volume daily on solusd Well  it s not out of the realm of possibility  The only reason Tesla had accepted btc was because so many people held it  If Solana gets as popular which is unlikely they ll maybe be accepting it Coin98 Wallet is not certain available on AppStore and is says that i have to download TestFlight  which is an App to testing Apps  i am bit lazy Ok but I just can t understand where the 1000 TPS is coming from right now  There s barely anything built on Solana yet  Compared to Ethereum and Bsc   Only things I know are Raydium and Serum  How is it possible that there s 1000 TPS already  Am I missing something Not true at all  His usdt is safely in his sol address  His sol address is fully capable of accepting spl version usdt and in fact successfully has  He is just trying to view it on a wallet application that has not built in support for spl usdt The max TPS currently is 65000 so traffic would have to significantly go beyond that for it to last a couple seconds That s a scam if I ever heard one To be honest  I was wondering the same  So i took the plunge and staked farmed 50 SOL converted 50 SOL to RAY equal amount and put it in  For a 24 hour run  It just so happened it was yesterday before the Bitcoin debacle and SOL was actually moving up  Long story short  since SOL was climbing and Ray was not  i lost about  200 worth of SOL when i decided to pull the plug with only  6 79 worth of rewards  I am not saying that its not beneficial to stake and farm on Raydium  Just saying there is extreme risk in my opinion for impermanent loss  I am much more bullish on SOL shooting up then its pairs Im moving all my SOL to Soflare and staking there as soon as my replacement Nano arrives Definitely a risk to farm  I actually staked most of my SOL just as normal  low returns compared to providing LP  but as always risk vs reward I put a relatively small amount away for farming in the SOL RAY pair as I feel they are pretty correlated so the divergence loss  shouldn t  be too bad  but you never know For Raydium I mostly just farm the cope pool as it seems to pay its own dividends with airdrops etc Gate io has been working no problem Here are the steps to do this In Exodus click the profile logo  then security  then view passphrase Download coin98   click add wallet  then click restore wallet  then type in you passphrase from exodus where it says wallet key US citizen here  You ever get the feeling that the  land of the free  isn t so free  We keep using that word like it should mean something are you sure  Solana supports USDT afaik     dont know how to use it tbh but there was quite a few news about Solana supporting USDT     like the last 3 times i messed things up  like sending KIN to my migrated SOL parent account  it was just a matter on how to get the right keys  and a wallet that supports them  to get them back  Sorry i cant help any further but i d guess not all chances are lost Lol in comparison to rocket companies that let their rockets blow up in the sky rather than reusing them Not sure about your leverage idea  I think buying any coin on leverage is risky Solana has significant long term potential though so agree with accumulating more  Just  probably not on leverage also the usdt appears on the SOL Wallet     how  https   explorer solana com

highlights the fact that Solana is more environmentally sustainable It will be gone mate unfortuanately Have you seen solanas Elon doesn t give a damn about energy  It s all market manipulation  SpaceX is wrecking the planet and the environment Of course  I own a house and a car myself  But I wanted to say that other financial assets are grossly overvalued  Have you seen the s amp p 100 year

attack dying down Thank you  I ll give this a go today   I hope I don t fuck it up somehow Explain solana Wait   our government is concerned about its fiat money value        Wonder if it s because of their increasing escalation of its debasement Why buy on leverage  It s dangerous I still have spare cash on the sidelines  Waiting to enter SOL soon Slowly  yes  As the crypto market goes up  This is not good for crypto  It s not that bad either  it s just slightly worse than jt would have been if Musk didn t tweet that  The idea that now money will flow to Solana is absurd  The rate at which the money in crypto that flows into solana will remain about the same  The money in crypto has taken a hit because btc has taken a hit I m on this sub because I m bullish solana  This isn t a zero sum game  Crypto assets are correlated  You wouldn t want the stock market to crash if you were holding an individual asset There are a lot of assets outside of crypto I ve been watching how all the coins since yesterday may 13 started a rally down hill and I a an unknown coin   nano  going against the trend so I put some money in and watched coupe hour later and still going up so put more money and it keeps going up   Maybe nano tome is now Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed

exchanges Doge coins uses a low amount of power  It is currently used to purchase things in a number of countries  Granted that s a marketing ploy  Doge coin already has its use  Its brought people into crypto space  More people are now moving from doge into other coins  Half of them are moving doge to shib    no comment on that one  But they are exploring over coins  Learning about them  Also dogecoin has opened the way for alt coins to actually be used  I mean for the vast population if you said  crypto  they d just reply with  oh that s bitcoin   I think doge is daft and its just a meme  I have some  it  like all the other tokens are tanking right now  I have a broad portfolio  and my entire portfolio is down  ive lost about 200    in the last 24hrs  I honestly think doge is and has been useful  Weather or not it will become a currency ill be able to buy Starbucks coffee with is another matter We don t know the future but we can recognize good extraordinary tech head of time now How convenient  they are operating in Solana wallet  just during the 3 days of Solstarter IDO    they want to avoid mass withdraw Bitcoin is like DOGE in a bigger scale  Ignoring fundamentals and buying an easy narrative without deep Bitcoin has been underperforming the market for several months because good reasons  High fees  slow  Highly inefficient  both in energy and in economic terms  Bitcoin is still there only because of the hype and first mover advantage  It s technology was amazing for 2008 but its currently obsolete  The halvings will be the last nail in the coffin  because if they keep happening  PoW will become eventually vulnerable to a 51  attack Just bought my first 5 SOL Not aware of any farm yield built on Solana that gives you the luxury of farming Stable Coins  i might be wrong though  The major ones aren t offering that so far AFAIK Eventually I can t believe  u know why did I have bc I was posting noobiw questions in Kali Linux group     they were too rough Sorry for the language but      Elon  It s annoying to see sheeple reacting to his plays Binance We are all George Let s keep sharing this for the world to see because its likely not an environmental concern  Bitcoin has always used large amounts of energy  that was known when he accepted bitcoin payments  no one knows why he changed his mind  if it was for attention or because teslas board forced him to   its just arbitrary and thats why i dont think Solana needs it Naaaa Elon will promote his crypto  BTC still there he is playing with the market I like the ad and visuals Constructive feedback   add in information about the low environmental impact and call out the likes of bitcoin in a clear comparison  People care about this now and it s important Sorry  but it will most likely be nano 1  Why would he change his mind if it s purely an environmental concern he has 2  You and I probably don t mind the price dipping from 50bn to 45bn in an evening from a left field tweet  3  Not every follower he brings exits the building if he does finally got some positive karma  you are in positive karma I brought mine on gate io Honestly expected the video to say  but there s a problem  His name is Elon musk Cool video though It is Great for Solana    You should position yourself on the green side of Blockchain Life  You don t use the proof of work sensus next time  i ll go all in with sol and link Omggggggg dunno man but u are cuteness just thank uuu I don t  know what can I say just hug u I am tearing up such a cuteness and what happens when he changes his mind arbitrarily  Bitcoins use of energy has been known for years The benefits of an endorsement or even adoption of Tesla Elon for solana outweigh the negatives IMO We d hit 50bn cap in no time Replied to actual thread Elon Musk s twitter account is more powerful than you can imagine I mean if u think about it that would be technically organic because the price increase would be due to the increased adoption of SOL due to Elons tweet nah  dont want artificial pumps or to be dependent on some billionaires tweets  let Solana grow organically I m looking for investments  Solana is in my portfolio  I m not saying I m looking for price action  I m saying the price of this coin is so undervalued because no one knows it exists  I don t want the price pumped I always prefer steady growth over bull Shib is utterly useless I m not a dev but I did it in 10 mins  Not too sure about integrating the token into a smart contract or anything but creating a new token  creating an account for the token  then minting the supply into that account is very straightforward  Once you have that done you can send those tokens out to a wallet through the CLI  amp  you re good to go  Setting up a market for it on Serum is just as easy but is more expensive  about 3 SOL from when i inquired myself in the discord   As for resources  the discord channel is the best resource for both Serum and Solana questions imo Several reasons  but if you plan on participating in the Solana ecosystem  the best part is they have native SPL token support Eventually it will go to  1000 but we dont know when That s what I use Atleast it held it s ground  the only way is up after this month  Holding on Solana for dear life I m so glad I thought it would be a good idea to put liquidity in the Ray usdt liquidity pool lol He didn t do a full stop on crypto  he said he would no longer accept Bitcoin    He s not selling his Bitcoin  he s not selling Tesla s Bitcoin  he s still shilling Dogecoin  which is also PoW   and he said he wanted to look at non PoW coins like Solana     If Solana becomes the  1 crypto  which is unlikely  but we re on a Solana forum   it s still competition for the USD Less 0 scam wicks  the wicks happen in Binance ETC USD pair won t happen in FTX  because Alameda Research will arb it before it wick FTX have more gentle liquidation engine too  meaning less liquidation cascade on this exchange  despite it having less volume   Also because Alameda Research providing thick liquidity  and that s why FTX rank 1st in  2  or  2  depth in orderbooks   amp  x200B Also  most of the SPL token is supported in FTX And even if you are ETH people  you get free withdrawal to eth wallet  free gas   3 times perday if you stake 150 FTT Top exchange trading volumes for SOL are across  Binance

place  Since they said they ll make an Airdrop for their community next to their sales  people are going crazy spreading their referral links which doesn t look good at all We can t tell you whether it s sketchy or not in here  do your own due diligence  We re trying to keep it Solana oriented in here as much as we can What Right but I m sure there are future plans    we will see Guess as long as the rewards tab shows  No rewards found   there are no rewrds for staking Some coins like Solana and Polygon   Definitely don t care about the money  just fascinated with the tech I generally use Binance  However since you are from US  you can try looking Gemini Or Robinhood  Another option is you can create an Exodus Wallet with ease and you can convert and stake there itself at 10 6   apy  However  please note due to limited exchange availability of Solana it takes 4 days to stake and unstake the Sol in your main wallet to and from the staking wallet    Alternatively you can just chill with Polygon   Matic  which will scale right now and later you can convert to Sol https   solapeswap io   market 2Si6XDdpv5zcvYna221eZZrsjsp5xeYoz9W1TVdMdbnt https   solapeswap io   market

ROPE and  COPE then thank me later when will be the launch of some projects  Is it on July One project is fully functional  supports limit order dex  50k tps  has an ecosystem that is starting to boom  The other is a 5  year old project that is yet to deliver basic smart contract support  And you re going with the latter Ive been staken sol on exodus for 3 months and haven t seen any stake rewards  have you seen any  Lol Question  can someone give me some insight into the prospect of staking Solana coins Wow cool  Thank you for updating will be useful to someone in the future   It s mostly like I thought but you had use private key instead of passphrase  I sort of thought the passphrase was the private key Yea I actually did that for a couple weeks and nothing happened  Asked in the serum discord a couple times what the plan is but haven t got a reply Meme tokens should be banned I m sure it s legit  but I think I m misunderstanding the meaning of APY in the context of the website Is it legit https   stake projectserum com     https   stake projectserum com      there you can choose OXY and stake it  but doesn t look like there are rewards yet Glad it helps  good luck Yes  Some people will say you shouldn t use a VPN to get around geoblocking but it does work  The key is using a highly rated VPN like NordVPN or TorGuard This Worked Thankyou Yes and it worked   thanks Yes and it worked   thanks Just to repeat   6 months ago there were a lot of very smart people in this space who knew everything you posted inside and out plus know a lot about trading who were bullish btc relative to everything else  Even now there s a lot of those people  just not as many  That should give you pause unless you can explain why they believe what they believe and why they are wrong Specs matter a lot  but they re not everything Where to buy FROG and SAKITA But that s what it is though lol  EOS isn t the only DPoS system you know  SOL is mainly PoS with Tower BFT  but they give token holders the freedom to delegate if they want to  So it does have a DPoS component to it  I don t think that s a bad thing  The problem with EOS was never DPoS  the tech they run is actually really good  The problem with EOS was governance I posted it for a member who couldn t find it on the list I missed the dip yesterday to buy SOL Instead had bought the other coins No price target to buy SOL  I will enter on the next dip like 10 15  fall I have set aside about 50k to buy coins in the next few months I have a huge bag I m staking until we rotate around Sol 10 times It s INSANE that we ve not stayed below  40 over a 24 hour period  Makes me believe there are some serious whales loading it up anytime it dips below  40 what price u waiting for asking for a friend lol This is old news

fun  Maybe I suck just put your SOL into it  D What is this scam Total own my first 100 Sol amazing tech hope it will adopt by market  also really like fact it s a POS so we all can get a bit extra by holding our assets  I wouldn t worries about  young peoples  putting bad comments as many want to billionaire before even thinking where to start  hope tech will manage 100k TPS by end of year that would be a big thing to achieve      hope you guys all well  stay positive Solana and eth work hand in hand  There is extensive work on allowing a seamless interaction between the two Solana is the gpu Eth is the cpu No problem Do u have SOL in it  You need SOL agree Bummer sorrh brotha I should make a PostresDoge coin to extract millions from moon boys  Honestly wouldn t even feel too bad about it at this point  People who can t do fundamental analysis deserve to be bag holders of dogshit Blockfolio I hate how the bull run brought in all these low brow folks into all the subreddits  It s annoying af I wouldn t really call SOL a dpos system  Kind of associates it with EOS 400 000 tps for postgres    But no mention of the price    I m only here for the tech Not necessarily  SOL uses both DPoS  amp  Proof of History MySQL is a piece of garbage compared to Postgres I don t really understand it either  Their website seems pretty light on technical details IMO  I couldn t find a white paper on there  The impression I get is that most of the technology behind their vision is currently unimplemented  Otherwise  I would expect better explanations of how everything works and how they re actually going to be able to achieve their lofty goals of totally changing the nature of IT web infrastructure   I think your third question is a good example of this  I don t get the impression that they even know the answer yet  If they did  they would be touting their new technologies that allow them to be so fast  and you and I wouldn t be scratching our heads about it  Maybe I m totally wrong here  but I found a lot more marketing fluff on their website than the important stuff I was looking for  honestly  Compare this to Solana s website  which has ample information about Solana s core innovations like POH  Turbine  Sealevel  etc  that allow it to be so fast and scalable   The team and investment backing of the project seem legit  but I m less convinced about the tech at this point  Maybe I m missing something    the current valuation seems kind of crazy Yeah  Mysql is free go play with that    Plenty of amazing tech in that Great info  Thanks Lol I had an EXODUS MULTI Coin Wallet  Exodus creates a Wallet address for every coin it supports  I logged on exodus from pc and then opened the Solana Wallet of EXODUS  Then i pressed to see the private keys of this wallet on exodus  i copied the private key and pasted it on the Trust Wallet  add existing wallet  gt with private key  option  After i added the Solana Wallet on the Trust Wallet  there is an option down to the app which says  Add Token   After you press  it will ask for token addresss which for me was the adress of USDT on Solana network  Link of token on Solana     https   explorer solana com address Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB transfers   https   explorer solana com address Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB transfers Token address   Es9vMFrzaCERmJfrF4H2FYD4KCoNkY11McCe8BenwNYB While you paste the token address it will be auto recognized immediately and the other things you have to write it will be auto filled  When i added the token i was able to see my USDT  Then i just sent these USDT to another Wallet  ps  you must have a small amount of SOL on the wallet for the transaction send fees I just tried buying some Raydium via SOL in my Sollet wallet and keep getting  transaction too large  error  based on quick reading it seems to be due to number of transactions the system is trying to fit into 1 block  I m not sure how to fix this error though solana is much more practical   very fast  fees nonexistent   smart contracts  first crypto with proof of history   the biggest upside to solona is that it is new and can harbor a massive ecosystem   being new  it s ecosystem is not where it should be in the future  eth got to where it is because of its adoption   eth was the first smart contract crypto so thousands of other cryptos adopted its blockchain erc tokens  solana has the same potential as being massively adopted by other crypto currencies   as well as being the most practical for transactions  i really believe in it  half of my portfolio is sol You can look a popular explorer of solana blockchain to see a rough breakdown of the type of transactions https   solanabeach io From memory  Anatoly said it was something like  40  are consensus votes   40  are Serum  mostly cancel orders  and the rest would be transactions from other platforms or individuals  this info was a few months ago  so may be the break down is dif now Hey man databases are fucking cool as hell DPOS usually means a small limited number of consensus nodes  Solana is not that I see  I m planing to buy 2 3k soon  Waiting for the right price 7k How big is your large purchase   1M Thanks for the details It appears that this shortcoming in Solana is already known   Here s hoping they find a way to fix it https   github com solana labs solana issues 12232 This was amazing help  thank you It s the dichotomy of the two  One being superior than the other in nearly every way Man I feel out of the loop  is this like jack sparrow vs the dude or what Moonpay is not supported in NY Because of its scalability  buts its also because pf its upgradeablility and process8ng capacity The ETH on Radium is the SPL wrapped ETH  which is not compatible with regular ETH The ETH there is a SPL wrapped ETH  which means the ETH from coinbase also won t work Because of its scalability  buts its also because pf its upgradeablility and process8ng capacity Solana is solving the problem in the right way  I won t repeat what u aeyakovenko said  I think I will just add another important concept  It s already fast and secure  that s for sure  but is it expensive like Ethereum   I mean  being expensive largely makes a blockchain unscalable and unripe for mainstream adoption  Well  Solana has tied transaction costs to the GPU compute  The premise is that Moore s Law is still progressing  and so chips will keep becoming smaller and of ideal standard as years go by  this means compute costs will continue dropping  as of May 2021  this is proof from IBM s work   https   research ibm com blog 2 nm chip  https   research ibm com blog 2 nm chip   This means that transactions costs will also get cheaper on Solana year after year as such smaller chips get into market  So  my take is that the engineers at Solana really know what they are doing  and Solana will solve it as bandwidth grows over the years with Moore s Law progressing Out of curiosity  what makes you think it will be the winning blockchain my friend Couldn t agree more You can get also get some starter sol on moonpay now to get a sollet wallet seeded with some sol for swapping on serum raydium  You need some sol to power swaps  which is rough if you can t get to an exchange in your state  I m sure there s an elegant solution to do this  but it s one of those things you don t think about unless you can t get in didn t they both die in their first seasons  xD The Solidity compiler generates bytecode   deterministically    That is to say  with the same source code  compiler version and settings  it always produces the exact same contract code that s eventually deployed So to verify a contract  a contract author submits the source code  as well as the compiler version used  and settings of course   Then  a service like Etherscan  or really anyone  will perform the compilation process on their end to see if the produced code matches with what s deployed on the blockchain That s how it works in the Ethereum world  The magic ingredient here is the deterministic bytecode generation  which I find missing in the Solana compiler toolchain hlo sir i sell my tokens pf serum dex but it show eroor in order placing why I d be curious to know how ethereum works in this manner   I don t doubt that they do it  I just can t think of a way to do this off hand that doesn t come back to some kind of trust   But maybe they have a clever solution   I ll have to go look it up Do an on chain transaction on Solana  you ll miss it if you blink  then wait the super slow 20 minutes to get more of another coin over to get more Solana   A dollar on solana goes a looooong way when your using something like serum or raydium  i need 100s of dollars right now in eth gas prices to do something similar and have to wait forever  and god save me if I didn t bid enough gas for the transaction  Solana rocks because it nearly disappears when doing transactions goatse  im a heavy set man in his mid 30s  that won t work on me buddy Just 38  of Sol released  That bad You look like Limmy Have you ever done online banking or shopping  Browser is very safe with proper safety measures They re no different from a lottery  and more transparent Raydium io or FTX US two aspects are necassary for adoption ease of use and cost per transaction if you apply those stipulations to etherium or solanus you may see the simple genius of the of Cardano Me too   I hold over 3 months already   keep long over year Wait   I thought they were here for the discounts I offer on my dancers Solana Discord is your best place for that  It s already crowded for the Solana Season Hackathon  solanaszn  you may have some friends there  hire some later on     It s the heaven for Solana Devs right now     Solana Discord    https   discord com invite pquxPsq Let s not be too hard on the prototype   they proved it works  And Solana may be the next big player to be outrun by a new competitor eventually I m just afraid to move my money to solflare because it s definitely not a finished product and the ledger link up works only occasionally  Exodus is easy and works great imo Yes it may have been a smart investment back then  because a lot was unclear  I guess I wanted to invest  but I never invested in anything before so I never came to do it  And now that the price is this absurd all I would buy is bitcoin short tokens In my eyes  most of investors have no clue about software  programming  the technology behind it all  And they buy what people talk about  what sounds nice  what worked in the past  And that is why bitcoin kept going up  Because most investors just knew blockchain was going to be a big thing and they thought bitcoin is the best bet because it went well before  That was their entire rationale  A lot of money moved into bitcoin just because of that  Nobody knew what Proof of Work actually entails  what 3 tx s entails  what Ethereum meant  I mean why is ethereum not higher valued than Bitcoin  while it is literally better in every aspect  Because people don t realize and they probably don t want to realize  But at some point they must  At some point reality arrives and there will be projects actually solving real problems and they will not be Bitcoin  Sure Bitcoin did the start  and set a huge milestone  but it s a prototype  a proof of concept  not the next platform all DeFi will run on  And literally any secure blockchain can be a store of value  there is nothing special about Bitcoin except for the irrational hype the uninformed mass creates around it I like it too Can you please give me the best DeFi to earn passive on my SOL Which exchange can I sell it on if I m in NY Sell it to usdc or ray and then use that to buy SOL Any idea on how to swap wrapped eth for sol on sollet  I somehow incorrectly transferred my eth from metamask to sollet and it converted to wrapped eth I mean  I don t know  A little tounge in cheek banter is good for everyone  I would expect them to do the same Thanks for the reply  but ro clarify it a bit I m not looking for a decompiler  I m just looking for a way to verify the deployed code is compiled from the source they claim to be  which is exactly how Ethereum works Basically we re missing a way to deterministically compile contracts like we do in Ethereum Thanks will definitely take a look To clarify I m not looking for a decompiler  I m just looking for a way to verify the deployed code is compiled from the source they claim to be  which is exactly how Ethereum works Thanks for the reply  however  gt  everyone will also be able to generate the same fileSadly  this is the part where it s not true  due to the fact that the Solana compiler tool chain doesn t generate deterministic builds  AFAIK   It s different from Ethereum s Solidity compiler  and is making contract verification like that of Etherscan very difficult if not impossible currently  gt  Do your researches about teams  about team leaders  about development  about timelines  about everythingI get it  But at the end of the day it s the contract  program  code that matters  Trusting the team after research is still trust  and that s bugging me Of course Solana is superior to anything that s out there now  I don t know how fast polkadot will be   we will have to see  but Solana is my favorite right now Somebody just send the man SOL so he can make a transaction I bought on ftx us in NY though usdc sent from coinbase  Didnt give location  Lets see if they let me withdraw I guess with Cardano it s like how Seth McFarlane says  it insists upon itself  with the names and the granola  feel  and attaching themselves to Africa and still not even beating an arguably bastard coin like TRON  and no I m not pro Tron it s too shaky The tribalism in crypto is so odd  Why can t Cardano be successful as well I laughed one does not  invest  in solana  one dabbles in the coin unchadlike  until one day you re irresponsibly long with no hesitation  amp  no surrender after spending  400 worth of ETH to deposit some cash into Aave for a measly 2  interest What is it   What is the use case Here s the thing   you might think OP is dumb to want a desktop wallet  in addition to instead of the browser mobile wallets out there  But other people will be thinking like OP as well  and Solana should be catering to them and all other non trivial constituencies if it wants to grow I did but the downvote bots always completely kill the posts I make gt working on an AMM aggregator routerIf you re going to trash people s life projects and livelihoods  you should really back up what you re asserting Join the discord for Cope and you ll get all the answers What is Cope and what is the use case  It sounds like a stake based ponzi scheme I m not making fun or anything  asking seriously  Even the web page says nothing about what it is  it s more like  buy  stake  profit Write in answer  Affordable and fast DeFi transactions I hope so  that would be fantastic Can you also post this video on r CryptoCurrency FTX probably going to see this and build one this weekend Was a great buying opportunity  I got more SOL  RAY  SRM  COPE  and SAMO What is Solana  It s what all the ADA Cardano dudes think ADA is going to be like in 5 years  But it s now  Best kept  secret  in cyrpto right now because of how well positioned it is to draw in institutional players Great project  this is a very good project and has great potential  I hope it develops  I love it    CHEEMSGANG  memecoin  solana It s had a big run up quite recently  Most cryptos are trading sideways most of the time  people complained not so long ago that Ethereum was doing nothing while other coins mooned  Cardano has been doing nothing for months but is starting to move etc I like Sol a lot but I missed the previous run so was aware that it would likely need to consolidate and begin accumulation before moving again  so I still haven t bought in JUST USE PHANTOM If you look at the chart  I am pretty sure it was about to break out of that range on Wednesday right before the ELON BTC fud went down  Obviously everything is still dependent on BTC price action unfortunately  I think if the wider market can hold strong it will happen within the next week   And I seriously think a breakout of this range on volume  pushes us all the way above  75 I can provide a copy of the script but it won t be identical to what I say in the video  the information is the same but when I m reading the scripts I end up rewording sections to make them sound more natural when spoken Can I get a transcript Sollet io Just curious if you have any clue as to when this train is taking off  It s been weird watching it hang around the same price for three weeks as others have mooned Thanks  It s definitely an extremely accomplished chain from a technology standpoint Me too  wondering the same thing Regarding the APY see their emission schedule https   stepfinance medium com step tokenomics 83825705cd8 gt  That s it s  I don t even see the purpose of the token so far Not going to defend them  but obviously if you don t see it you haven t read their whitepaper on tokenomics  https   docs step finance the step token step tokenomics  Whether they will be able to deliver on this remains to be seen  but keep in mind they have prominent VC funding  see logos on step finance   Given the reputational risk  it would surprise me if they would just let this investment go down to 0 Excellent description and a bright future indeed  All in Shit coins on Solana   much innovation  much wow can someone give me a quick answerim using sollet  is there any way to export the private key Thank you  yes  i m looking into liquidity pools and impermanent loss right now  I don t want to jump in unless I know what i m jumping in to You don t need to swap SOL for cope specifically  Go to the trade tab  trade usdc for cope  Keep some USDC because you will need equal parts USDC and Cope to deposit in the liquidity pool  which will give you a pool token  take that over to the fusion tab  Prior to all this make sure you understand impermanent loss at least somewhat  IE if you think COPE will go up a ton in a relatively short period of time farming it may not be your best option  Its only your best option to the extent that your farming rewards more than offset impermanent loss its sort of a buzz word  basically a decentralized network is a super computer  Bitcoin supercomputer was designed to just be a secure trustless financial ledger Ethereum thought if its basically a computer we should be able to do more  so invented smart contracts others followed suit to use it as if its a super computer  EOS WAX being best examples since what you stake gives you more share of the computing power I looked into ICP briefly  but I feel its not much different to the EOS WAX premise of sharing a portion of the blockchain computation power for actions  basically PoS rather than PoW  but PoW will still be required  it will be much less requirements  so could be done on most devices  so can technically be used to make a labor reward system like alien worlds on WAX Everyone needs to stop sucking on Elon s Dick already you should use the reply button to reply to comments You can stake Ray also gt sure hope soSir I said this is an express train  Pls go to your cabin and fasten your seatbelt One project has spent 5 years scientifically validating everything in order to acheive true world changing adoption  has 73  of the entire network staked  has nearly 3 000 staking pools  has native assets that inherit all of the capabilities of ADA itself without smart contracts  is making partnerships with governments  has a  700M treasurey being used by the largest DAO in the world    and who  will have far more advanced smart contracts on the testnet in two weeks Stop reading into the FUD  There is a reason ADA continues to rise and is on it s way to the  3 project   Open your brain https   froglana com Thanks for the feedback Sollet is offering that already  Wormhole bridge   you ll need Metamask along with it though Step 1  Imgur    step2  Imgur    Then your Metamask should pop asking you to confirm the transaction  Remember that the ETH Gas Fees are high  are you sure it s worth it Does anyone know if there s a way to get into the Solana ecosystem without first buying  SOL on a centralized exchange   There aren t any exchanges available where I live that carries SOL pairs I found Wormhole that allows ETH and ERC 20 tokens to be bridged over to use there  but I m not finding a functioning dapp for it anywhere  Only the github repo where it seems like I d need to compile the code and I wouldn t even know where to begin with that I ll do it on a cheap gwei day Thanks that s all I needed I ve never done it before  but learned from youtube idk about that  I sure hope so  bought a lot of sol  It rose really quickly really fast  I think the timeline is more contingent on how soon all these ecosystem projects go live and work out all the bugs  Once the nft auction burnt finance goes live i think it will have a nice rally  We also need to spread the word about Solana  each and every one of us  I bought a Solana t shirt that I wear around and never wash  Just doing my duty Thanks very much man I will give it a shot  trying to understand a lot of this stuff  any resources you have is greatly appreciated Amazing review of the tech  Never seen it presented in such a digestible form  Great video first you have to swap some sol for cope  Then you probably have to go to liquidity tab and get a liquidity token and then yuou can do the fusion farming Spread the helpful info with others in the community   SOL and the ecosystem to another galaxy brother Absolutely  I am bringing my COPE  ROPE  SERUM and new FROGS with me  Thank you My pleasure bro See you on

Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns Why did it bomb recently I not think a Browser is safe  Before i would even think about Defi  i want a safe place for my holdings YES  All good thank you  Didn t settle the transaction on the DEX  Thank you all Which Nano version did you order  Is the Nano X working with SOL staking or am I better off getting the S Congratz mate on making one of the richest people of the world richer and letting him stab you in the back afterwards So that means it may be in the wallet minted on the DEX See if there s a  settle  button  It will transfer the tokens from your minted DEX address to your wallet I think you missed my point  Liquidity on Solana is coming from Serum DEX  Every DeFi protocol s liquidity is in one place  Serum  That s what I found out through my research  Please correct me if I m wrong Look up impermanent loss  That s the risk u have to consider when farming ORCA does this i believe Yeah  I think we do   Even with just three different AMMs  a router would be beneficial to provide the best price on swaps   Even a router on a single AMM would be beneficial  for finding the best route for tokens that don t appear in many different pools   Not to mention  it s a lot more convenient than having to perform two or more swaps and having to do math to make sure you swap the right amounts   Math sucks Hmm makes sense Why don t you use browser wallets  You will be needing them for DeFi  well if you are planning for using dapps Sorry but I m not a fan of step finance Of course more dapps are coming  Many of favourite DeFi protocols are coming to Solana Well I was trying to answer whether we need a router or not Raydium is a separate AMM that runs on top of Serum  and Orca is another AMM   If you look at  https   test step finance   charts  https   test step finance   charts  you can see the different pools on all three platforms The same thing that happened on ETH  BSC  Polygon  and other L2 chains will happen on Solana   There will be more AMMs launching on Solana as time goes on different but maybe some bridge exist but you need more research first You may to do that through Sollet wallet Step 1   Imgur  https   imgur com QFETdWi Step   Imgur  https   imgur com a7mHCAW Then your Metamask should pop asking you to confirm the transaction  Remember that the ETH Gas Fees are high  are you sure it s worth it  If you face any problem  amp  your transaction didn t reach your USDC SPL address in Sollet  contact Serum Support in    Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6  or    Telegram    https   t me ProjectSerum Yes  I have SOL in Wallet  I can see that my transaction was successful on Solana explorer The Frog token appears in my Wallet after doing the transaction but with a zero balance  Did not mint the Frog token to wallet before doing the transaction Yes  OXY will get the profit form the protocol via staking  but they are still in alpha  So guess it will take a little bit more time Do u have sol in ur wallet  It cost  0005 sol to mint token address Using my iPad  so I guess I am using Safari f you re using GoogleChome  try with another browser  I personally faced that problem  with another token add   amp  used FireFox  amp  went smooth Tried  but getting a error message when trying to add token manually Click on that           symbol  amp  choose     MANUAL INPUT      enter the Frog token details then click     ADD      No idea if this will help show your Frog token though  just a try won t hurt  amp  won t cost you too much 50 first dates I think What makes you say that Used Sollet io Wallet Can you create a Sollet wallet on a mobile device or does it have to be on a desktop its not 4 you  so chill Are you using sollet wallet  If yes you should ve minted the frog token there  Don t know if minting it right now will help you show the token in your sollet  but totally worth it  It will cost you 0 00204 SOL I love Solana it s my favorite but Yeah it s a problem getting it in New York   limited adoption in New York because of this  I m going to try SOR Network No Did you mint the Frog token into your wallet first Bought some Frogs connecting SOL wallet to Solape  transaction went fine  Now  my balance of Frogs in Wallet still shows zero Frogs  Can someone advise please Don t buy on leverage bro  you ll get liquidated on next dip and bring SOL price down with you No  with Raydium you can only swap on existing Raydium liquidity pools   Try to swap SOL for OXY for instance  and it will tell you there isn t sufficient liquidity  because there s no pool    A router would find the most efficient way to get from SOL to OXY using the liquidity pools that do exist  for example SOL   gt  RAY   gt  OXY  Also  with Raydium you re only swapping on Raydium pools   The Raydium Dapp will not route orders through other AMMs   For instance  if Orca  another AMM on Solana  will give you a better swap rate on SOL USDC  the Raydium Dapp will not route your swap through Orca   You re only going to get the swap rate from the Raydium SOL USDC pool Solanium itself isn t a scam  But there are a bunch of scams pretending to be Solanium Yes but that not a solution  in my eyes  A crypto currency without an own desktop wallet  I can t generate multiple adresses with exodus  Can i do this with Solana anyway Post this to the Step Finance discord  They are all active and responsive there You can have custom addresses per user  Memos are a really bad idea as it s easy to loose funds Isn t Raydium doing that currently Is it  SAKITA  They airdropped tokens to users who help COPE  amp  SOL https   www unlimitedcope comhttps   ropesolana com Getting this today Yes Well in a decentralized crypto world  regulation is as evil as a ponzi scheme  By some regarded as the same at least in the financial world  So not sure what will happen  Exciting times Your post has been

subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns You can use Exodus Awesome  Totally makes sense  Thanks Sandy  Still wrapping my head around this space Yes providing liquidity carries this exact risk  if you leave it on for long enough make sure the rewards cover what you stand to lose COPE has picked up recently as quite the community  Basically if you hold at least X cope either in your wallet or staking or some combination  you might get airdrops This the reason why regulations have to come in to protect the vulnerables  Common sense is not that common after all  That s why people gotten scammed Can you imagine if someone loses a lot of money in these meme coins Step 1   Imgur  https   imgur com QFETdWi step2   Imgur  https   imgur com a7mHCAW Then your Metamask should pop asking you to confirm the transaction  Remember that the ETH Gas Fees are high  are you sure it s worth it You may use FTX SRM to Sollet  much easier Done https   twitter com hadrian37 status 1392949898258128896 s 19 Agree  I guess it s the responsibility of the ecosystem to self govern and eliminate fraud  But given that people only interested in where they can find the next meme coins tells you all about where we are today  I hope this will change Maybe airdrop  But I already searching where or what token it may be  I can t find it Make sure to have 0 1 SOL in your wallet  amp  try these solutions  1   un link  link your wallet again   refresh Raydium  amp  try again 2   Use another browser 3   Reduce the size your swapping  amp  try small amounts Is anyone forcing you or others to buy in  People need to learn to do their own research  If you buy something with no fundamentals you are gambling with your own money at your own risk  That s your responsibility True They fund these projects  imagine if SOL was as big as DOGE Sakita This is a full noob question  but what are the risks associated with connecting a hot wallet to be whitelisted Is it typically recommended to use a burner Thanks 100  agree this is needed and will be a big improvement  Hopefully the team at STEP are up to the task This is one feature that would definitely get me to use their platform  often So operating a ponzi scheme where people will lose a ton of money is acceptable to society I m in NY and we don t have access to ftx us binance us etc Where do you stay   They do have ftx us by the way   It sucks but works Solanium is a Launchpad built on Solana  same as many other built on Solana I see  so this project isnt actually associated with Solana then Cheems is by far the project with the best potential recently in the Solana ecosystem If you want to ban people from doing things then permissionless blockchains like Solana and Ethereum are not for you and never will be  You re missing like half the point i have tried several times and i cannot swap ray to sol today does  https   raydium io   https   raydium io   work properly for everybody Cumrocket made me laugh hahaha  At least it works for that
2021-05-15,42.69994585,45.39178963,39.3746057,Thanks  Only problem is that it looks like I can t actually add an ERC 20 without having a little SOL to pay for it  It s an issue I m running into across all the bridges  Got  50 in anyETH stuck on BSC because I don t have any BNB to pay to swap or move it SBF is going to kill himself with such a lifestyle US  blockfolio The question is  Is what I said truthful Truth has no subjection in it  It s either yes  or no  I must down voted you fake display of virtue signaling that dude fucks Wait  you were hoping for a witty reply in response to your tactless  meme I m in the US and have a node    US residents are not able to receive rewards from the foundation but Solana is open and permission less I was hoing for a witty response  You know something fun   A poke at the meme   All I get is a used up hackneyed political jabOr was my remarks to close to home  Let me assure you it smelled nice  just so you know This is the way Edited  check

did well for me  but I didn t withdrawal yet I think in most cases  FTX is the way to go Make sure to rotate some of that into the network s very first memecoin   Samoyedcoin  SAMO  Named after Sam Bankman Fried  the gigabrain behind most of the Solana based projects and CEO of FTX  The projects main goal is bringing awareness to the ecosystem through memes  5  of the supply will be burned soon leading into the 3 week long Solana hackathon event  Half of the supply will also be burned in July to kickstart Solana Summer  There are plans in the roadmap for NFTs and a trading card game for Q3 4 Some interesting bits SBF follows the coin s Twitter account  In his recent interview on Ethereal 2021  there s a tissue box in perfect view behind his chair of what looks to be a white animal  could be a polar bear to be fair   Also  why wouldn t SBF support a meme from his own ecosystem  He understands the power of memes based on his recent thread about Elon s actions regarding Dogecoin  I have a feeling this is another gigabrain move and thinking ahead on Sam s part  Imagine buying Dogecoin when it first came out  except instead of getting shit on  the market now actually places value on your memeability  Imagine what a major listing like FTX or supportive tweets by SBF could do to the demand   and price  Right now it s only available on DEXs which are  too hard  for most people

red flag for SOL to me is that US citizens cant setup validator nodes for whatever reason  Outside that  SOL is poised to win this race despite being in 17th place on the last turn  It s consolidated for quite some time  stayed strong while other cryptos have fallen from the FUD  SOL is a sleeper  but its easily north of  100 SOL by the summer SOLstice The drop in the token price is a supply demand issue   The fusion pool is minting a lot of new coins  and there isn t enough demand to keep the price propped up Bump  I am also looking for info I am a freelance dev  but only recently discovered solana  It looks very promising  so will definitely start investing some time in starting to learn its ecosystem Ooof  this is a major flaw I was unaware of Thanks Yeah I did notice a lot of the articles I read when researching for this video either had various steps out of sequence or just completely missed vital info  but I try to make sure my videos always cover everything a potential investor should know on a fundamental level What you say is true  and I hold quite a few tokens in the Solana space  But I still miss something like PCS 1inch  Was lurking around Fantom lately  but they already have it available  OXY could be it  but not sure it will ever finish wondering  i was      Boinevertaken      Commands   opt out    delete i was wondering Nailed it mate  What a lot of videos and write ups miss when explaining Solana to a layperson is the sequential steps from when a user submits a transaction and how it gets added onto the blockchain You probably didn t know what you were doing  stop complaining about a loss and stop trashing people s work Very nice job Try simple things like 1   Disconnect  amp  Connect your wallet again to Serum  2   Refresh the Serum tab  try again 3   Use another browser  it helps sometimes  Simple things like that can be so much helpful  personal experience Same thing  I like Doge but the future is IOTA and SOL  And for whatever reason still own BTT Every week i am thinking to sell all my BTT cos i see it has no future but still holding for no reason It s only related in that a large supply   lower price   noobies think it has a better chance of going from  0001 to  1 than 100 to 10000  So it s actually a good thing to have a large supply Weekly Summary   May 7   May 14 2021       SOL Market   Value Around   11

accepting Bitcoin the official Solana Twitter account was in the comments basically said   my dms are open  With thousands of likes  I don t know the answer but I have messaged my validator node asking for an estimate on kilowatthour and will circle back with a number if they give it to me I m sure that s not the argument  I haven t watched this video  but I ve heard both sides of this debate ample times  Bitcoin s use of energy is what makes the most secure network in the world and completely decentralized   unlike any other blockchain out there  Listen  I m not saying proof of stake has no place  Clearly  I think Solana is pretty amazing  But to secure the   world s monetary system    it needs to be secure  and using energy to do that is not a waste  Many people are asking the wrong questions  I m very much an advocate of environmentalism but just as much as bitcoin and that s not a contradiction  The fiat system uses  far  more energy than bitcoin  not to mention the bombs dropped on countries to prove the USD dominance  and we don t even get sound money  The internet uses about 10  of the world s energy  and most of that is used for porn and pointless nonsense  Do we shut the internet down  No  Advanced civilizations require energy  and bitcoin is a good use of energy  I really urge people to think beyond the  bitcoin uses lots of energy therefore it s bad

the way  if it s that  most energy used mining bitcoin is renewable   it doesn t matter  I ve read that 80  of bitcoin energy use is renewable  but even so the 20  remaining is egregiously bad  and the argument remains the same Sure  anything so that I don t have to sit through a YouTube video   Thanks Amazing piece of information  Dive deeper into the tech and keep making such videos Burnt Finance is a project for minting NFTs on Solana as I understand it  you can look it up on Twitter and from what I ve absorbed it s going to be auction style like opensea or rarible like ones on Ethereum What is the nft auction burnt finance Michael Saylor makes the best argument against this environmentalist FUD  https   www youtube com watch v TeVvtSCfcQ4 In Solana podcast they mentioned 1 1000 of bitcoin  but it probably was just an estimate gt  When will there be a desktop wallet available There is an official desktop Solana wallet for those who are not afraid of using command line tools  https   docs solana com cli usage SOL will fly    I m it s what so many of us have been waiting for for years If you mentioned step finance doing it  then why is step finance price being dumped like crazy I hope so  although on weekends coins typically don t rally on on Monday Yellen  IRS  Musk  SEC  or Biden might say something stupid again Its just getting started    And this isn t some hopefull ignorant proud maximalist statement like so many of these  Ethereum Killers  fans    Just go look for yourself at the amount of projects launching on Solana everyday    Its staggering Solana is the only Ethereum competitor If SOL doesn t hit 500 in 2021  I call FUD Defi  Blockchain social media apps  streaming  dating etc  are all launching on solana    The kind of stuff we ve all been dreaming about for years  Solana makes it possible RIP idc about the now baby   maybe 5 bull runs from now You re sexy af            ️ Easy   It s like setting up a new wallet   Once set up you just transfer your SOL to it and then delegate it to validators SOL GOAT gt  SolFlareHow difficult is it to get your Solana on to Solflare for staking Is SOL environmentally friendly They are working on the ability to run evm apps on solana  They are gonna do uniswap first I think  There is a channel for it in the solana discord  That s probably the best place to get more info Much respect for responding Yeah  I should ve specified that I was aware of Wormhole  it s awesome   I mainly meant EVM compatibility in terms of programs dapp etc being able to be ported over to work in the Solana ecosystem so Ethereum developers can easily migrate over their work without an overhaul in language    There is a ton of amazing things that Solana has over others in the blockchain space  Proof of History as a consensus using VDFs  the booming ecosystem in defi  gaming  NFTs  music  launchpads  etc  The one thing that may be missing  and this one thing may not prove to be all that relevant in the end or now as maybe these are just noob questions  is the EVM compatibility function that helps as a rallying point for other sound projects like Cosmos and Avalanche   I m a longterm believer in Solana and the ecosystem  but am just trying to figure out if there are aspects or dimensions of the project that I am missing in my online research of things Are you sure you didn t just place a limit order and the price didn t hit  Try canceling the open order ya funny how elon sells all his btc before he made that announcement As much as I know  Solana has a bridge that makes migration from ETH to SOL possible and it is called wormhole   Wormhole allows existing projects  platforms  and communities to move tokenized assets seamlessly across blockchains to benefit from Solana s high speed and low cost  https   solana com wormhole I haven t bought anything from the ecosystem yet  waiting to use the phantom wallet  I m happy with just holding and staking SOL at the moment Ik I wish I had some more funds  Like a dumbass I bought it at  13 To the moon I believe SOL will rocket up Some projects under Sol seems quite promising as well  Personally I like KIN Yes he helped a lot and also trolls a lot  amp  had a huge affect on the market  This isn t a good thing  Crypto is meant to be decentralised and shouldn t be controlled by what one human tweets every day  BTC was here long before Elon was relevant or super popular on Twitter etc  There s also many other big names investors celebs sports stars musicians etc who have helped the industry You need about 20 000 40 000 sol to break even you need a beefy computer and internet connection https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs Hong Kong is where FTX offices are It s a good time to buy No expert but I think it s naturally more volatile  Emits a bunch of tokens for rewards and people like to sell the dip lol Ya cuz they r all considered yield farming The chairman of the SEC is one of the most knowledgeable people in crypto  he did a course for MIT and is good friends with the founder of algorand This is the way yeah Would like to know the same gt    How fast are transactions and how may this change over time I personally use it for a while now and the transaction can be Finalized   Confirmed in matter of seconds  2   3 seconds   sometimes even less than that  YEP  Like magic lol  gt    What is the transaction cost and how may this change over time For now it costs 0 000005 SOL according to solanabeach io  which is equal to 0 000211 USD according to Solana price right now   42 Per One Single SOL   gt    From a consumer perspective how is this different from ETH  what does it offer Well  a simple comparison of Speed and Transaction Fees will make ETH look like the evil kind of blockchains lol  Solana is way more Fast and Cheaper compared to Ethereum  For Solana thanks to  Moore Law   it can offer unlimited scalability  gt    Do you have any example products using the tech I can see All dapps in solana right now are good example of that  especially Serum and Raydium and all the other dapps built on Solana I m with you  I m pretty invested in Solana  but the number of people experiencing the same problems over and over for months is frustrating  Raydium is the same  The admin on TG   Please visit trading page and settle funds  about 100x per day The corresponding seed phrase of the wallet you sent the money to  Not the one you sent it from I have my seed phrase  The issue wasn t that Someone correct me if I m wrong  i believe you do not need to create a new token in your wallet  It should auto populate when you purchase said token Hi All  I ve read through this thread and overall what s everyone s thoughts on a safe place to stake SOL  I keep hearing reading different things and want to just park my SOL somewhere and let it ride Bitcoin is bigger than Musk How  Did you had the corresponding seed phrase Oh     thank you For developers  for minting and stuff Pls can u explain further  Thank you No it is sort of testnet Yes  So its scam elon is likely the identified whale  the big bag holder of DOGE  owning 28  percent of all DOGE  its him or robin hood  either way its LAME You re probably on devnet sol com   It s not real airdrop Step finance also has some cool tools for LP pools and values for the tokens I already did  It took me few days to figure it out thoug  Anyone needs help with this please contact me here or on Telegram u ZenSamadhi Trying to send SOL What were you trying to send  What token  It s prob not supported on your Binance  You should keep any solana specific airdrops in your sollet wallet Mercurial is gonna be amazing  Same with oxygen   Maps me  https   Maps me  releasing solana integration will be awesome as well  Serum is already dope No  I didn t send all I copied my sol address in binance and pasted it in the address box in my sollet wallet I tried it number of times  So what can I do about it  I observed I cant send tokens outside the wallet Phantom  Put the fucking wallet out or stfu You transferred across networks different block chains  I think in the sollet wallet you can only send to sol erc20 lol It s probably gone forever Yes he is not  His passion is space travel  But he helped a lot by taking huge  1 5B BTC stake on S amp P 500 listed company   this is super important because other companies will follow and buy the dip and it will be shallower and shorter thanks to that Ofc it s faster  because it s fully centralized   Not the worst thing in the world but it s good to be aware of why ETH is so valuable   All these other chains sacrifice decentralization and or security for speed Thanks His question wasn t why it wasn t ahead of Ethereum  it was why it isn t top 10  And that s a fine question when you consider that it is a working smart contract blockchain  which is undergoing massive growth and outperforms anything else on the planet This is assuming you re talking about your own investment of course Ape board finance my friend 425 by September 29th  Solstrodamus doesn t lie I think as of recently  yes  But I don t have experience with the blockfolio app specifically and I like the FTX ui Staking on exodus is far easier than solflare  However  all staking goes to everstakes node  On solflare  you can choose which is much better for decentralization and Solana in the long run The us gov hates crypto Dude is missing ear plugs and a visor over the eyes  He hasn t ascended into big brain sleep mode IKEA   surprisingly great chairs  I work a fancy job and this is what I have for my WFH rig  fancy as in my mom approves of it So true Elon is not our friend  Remember that I also bought on  FTX us  https   FTX us  and it did well for me Noob question is that the same as blockfolio Staking on Exodus     10 4  APY What a dumb title Hey  I totally get that  These wallets can be frustrating and they certainly could have better educational materials to help people onboard in  I would love to see more of that from the hackathon  I personally use sollet with either Sonar or Ape finance and it works really nice for me to track yields and see balances  I personally haven t had a problem but I know that may folks do which sucks  cause it s fun to play around with the different tools the ecosystem has Nope  I am stating a fact about power  I am pointing out that money cannot recreate missed windows of opportunity The meme above is simply digesting these truths  The truth is that sniffing the cheerleaders snatch can never be purchased because that window has now closed And all the money in the world can never open it again  Simple I don t think you will be able to retrieve them  nobody knows the private key of the public address you sent them to  Binance only knows the private key to the Ethereum address they provided you with  but you didn t actually sent it there  you sent it to some address in Solana    And because it s computationally impossible to reverse engineer it  that s what makes blockchains secure   then there s no way to retrieve them Your post has been automatically removed because your account does

but it won t hurt to contact the right persons Check with    Serum Telegram Support    https   t me ProjectSerum  or their    Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6   which is my advice to go there Great project You re ascribing meaning to losing your virginity in high school  Super tight dude I got this on Twitter from coin98  There s a lot of activity among different dapp developers cause of the hackathon so I ve been cruising around on there You know that pointing overvalued projects doesn t bring value on another one   It s interesting otherwise I would not be there  but not the only interesting one Where do you get infographics like this I understand there are a number of interesting layer 2 solutions out there  I mean look at the valuation of ADA and it doesn t even offer smart contracts  I d argue there are a number of overvalued coins based on promises of future developments  In Solana s defense  they have a working layer 1 infinitely scalable  Proof of history system  that s here and ready now   No sharding required  Hate if you want  I m just here cause I think the tech is really interesting so I invested Thanks for clearing that up  Bad info online That s not correct   You can choose your validator   And SolFlare even gives you visibility to who the top validators are and encourages you to not choose them in order to decentralize I heard SolFlare all uses the same validator  bad for decentralization Well  as others   have you seen that there s not only solana and ethereum   May you should just open your eyes  look what the others projects are doing and you may understand why solana doesn t have a higher valuation atm Have you even used the ecosystem  Raydium is so fast and cheap  Great farming yields on brand new coins with idos coming out often Maybe just cause there s not that much good projects on Solana    Quality  gt  gt  Quantity  There s few interesting ones tho  so just be patient I haven t asked anyone else to calculate anything   I have no idea what you are ranting about I blame the current irrational market  I also think Proof of History can be a little complicated at first  so maybe people just don t get how game changing it will be  Seems to be a lot of smart people trying to build a real use community  I mean I heard about this one project called SolDate which is like a blockchain based dating app in development on Solana  I think the future is bright for making just about anything You can use binance   com or  us by first buying usdt and then buy sol  or ftx and after buying it you can stake it and get profit  Personally I use Exodus for staking and it gives around 10 Raydium is for liquidity farming   I m talking about straight SOL staking   No LP  no IL I m trying to understand how Solana isn t a top 10 crypto right now  I just don t get it Thanks Is this the way Or use raydium https   youtu be pRLpBcea 98 might be helpful This works  Have done it before If you haven t gotten this fixed yet I

thanks   Will read the whitepaper   Where are you staking it Yeah the  View discussions in 74 other communities  shown below the post on the right shows that this person is just spamming it everywhere for each individual coin Yes  it s definitely in the same area as Akami and Cloudflare  It s goal is pretty much to remove that middle man content delivery person that can set terms of use and make platforms block content  It pretty much incentives users to monetize spare bandwidth basically to create a P2P delivery network  And end users can use and interact with the content with no accounts

really good And it s still up 9 Yes  But what I want is a contract that takes SOL WSOL on Solana and spits out a WSOL ERC 20 token on Ethereum  That way I could hold my SOL like I hold my BTC  as a

already dumped   Bitcon looks really really weak Absolute spam  You can t even buy SOL on Coinbase  The guide has nothing to do with SOL  it s just a generic overview of three exchanges that no one even bothered to skim before upvoting  This kind of trash hurts the sub Had Musk not entered into a crusade vs BTC  we would be lingering around 60 right now   Unfortunately I can not comprehend why are SOL or some other alts correlated to BTC  Its not that stocks are correlated to gold   It should be the other way around gt I know this is a weird question but I only have these hints  I need to know which token it is It is a weird question though  tjhis sub reddit is not the right place for this  there is other crypto oriented sub reddits  groups     that might be much helpful with this

They don t seem publicly available and I don t see them on the discord or websites of the tokens When it gets added to coinbase  Rumors are spreading Definitely doesn t lose in security  the PoW used

Mint An SPL Token In Your Sollet Wallet  Screenshots     Imgur  https   imgur com 4ZYs8mS  Imgur  https   imgur com tclfB9O sollet io I didn t hear anything related Solana in this video  What s the purpose of posting it here What wallet are you using Count me in Solana is not an  alternative  to Proof of Stake   It  is  Proof of Stake   It uses Proof of History as a technique to optimize consensus mechanisms for faster operation    Proof of Stake and Proof of History are not mutually exclusive   They are two different techniques that work together delete Simple   If a block is not seen by enough of the network soon enough  it does not get consensus faster than a later block which does achieve consensus   Then the  slow  block gets skipped Everything is tuned and optimized to try to minimize this   It still happens  and it s not terribly infrequent   10    14  or so of blocks are skipped  depending on the epoch and random factors Solana is optimized to include as few  round trips  as possible in communication so it can proceed with the lowest latencies possible But there are still latencies  and they can be worse from one location to another   The protocol is built to tolerate some latency but when latencies are too high  then blocks get skipped   This happens most frequently when one node is  sandwiched  between two other nodes who are closer to each other than they are to the middle node Skipped blocks are a problem and the Solana devs are constantly working to tune the software to make them less common   They are a problem because they introduce latency   a transaction has a 10    14  chance of getting the additional half second minimum latency that comes from being on a skipped block and having to go into a later block Solana Summer inc Crypto com

literature on solana s website Thanks dude No it was a bunch of docs  but I ll check this out too  Thanks There is WSOL in Solana just like there s WETH on Ethereum  that way you can just use a single interface to interact with all tokens  The reason I ask is because I like to keep all my cryptoholdings in a single non custodial wallet  Ether  WBTC  etc   I have a few scattered here and there at exchanges  but Solana is the only one that represents a decent chunk stucked on exchanges  And I can t consolidate them all on Solana yet because the ecosystem is still too immature for that  maybe in the future  Maybe I should look into creating a WSOL on Ethereum  Presumably it shouldn t be that big of a deal using wormhole Do you mean this one  https   www youtube com watch v qNIhClYDjR8 There

protocol they built which breaks the packets down into smaller sizes to keep the bandwidth low  And then also the Gulf Stream protocol which allows validators to execute transactions ahead of time and reduce the amount of confirmation time as well  its basically removes the need for mempools Honestly there is some crazy things happening under the hood here I love this answer I prefer you don t

Most people are not qualified to run a Solana validator   Sorry but it is true   It is a high performance network that requires expertise to run and validators are actively adding value by making nodes run better and better through their expertise That may change to some degree in the future  but for now  it s the way things are Buy the dip Stop But IP loss is just loss of potential gains  It s like selling too early and the coin goes up after that I don t know why people call this a risk  you still made money if the token goes up  just not as much of you just held it At least you didn t lose principal All transactions go to one node for a period of time   The scale of the network depends on each node s capabilities   Additionally  there is a far higher chance of failure   It s not truly distributed at the time of processing   It also invites Byzantine actors I also saw it hit 52  on Binance  but coingecko shows only 51 64 Don t forget to COPE well u are probably younger Also you should research the sol ecosystem and spread out some money in the SPL tokens Recommendations would be cope ray bonfida u remindme 1 month How much Solana does it take to stake  Liked what I read yesterday which lead me here  but  it s not available on cypto com  like 3 others I loved aren t either lol   But I have Exodus  so I m thinking of getting another exchange in order to get in the car I m happy to receive 1 SOL if that doesn t happen  Happy to have my wallet of SOL if it does 1400    feels poor now NFA but if I was in your shoes I d sell the Ada and convert it to Sol  Both just recently hit ATH s  One of the two has working smart contracts  One of the two has been saying they will have smart contracts for the past 5 years Sup bro I m from NY aswell  When starting on Solana I would connect metamask with sollet and transfer eth into Sol directly from sollet wallet recieve sol tab  Max is 0 1 eth and alot of it gets eaten up with gas fees  I recommend using stealthex io for limitless swaps with no kyc or logging required  they support a bunch of coins that you can swap directly to Solana with much lower fees  The last option is to get a vpn  if you do you can sign up to ftx  This route will have the lowest slippage feesNFA Seriously  people are not realizing crypto will be an evolving ecosystem for the longest time and there will be better solutions coming every few years  It is software after all Lol agree RemindMe 1 month I need more SOL Remindme 1 month We are not brainless doge army It is a working smart contract block chain that is experiencing huge growth and far outperforms every one of it s peers  You have coins like ADA that literally have no use cases other than buy  sell and stake that are sitting at a  70 bil market cap  Eventually the rest of the crypto world will catch up and you ll be regretting even considering this as an option  Of course DYOR 99  ain t 100  bet XD don t gamble I haven t done my research but it bothers me how secure proof of history actually is It s the best time of year  To buy more sol What s is your reasoning for that conclusion on Ada  Genuine question Taken profit is the way for good monnaie management i buy at 10dollars and i don t regret to sell 25  at 40dollars ez Sell 25  now  25  at 75dollars  all at 100dollars if you live in the us  you need a vpn so you can buy from a normal website Who s everyone 16 400 users times  50    820 000 52 6 on Binance  Don t let it drop  HODL THE LINE PUMP IT I m all in with 1400 coins all staked Gotcha   And yes Solana has a deflationary issuance schedulehttps   docs solana com inflation inflation_scheduleOur federal government is gonna recognize much more than 5 Thought this could help any beginner s interested in Solana  appreciate anybody checking it out What wallet do you use for RAY This guy fucks I gotcha  I thought you were referring to manually selecting which validator you wanna stake with  which if you use solflare  which is the standard way to stake  you do By 5  inflation you mean Solana   Or just the pure irresponsibility of our federal govt Remindme  1 month No  not a question  You literally have to press the button that says  Stake SOL   unlike ADA where you just have to deposit into the staking wallet This brake failure is fake news  Tesla had  19B in cash when they bought BTC  Chinese government gave them tax exemption  NIO got much bigger one What are the disadvantages of leader based Byzantine consensus design Using Moonlet   You can link Ledger Nano to your account   11 62  APY staking currently Is that a question  cuz you don t have to  They partnered with Everstake  so it gets staked with them  Also  they auto compounds rewards which is nice Saw a lot of questions about the chain  so I wanted to share this resource from their YouTube channel that helps explain the Proof of History system that Solana uses Either I double my money on SOL  or I get one free SOL from this person on Reddit  Win win when in doubt  remember that Solana has a currently functioning layer one ecosystem  Ada doesn t even have smart contracts  Eth is in the process of upgrading to a proof of stake system that needs shards   Meanwhile Solana runs a Proof of History and Proof of Stake system already and will never need that network upgrade  It will easily be a top 5 in the coming years due to utility alone Let s goooooo Will be at  100 in less than a month   If not I ll give everyone 1 sol Another reason to stake is because we ll see 5   inflation this year  so by not staking you are literally burning value out of your wallet also remember that the Ray Sol farm pays rewards in Ray only  And that as the LP pool TVL changes  the sol ray ratio is slightly adjusted  The fees should come from rewards You have to manually enter it into the stake pool on Exodus The one I always thought about joining but never did hahah Ah unreal   I don t stand mine but have read for other coins that take up to 2 weeks  I may look into staking then I also think more people should know about the media foundations work on The Media Network  its a open source streaming platform cdn provider  As a video guy  I think it could be big one day Add and hodl but try to get the dips naturally  sol is a solid coin Makes sense   definitely can see has the hackathon launch could be a catalyst for some people to load up on crypto  But clearly sentiments are kicking  Saw a really good article on TechCrunch yesterday  that s bound to help out However  if you were to pump a coin    Sunday before people in the US get in when there is virtually no liquidity would be the time I would do it Is it staking if mine is on exodus  They say 10  apy it s me this time and last time tooo Great timing So sorry for the idiot question but how would one end up getting the APY  Is it the same across all ecosystems Binance my dude It loses in security  but the question is whether that s significant or not what s Summer SOLstice   Any info please So say I had a bunch of sol on there I wouldn t even be able to transfer to a different sol wallet without kyc The Maps thing  I think Sam Bankman Fried  big Solana supporter  just invested into an existing popular non crypto app   Maps me  https   Maps me   as a way to Trojan horse crypto and defi into the pockets of lots of normies by integrating a crypto wallet into it Anyway Raydium seems like the best put together Solana offering currently  Step finance  https   Step finance  has also retraced a lot  so it could be a good buy  or alternatively it might have just been massively overvalued before Yeah  a bit odd  I also note that this happened literally right before the start of the summer hackathon  https   twitter com solana status 1393934759475093507Of course you could say that that s the reason for the rise  but it s weird  Almost seems like a calculated buy move in order to suddenly put Solana at the top of the crypto news cycle  Since there are billionaires like Bankman Fried supporting the ecosystem it s not that difficult to guess that this could be an artificial pump I was waiting for an entry in the next week and then seeing it suddenly drive up like this is annoying  Even more so if it s a genuine pump and it just starts to move off like Cardano recently has with no further retracements Congraaats I will hodl and add 1 Sol each  dip   Ty Good words  Thank you Anyone know why It s beautiful  but I am always worried when something goes up on a Sunday where there is usually extremely low amount of liquidity   meaning expect people to come in and sell on the Monday Not that I care  it s all staked and the passcodes have been hidden away so I won t be selling  But still  I care because when preaching the gospel of Solana I need to be able to pitch to people the right entry points Something  explosive  is about to happen  I don t know a rocket might take off from the Solana platform Chose the right     derivative path     that contains your address a amp  click on     Restore      That should do it  If that didn t fix the problem  you should head to    Serum Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6    Sollet section  they ll help you out  You can always try their    Telegram Support Group    https   t me ProjectSerum  too HODL  If everything turns out like planned  SOL will be  gt 1000 somewhere between 2025 2030  Sure it s just an guess  but what are 130    Your risk is minimal  but the opportunity is huge  You will hate yourself if you sell now and don t wait longterm Exchange recommendations on where to buy Solana   The three I use do not have Solana Just bought Solana for first time at  49  in for the ride I was listening to Van Halen 5150 when it hit  51 50 while drinking my morning coffee  EUPHORICFix sollet pls I m SOLtbae I ve been telling people breaking out of that range we are in around 50 will take us to above 75 relatively quick  When this thing moves it moves  Beyond that it is all dependent on the wider market not tanking  But if it can hold up there is no reason SOL shouldn t have a bigger market cap then Cardano  That takes the price above  250  I live in world where the conversation will eventually be BTC ETH  and SOL  And in some circles of people I greatly respect it already is Prepare to have a mind melt when you start researching this tech  It s pretty detailed and complicated to grasp imo compared to a bunch of the other blockchains  There is a video posted on this Reddit about a day ago that goes through all of the tech  Try and give it a watch when you get time  very informative This feels huge right now but in a year we re going to laugh at getting excited about  50 That s it right  There s so many promissing projects out there  hard to stand out unless you really know how all the fundamentals work in detail  I don t understand half of the technicals about blockchain  nodes  etc etc  I m not a tech guy Hope everyone boarded the train  We have reached the express portion of our journey  Next stop is 76 This is a comment I like  Optimism but also realism  I m very sensitive to good logo s  and Solana s logo is very nice I m very bullish on this 4th generation blockchain  No BS  but keep in mind I m not a financial advisor  Do your research brother  It s a very promising project with a lot of momentum at the moment  but things can change minute to minute Hey guys   why is solana  pumping now Sell some at  200 and some at  400 but hold on to some Best TA indicators are imo Bollinger Bands  change def parameters to 18 and 1 5 RSI  change default parameters to 6  and upper   lower bands to 85 and 15 On balance volume  def parameters are sufficient Volume changes over moving avg volume   price action  RSI and Bollinger bands will help you guide entry and exit points  The more capital you have  the less   swings you have to make   1000 swung on 5  every 15 mins ad a crypto coin bounces its way upward is a lot of money compounded over a few hours  Knowing when to exit is easy with bollinger bands and always monitoring on balance volume All of the above indicators  their equations  or just simply application are at your disposal on Google  Key is volume  volatility is a traders best friend  That is it in brief  Ahhh one more actually  with the above  always cycle different time windows  e g   1 min  3 min  5 min  15 min  30 min  1hr  4hr   This helps knowing if you re jumping in the middle beginning or end of a bull run     rantSome people go wild with 10  indicators  but the key is really just trading on high volume  price action  during a bull run of sorts  If you only have  100 200  larger swings are necessary to make money  So the game is more difficult I feel   1000 is probably what you need to step up to the table  Use limit sell and buy orders  Know your   roi targets before going in  It s trial and error   and a whole lot of not blinking for a couple hours as you stare at the charts lol Is the sentiment in this sub  to the moon   Or are people realistic here  I like both kinds of subs  but lean towards the lather Boom  Let s roll Adddddddd How did you even learn how to short trade efficiently  I tried with a low budget from my portfolio many times and I keep losing money  Would love to learn more because I enjoy trading so much When SOLtrain Hey  u GenderNeutralBotI want to let

a long term holder and staker but the tokenomics aren t great   huge uncirculated supply Thank you for the heads up Be careful with gate io  they will require kyc verification to withdraw anything from their platform  Basically if you don t have an address in another country your crypto will be locked on their platform No  it takes 1 Epoch  3 days at most Nothing like wanting everything done and ha ded to you It depends where you stake it but you can t sell it immediately if you wanted  Have to put in a request which can take 2 weeks thinking that environmentals don t matter is just a form of shortsighted tunnel vision                                                                                                                 bitcoin can never take over any form of currency   expensive in every manner that counts  will be kept in rich guys vaults making it impossible to use as global currency  ethereum  requires  GAS  making it inefficient and costly  This makes it unlikely candidate   Cardano  A good choice and very bankable  wide distribution excellent back end and ticks all the important boxes also has timestamping   XRP ripple  an excellent choice for global currency  Uses less energy than nearly any other crypto   good wide distro  dogecoin  maybe the best choice as it is old enough with excellent branding  already widely distributed and has utility wider than any other crypto and has depreciation built in    Solana another excellent choice  great dev team  uses mostly solar energy and has a popular eco system  ticking most of the boxes  amp  x200B   but at the end of the day dogecoin comes away with prize for widest use  that will cripple any chance it has of exceeding  5US I think it would struggle to get to  2 50 but will become global currency so market cap won t matter  doge will be great to take on holidays overseas  or paying for your dogs grooming or dare I say it paying for shit you bought on Amazon    that leaves Cardano  Ripple and Solano to fight out between them who will be the Reasonably priced crypto to buy cars and boats with  And that s where  CEO s of theis coins should be making their pitch   That way they are looking after the investors best interests allowing organic growth  I have all the affermention coins and a few others  No I don t have favorites but I like that doge seems to want to be the global buck while the other three I mention as good choices would fit the bill so to speak as higher denominations I like Solana  it is very promising  But please be aware that there are some transparency issues I would recommend to watch this review and make your decisions https   youtu be PA1kA5yT1Ac I got this image from https   www coinparticle com i got in when it was around 8 dollars  After hitting 30 i just took some profit but i wish I didn t  This project is future  HODL ON Smart investment Solanium looks kinda interesting https   www solanium io What s IL RAY all day First  write your NY allowed exchange and ask then to start listing solana  Next This is still a bit tricky for new yorkers  You can use metamask and convert eth directly into into sol on sollet io or use Blockfolio FTX coinex to get some seed sol or to convert between some coins to Sol easily before having to enter into KYC  kind of a gray area   and then use raydium to do larger swaps with your sollet io wallet to get more sol  I wish there was a good way for someone to just  create an NY based faucet that just gave people the  00001 Sol they need to power one swap on sollet easily I ll look into all of these  but I think I can purchase in gate io  but it s such a pain because they re saying my password is too close to my email and I ve tried 20 unique passwords   literally Project starter rule no 1  don t half ass your logo  Sorry    trying to be positive  I know it s cosmetic  but it really does reflect an attention to detail and professional approach Maybe Solana  with all of their resources  could give new projects a bit of a marketing package to help them get started Have you tried  moonpay  https   www moonpay com Or u can use serum dex   serum dex  http   Dex Projectserum Com rojectserum Com U can use raydium with a sollet wallet and usdt  u can buy usdt or usdc I love raydium  for me in long term is very very strong  X10 is possible if solana continue getting stronger Is my better deccision  i use raydium to farm a bit and i am very happy with it Non militaristic Yes You added more accounts  They are blank Mate it s not working Yes a sollet wallet I opened two accounts Is it a sollet wallet  Did you have multiple accounts on it  Try clicking add account and put a random name  Also when you recover there should be some options to recover from try all three Yes but it keeps giving me a totally new address with none of the tokens I have on it Are you restoring with your seed COPE Don t worry about staking  but you can look at the pools Raydium looks like it s in a rebuy zone Lol no  just 450 Thousand Go get a phantom wallet Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post

Phantom if you d like to stake in Solana ecosystem haha i threw my lumbar pillow in the closet   i need room to slouch thanks for the thoughtful reply  makes sense Do not believe what media writes  Few months ago most of the media was writing that Bitcoin is a scam  They borrowed money from Shanghai to build their factory and they paid the loan in full n Q1   much earlier than they should Some media said that Tesla bought Bitcoin with the same funds that the Shanghai government gives to the Chinese Tesla factory as a grant  According to your logic  perhaps we should also thank the Shanghai government Hi thanks a lot for your answerHave a nice day Sol will continue to rise   forever    For real tho  I see 50  today to 100  very soon  150  Dawuer and 200  ish year end   250 beginning 2022 350 mid year 500 end year etc Plaaaatttyyyy my fellow Solflare and Sollet  I was staking for a bit  but returns were decent  I make more trading its ranges during these consolidation periods   13  18 for weeks  then now  40  49 for weeks   It s almost due for another shot upwards  What I find interesting  is when it establishes a new level after every single bull run  Any crypto news that is negative  SOL just stares at the other coins losing value  Thus  maintaining support in a narrow range even in bearish days  It s fun to trade that range  and a safe hodl Exodus Summer SOLstice     you sexy bastard got me buying more rn Solana pumping tho Damn I was Lowkey thinking this was sauce I will take this L haha Oh cool  What s the best wallet for solana staking  I bought mine on blockfolio Lol  As a Web developer  I can say most WordPress sites are written like crap  More plugins than holes on a heroin adict Your point makes sense though  I like solana  I do have eth though  I ve been holding for only around a month or two though Well that s comforting but I still don t quite get why the amount is a few percentage less than it seemingly should be  It seems as though the price presented is slightly higher than what it should be For example right now  according to Raydium  1 SOL   4 849515 RAY and 1 RAY   0 201798000 SOLbut if you multiply those ratios with each other they only become 0 978622428  when they should ideally produce 1 0 Yeah I was going to look up how staking works exactly  I m 23 and new to investing in general  is staking risky in anyway besides the usual dips in value of the coin itself Don t forget to stake it     10  extra while watching such a great project grow step by step is the best A lot of different ways to play crypto  I ve been up all night trading a few coins   200 into  800  Most my bets are on Solana  it s yet to catch the attention it deserves  but it s looking brighter everyday  When the summer SOLstice hits  I expect this to be  100  150 coin  Barring that ETH 2 0 w  help of Visa doesn t dominate the news It s not limit orders  it s swapping Heck yeah  Im planning doubling or tripling down in the near future before it goes up too high  just thought this would be a good start Damn deep pockets  Love it bro  Wise investment  SOL is top 5 coin in a few months  You ll thank yourself for the investment Sol is picking up steam  Still developing  no forks  lots of growth  no need for a V2  In modern parlance   it s almost Mac V Windows  In time people will see and then it ll be unstoppable this  Now I am trying to stake my ray and i get the same problem  Transaction confirming takes forever and nothing happens  Do you have a tip for that as well sir  another Token i have to add   P Care to elaborate SOLd me on it I m SOLja Boy No one really cares  as most here see it as a long term investment  Invest   HODL   watch it grow step by step I have different problem  I undelegate tokens bud i dont have withdrawl button just delegate again   And thats problem I have different problem I undelegate tokens and cannot withdraw them even new epoch start but i dont have button withdrawl just delegate again  I wanna stake more SOL just wanted to try stake and unstake but it doesnt work gt nd log out  you should see total including rewards on the staked amount  not on balance  After refreshing blit works  thanks gt    failed to send transaction   transaction simulation failed  error processing instruction   custom program error 0x1You need some SOL in your Sollet wallet  don t send the AMX amount  leave at least 0 000005 SOL into your wallet for Transaction Fee  gt failed to get recent blockhash   network error when attempting to fetch ressourceRPC node issues  try again later wallet  can see ur transactions via solanabeach io You can see the signs of that right now Why would there be slippage in limit orders Right  but most people want to be making  40 day in a few months and don t have the startup capital   On reddit you don t know if the person on the other end is 14 and teething  so I wanted to qualify itFor the average bloke  it s better to start a banano validator and put all your crappy computers to make  40 day Eth is going nowhere anytime soon   and the upside on solana is massive  90  SOL holder It s like any business   You start out in a money losing position with a plan to become profitable over time   In the case of Solana  you spend 5 grand to 10 grand making a computer and getting it hooked up to proper networking  then you spend  40 per day running it   Over time you try to gather stake until you are break even then keep gathering until you are profitable This is not ethereum where you are gonna make  2 000 per year   This is go big or go home   You are going to make tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands per year  or lose money   There is little in between https   github com agjell sol tutorials blob master solana validator faq md 12 Hi everyone  new to learning about Solana so I ll read through the FAQs before asking too many dumb questions  But first  what s a good dapp to try out from this graphic Thanks I have not used anything close to anything user friendly and intuitive as Elronds Maiar wallet  It shows that it s possible Don t they have millions of tokens unlock every so often on Ray  So it s very inflationary LOL That s why i m still poor what will happen to SOL in the bearmarket What will happen to SOL in the bearmarket The desktop app on my Mac updates all the time  the android wallet you have to actually click the blue stake bar and the amount in total is shown in the unstake button Well there s a few gaming chairs in there   but the overall lack of lumbar support is disconcerting I don t know yet What about Marinade finance  Also any program that runs as a native app and can give us Brett mobile applications to all of these projects It requires a very large investment  let s start with thatthe bar is set very high All you need to know is FTX couldn t do business on March 12 because Ethereum sucks  and the solution they re pegged on is SolanaThe rest of the world is slower at accepting that but a billionaire programmer that runs an exchange the way normal people run wordpress sites does not have time for ETH s bullshitThat is not to say ETH 2 won t be an improvement and doesn t have first mover advantage  But that s not a forward thinking idea  that s a safe hedge at best I think it s worth noting that it s a lot faster than they are talking about in the press  despite the current big number He s not 100  wrong  It still isnt fully centralised though but it does sacrifice some decentralisation is that a nickname   This photo is likely taken in an office in asia  no the alternative is boredom  which can be more devastatingimagine being that smart and having to interact with the rest of us I had the opposite reaction   Stupid gaming chairs are so warm and have forced awkward ergonomic assumptions   I much prefer open back mesh types 1000 Suitable accidental boner cover   I know the struggle Like all technological innovations  or even sports  Speed wins  Second to this is security  Solana has dominance in both regards  It s the sleeping giant  and high upside potential to directly compete with ETH in the near future Remindme  134 days Probably bc the leader based Byzantine consensus design is rather meh If it breaks  50 it s gunna run hot again  Keeps testing this resistance Anyway to use it on mobile That s a lot Cool  I just got it using the invite code for first 2k  not too late this time A sol hodl So many good ideas    really worth a look  https   solana com developers Yep  It s just super clean and simple and works with the ledger app 6ZRCB7AAqGre6c72PRz3MHLC73VMYvJ8bi9KHf1HFpNkWho dis are you using it already I love phantom  Hope it becomes the standard Where do I find more info on it   Any price predictions Haven t been on there in a while but last time I was it didn t update your total but there was a way to see  Click the stake button and go as if you are going to unstake  The unstake button will show you how much you have available to unstake which reflects your rewards  Kinda ghetto At  47 54 now   It s nice to see several coins moving independently  instead of trending with Bitcoin  Eth  etc Does anyone know if Exodus automatically updates your SOL amount while you re staking  or will you not know how much you ve earned until you unstake No moonlet Nice surge just now from  40ish to  46 50   I m a bit disappointed that the dip happened when I had no spare money to average down I sent the money to Binance What kinda chair he rocking  Looks nice Solana  Man I have fallen in love with this project
2021-05-17,46.89802269,51.87603133,43.30291605,Remindme  1 month That s for sure      Moonn Was also thinking  as lots of Solana is staked it s not so easy to sell on dip so looks more robust  which then will bring more people onboard fomo If you use sollet io there is a way to swap using metamask  You have to incur the gas fees for making the swap but it ll work No one actually knows bro just keep buying Solanabeach io Staking on FTX is very easy  Easy to compound the rewards back into staking also Accurate I m farming and Swimming in the pools at Raydium and spend yields on SOL  Can get pretty much 1 2 SOL a day at this point  Love Raydium for this ya right even all the other alt coins r down Exodus wallet for me  super simple to stake What about Texas  Was told Crypto com but no trade button restricted to americans you know now that i think about it you need some sol to create the token account for the wrapped btc in the first place    damn VET for the win In the technical documentation they explain how to mint token nft  It s actually quite straight forward you should have a look  a few CLI calls Plus th fees are super minimal Swap for it on exodus Gate io lists Sol Sure it s only a minor fee Binance and FTX both require KYC  So a VPN wouldn t help here   unless you were talking about needing a VPN for Sollet or Serum Raydium  Either way  I appreciate the help  Gonna give that a shot tomorrow  I haven t looked at Sollet at all   does that handle wrapping the BTC when it s sent  or would I need to wrap it first FTX  amp  Binance aren t available in all US states Where are you located   FTX is very simple to sign up for and there are  us and  com versions Why can t you use FTX or Binance   There are  us versions of those sites if you re in the USA  If you re still stuck  let me know Solana explorers definitely need a much more intuitive transaction history section  I really like the network  but this part sucks hard Sell your sol to the devil i have 0 8 of a coin can t really buy more right now you have 2 options that i know of if you cant get on ftx or binance  can convert eth to sol using metamask and sollet like u xdozex mentioned  or you can send btc to sollet  trade that wrapped btc for usdc usdt on either on serum or raydium  swap that for sol    amp  x200B i certainly wouldnt advise anyone to ever by any means sign up for a vpn account  thats a very bad idea as you could surf the internet uninhibited and access geo blocked sites content   those vpns are no good I ve only gotten SOL via the exodus wallet   Easy peasy just eat whatever swap fee I use exodus to exchange and blockfolio to buy You can get BNB on KuCoin i m in Yes  that will still be slower than Solana which is 50k TPS going for 1 million in the future and a slower transaction finality than Solana I own Algorand as well  undervalued  great SDK s  great tutorials  clean designs  The market manipulation to keep early investors happy and the slow progress for decentralization Estimated time was like 10 years last time   make its evaluation lower  I got Algo to hold for 10 years because I see it as a much longer term investment while I believe Solana is closer to being practical Solana is not completely decentralized either but they are much younger and have systems in place working towards decentralization  Believe the only thing really missing for them Other than hardware requirements  is automated slashing  To me it sounds easier for Solana than Algo to become amazing but I believe in both which is why I hold both but more Solana Why can you not just use a vpn with Binance I ve been asking the same question in every thread on Reddit and Twitter I come across  Haven t found a solution yet and been trying for like 2 months  There might be a way to bridge ETH over to Solana but I did that to get onto BSC  and hit a wall when I realized I needed some BNB to swap the ETH for any BSC token  I would imagine the same issue will spring up with the Solana bridge ya right i wouldn t have been able to stake my sol if it wasn t pos Is there a way to stake on trust If it reach 100 then everyone will give 1sol to him Would you trade equal   for another crypto  I cant use biance or freaking that fx site 135 but I don t even have a job right now  In about a month I ll start working my new job  I want to own 500 but I m afraid it will x2 before I even get close to that some people always say something sucks I cant use that fx site nor biance to buy some  how can i buy it  Would someone trade for some cardano  ETH or bitcoin Hodl Impermanent loss happens when the price of one asset differs relative to another one  Let s take a sol usdc pool for exampleAt  10 per sol in a sol usdc pool  if you LP with 10 sol you need 100 usdc  Total value   200 if you keep that same liquidity in at  40 per sol  you re not gonna get the same 10 sol back  you re going to get like 2 5 back   100   amp  the other  100 usdc   any trading fees incurred against the pool  on the flip side if sol tanks from 10   gt  1 after you LP  you re getting back 100 sol but you re gonna lose some usdc but still also receive trading fees  My math might be a little off but that s the concept behind IL  you re always going to lose a little the second the pricing between the pairs shifts too much but the compensation is in the trading fees  amp  staking incentives Algorand will soon have 10k TPS and then 46k TPS later this year  and 2 5 second blocks  https   www reddit com r AlgorandOfficial comments n412im algorand_will_roll_out_10k_and_46k_tps_soon I ll get downvoted to hell but whatever man   if you re not an expert  are nervous about SolFlare  and don t want to make a mistake    and you have very strong 2FA game at your exchange  not sms based  etc  there s no shame in staking there   That s the best choice for beginnersI did a quick search and  binance com  https   binance com   not the us version  has 10  APY staking  Not the worst thing if its just sitting in your walletOf course  not your keys not your crypto  etc   Understand the risks Use exodus for a wallet  Been using it for over 5 years now and it s great  Staking is 10 43  I believe Count me in for the bet too Moon awaited baby Vpn Too long to explain here  google and YouTube are your friend yeah sollet is a website it doesn t have an app it was built by the serum team  phantom doesn t have an app either it s just an extension  im not sure of anyone doing a mobile wallet yet but there are like 10k registrants for the hackathon i think No way Solana is down from  52 to  44  According to coin stats 16 2 coinsBut only discovered sol last week  I ll re up every payday  I love what the future hodls with sol Why is phantom better One note   the  current  epoch is an estimate based on voting performance of the validator in the current epoch  and average returns over the past 3 epochs   It is not guaranteed to be accurate  but should be pretty close    This is why  EST   estimated  appears in headings when this data is presented Data for prior epochs is 100  accurate though since it s completed data that cannot change Honestly because fees are so cheap  you can move between wallets needed that are better for different dapps  Phantom is imo the best one right now but because it is still in alpha beta  there are some dapps that don t support it yet  Sollet is supported by nearly everyone  Solflare is the wallet for staking  I stake 2 3 of my SOL and use the other 1 3 for Defi  buying NFTs  and putting into altcoins in the ecosystem Only thing is sollet doesnt have an app right Remindme  1 month This is the way I hope your right  though  200 feels even better Current amount is 1 782 if sol hit 80 would you have wanted more  lol  no but i think we see sub 40 sol one more time  maybe even low 30s which would be a blessing to scoop more  there s a chance sol could be a top 5 10 coin in the next 2 years which would be like a 65  increase in market cap from   12 now to like  20B  im seeing ltc in    10 w  18B   amp  BCH   9 w  20 4B  market growth   capital rotation could mean a much higher pt   50B mc would be like  140   amp  i hate to be that toxic community member but i cant get over the fact that cardano is worth  67B It wasn t a stupid answer tbf  The white paper is like 32 pages long  not exactly a novel  You could have read it in the time between when your first posted and now  Then if you have already done plenty of other research like you say then you could mix that in with what you just learned and answer your own questions It s ok asking questions but don t expect people to help and use their own time when you admit you haven t put any effort in yourself  You also sounded very entitled   selfish with the justification for being your busy life   you aren t the only one running businesses and raising kids That s the problem here  bit of a long reply but felt like I needed to make this clear to you I sold 1 million ADA at 40 cents because I thought it would go back to 20 cents  I ll never learn at this rate It s not a stupid answer  Have you read the whitepaper  If you haven t  you should  This is like ground level due diligence my man  regardless of the project Holding is buying and selling is shorting If you didn t have any  would you buy here The chart speaks loudly right now What I see is an asset that maintained its poised through multiple BTC dips sollet doesnt suck people just dont like that it doesnt have a sexy ui  it works perfectly fine and is compatible with everything  i also use solflare bc its the best decentralized staking solution from a user perspective    in terms of what to do with it down the line  my personal opinion is that the most capital efficient play is to lend out sol sell options against sol to generate income  obviously that infrastructure hasnt been built out yet  but its 100  being worked on through oxygen  jet protocol and psyoptions Yeah polkadot took me 30 days to unstake  Glad it did  price went up while I waited tho i got 276 add a bit more every paycheck gt and even its founder Charles cant give a direct answer when someone like Mark Cuban asked him over twitterNo  he just posted a little ecosystem infographic that was quite literally 90  bullshit lol  I wonder if Charles knows how bad Cuban bitch slapped him I m usually the guy that has the answers because of the amount of research I do  if someone is gonna be an ass completely ignore the question and give a stupid answer like read the white paper  im probably gonna be an ass back I don t blame you for coming and asking a question  However  saying this community is shit because someone gave you a tough love answer that you prob needed to hear    well  you re gonna get the kinda response you did I search hours a day on crypto     I asked for a few keypoints on why its better    so I could research those points  if you look at reddit it s full of questions  this the first time someone asked you something  This is what alot of people come here for No  don t try and make the sound like  this community is unhelpful  Your request is for someone  who has already took time to gain knowledge  to condense what they know it into bite size key points for you to absorb because you  don t have time  to do proper research yourself  I wasn t going to say it originally in an attempt to stay reasonably polite but your responses prove the kind of character you are   lazy and entitled This was amazing thank you so much If you re too fuckin lazy to do any research  then you shouldn t be putting your money into any crypto  Point blank  This isn t a space to have your lil hand held Also  you could have not acted like a child yourself and flew off the handle insulting the entire community  Shocker you got the kinda response you did  SMDH I asked a question I dont need sarcastic people telling me to read the whitepaper  I came here to get thoughts and opinions maybe to collect a general consensus on what the masses think  perception is everything my friend Ya  they re full of a bunch of grifters who will be happy to sell lazy entitled assholes like you on a token that has literally zero utility 50k tps on layer 1 with scalability up to a million compared to 15 tps ETH  couple hundred on ADA etcBasically no transaction fees because the network is so fast spam resistance does not need to be in place reason why other blockchains have high fees  Eth wormhole to convert over dapps Allows developers to make full use of blockchain technology  Most blockchains cannot be used right now because the fees outweigh the benefit of the network in a Dapp  Right now Solana looks like the best in the middle ground of the blockchain paradigm  decentralization less than ADA ETH  more than ALGO   most scalable  and right now none of the projects have proven to not be secure So it s pretty good and you have Sam Bankman Fried young intelligent billionaire  to promote and create an ecosystem I m sure if someone were to invest heavily or for the long term it would only make sense to do your own research rather than hearing it from someone else  I find a big difference between solana and communities like ada  some of them shill the ada beyond its actual use case  most of them are just really blinded by the growth in price  and even its founder Charles cant give a direct answer when someone like Mark Cuban asked him over twitter  I actually prefer the community here who looks more at the application  technology and growing ecosystem of solana rather than just its price  even though it has outperformed ada in the past 6 months lol  Either way  this post does a good summary and its what you re looking for https   www reddit com r solana comments n0hyad a_summary_of_solana_the_tech_and_why_it_is_the  utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf What a fuckin lazy piece of shit  What kind of entitled assholes comes into reddit and expects everyone to run their finances for them maybe check  this  https   www youtube com watch v VI8Rc0V4CWw amp t 565s  out Exodus wallet has been okay for my staking Sol so far Ok Karen   BOOMER whatever you are  Seriously who shit in your cereal Even Raydium support couldn t give me the numbers when I sent him the transactions How can a person trade with such a convoluted record keeping system Sollet is better bc you can connect to all the apps across the ecosystem imo 100  else Thanks appreciate you checking it out You should try TikTok  I am on there too talking crypto   shakedotdude Google I sold ETH a couple months ago thinking I d buy back lower   it kept rising   that investment would ve been 6x before this crash   I ve learnt that HODL is the way  amp  time in the market beats timing the market   you got this bro No this is the epitome of running 2 businesses and having 5 children and simply not having the time  yeah im out of here this community is shit  putting my money somewhere else Exactly  Great answer  they are a top coin so I might go place my money there then depending on the community  there market cap is just so high at the moment  ill give solana another chance if someone can at least give a credible answer without being a jackass Well this community seems helpful  ill take my money and pump someone else s bags then  could you imagine the negative impact you d have if you spoke like this to every investor  answer the question or don t  I know where the white paper is dumbass  if I wanted to read it I would 300 by March and I m being conservative Every time I ve sold to buy back lower Solana has screwed me due to this  I wish I could say I ve learned my lesson  Alas I don t have time  to write summaries of free and easily accessible information for you  YouTube has plenty of short overviews on there RemindMe 1 month Will be at  1000 or I will delete this true  i actually don t think this is      DamnMyAPGoinCrazy      Commands   opt out    delete I actually don t think this is true Stablecoin  eg USDT  purchased on paytrie and then sent to Binance  You can fun paytrie via interac Agree  Love the stability of Solana I was thinking the same thing  I love the stability of it I m not sure tbh Still learning a lot about crypto but why is this project better than CARDANO ada I came on here because I don t have time to read the white paper  those things take way to long  was just hoping for a few key points as to why it s better and then I can go from there  so one key point sounds like proof of history  anything else you might be able to help me with You have to take time to read and understand proof pf history  Whitepaper is on solana official website Pure class RemindMe 1 month Thanks guys You re an idiot bro Remindme  1 month Well idk anyone using anything on AVAX  amp  there are thousands of people on my Twitter using solana  Not that social media engagements are everything but it s something to note 10 1 gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them Cjwill2017  New to crypto   but with its current market cap and tokenomics  what do you see Solana reaching If you did apples to oranges with eth I d be more interested in the Solana vs Avalanche debate  I know at Avalanche they re trashing Solana as centralized all the time How are you buying solana I bought back some xlm after selling the previous lot  As it dropped a bit I m gonna exchange my eth being mined into sol in the future instead I bought back some after exchange as it fell a bit  XLM does have its use indeed gt validators appYea  this is really gret Actually  i think there is too much buyer demand lol  Alot of the vcs tokens are unlocked and very few have sold probably because of the fact that its such a competitor in the space and they don t want to Id much rather have companies that seed big improvements in the blockchain space have more power in crypto than bs companies like apple and google They are the ones that saw the vision and committed to the project early with a large sum of money  Do wish the distribution was abit more democratic but the vcs will sell over time and it will become more decentralized  At least it isnt internet computer lmao hopefully there is a lot of buyer demand to absorb the selling must be nice for them  pretty easy to make millions when you buy something for 1 100 of listed exchange price It would be nice if some more was distributed     I would like to add however  that many of the tokens are slowly becoming unlocked and the insiders will sell their tokens  will be able to sell Thank you  I ve been leaning towards this sort of thinking   the model Adam put together is very helpful Yes  that s exactly what it means  And most of the insider portion is unlocked  Founders are already billionaires can probably put together a xeon x99 build from ebay parts for under  2k for these specs   No gpu needed Sorry  I know much more about the technicals of Solana than I do about many of the services and or exchanges using them  so unfortunately I m not going to be able to offer you much info on HitBTC or where to pick up Solana I will say that I tried to sign up for a binance us account and it was a clusterf    of a process that took forever and never even completed successfully   Then I signed up with ftx us and it was done in a few minutes and worked perfectly after that   YMMV Ik  Project is good but not the tokenomics Damn  Doesn t sound good Has that number been achieved in the real world or was it done on a test net  Your question is kind of loaded  with the implicit assumption that doing it on testnet was not  the real world  The number was achieved on testnet   But testnet runs the same hardware  same software  same networks  same everything pretty much as mainnet There is some chance that there is a bottleneck on mainnet that does not exist on testnet due to the different transaction skew on mainnet I personally would love the chance to find out what that is  but that will only happen when Solana usage grows into tens of thousands of TPS on mainnet as someone from the UK trying to buy in now  can you help  binance halted the trading of it and i can t find anywhere else to trade for it Sounds great  Look forward to checking it out here gt when I picked NY amp  x200B Ah That s explains it I don t live in NY but from everything I ve heard about it  its incredibly restrictive when it comes to crypto exchanges  I m in TX and I have the exact same problem with Binance US  even though Binance is allowed in most of the rest of the country I m of the opinion that if you aren t directly buying crypto with fiat  exchanges have no business asking what state you live in  but whatevs  that s neither here nor there I suggest going to CoinGecko and looking up the exchanges that offer SOL trading pairs  Most will be unavailable to Americans  but some will allow us  Avoid Bithumb Global  because while they ll let Americans deposit BTC or UDST and exchange them for SOL  they suspended all SOL withdrawing in January and still haven t enabled it again  To avoid wasting time  before you even make an account for an exchange  look up their Terms and Services to see if they are prohibited from operating in the US or New York Failing all that  you could always look into the Serum or Solflare DEX s and completely bypass those centralized exchanges Welcome Those same market makers can pump a coin with the millions on their books My question is   how   when they need to Why did they need to  Why pick now  They don t even  need a narrative to explain a dip while everything else is dipping So excited for this  Welcome thanks this is helpful  i read more and it seems like Solana is a few miles ahead of ADA  but ADA has so much more hype in the media  Do you know the reason why still not late to correct the mistake    based on the enthusiasm I see for this project   seems like we are just getting started F y scammer  report So happy to see this  Solana can t be ALL serious defi  Long SAMO and SOLAPE Please explain how this would work  What exactly would the vcs do to prop up a price during a dip without losing money  Unless infact those vcs just have demand for the project and now is the time to buy more  What exactly are you alleging happend Agree with others on RAY  COPE  and SRM  More Degen with momentum would be SAMO  SOLAPE Donald duck dick go brr On the exodus subreddit they said a change is coming so    one can hope Looking into this now and it says this at the top  Native ETH can be converted to native SOL via MetaMask  To convert    you must already have SOL in your wallet    That last part has me a bit worried about sending ETH over without actually having SOL in there first  And it would also be difficult to fund future investments only being able to migrate up to 0 1 ETH into the wallet You can stake RAY for 42  APR which is built on Solana  You can dual farm as well but I haven t done that yet Yeah that was pretty funny  I know Anatoly has a sense of humor  hes always chuckling  Love solana Binance Binance  or Binance US  And do you know the withdrawal limits off hand for unverified accounts Use the Thorswap app or pancakeswap Yes that looks similar  It will have a higher fee then a typical exchange but it was the only route I could do besides getting a vpn  The route I did prior to that was connect metamask to sollet but those fees are even worse  especially now that eths network is clogged gt Stealthex ioIs this similar to Godex  If so  I m guessing the fees are going to be much higher than buying on an exchange   but at this point it s better than not having a way to get any SOL  So I might have to give it a try  Thanks What s the rate on SOL staking I tried my best to clear up any misconceptions I hear there are people running Cardano stake pools on RPI4 One of those   how did I not know this   situations  I feel dumb  Thanks HAHA  KYC   Know your customer gt No gaming rig has 128 GB of RAM  what are you talking about im very much not a tech person by any means but multiple people ive talked to on twitter have made the point that the hw reqs are achievable for people  anatoly said he could rig a ps5 dev kit to run a validator so idk  lets say im wrong and your rig will cost you 15k  to build  plus another 10 sol a month for a year lets say thats about 6k    50 sol   that s 21k to get a rig and enough sol to run it for a year  plus electricity costs  still better than 32eth  this is assuming that you do zero marketing and outreach to attract delegators which again  there are many people like myself out there that are willing to delegate sol to a smaller node in order to boost decentralization in the network I had no idea  the only time I tried signing up  it prompted me asking for what state I live in  and when I picked NY  it wouldn t let me proceed  All of these exchanges that let users sign up with KYC usually block withdrawals until KYC is completed  So I just assumed FTX would be similar  Do you know if there s any limit to the amount you can trade withdraw without completing KYC  Only asking because with situations like this  I m always apprehensive to do too much  in case they decide to lock down the account when I go to withdraw Oh and with this process  did you use FTX US  or just the normal FTX Just an analysis So edgy SOOOO in depth 100  agree gt  Most validators are running on SOL delegated by the foundation very true unfortunately  i appreciate this dialogue bro fr i always welcome fresh perspectives thanks for your answer  it did not work  I already published it in discord de serum and reddit https   www reddit com r ProjectSerum comments neohbj i _have _a _problem _at _the _time _of _settlefunds _with   https   www reddit com r ProjectSerum comments neohbj i_have_a_problem_at_the_time_of_settlefunds_with ill remember that Who s your friend lol it s been a month gt you can get a validator for the price of a sturdy gaming rig    on the very expensive side lets call it 10k No gaming rig has 128 GB of RAM  what are you talking about  gt i agree  you need too much sol for someone to just get started but  no minimum stake required to simply participate vs 32eth  gt  100kYou actually need to    spend    SOL to participate  right now  about 10 SOL a month Perhaps validator pools  although I don t like some of their side effects  will make running a validator for  normal  people viable  but right now  running a validator without the support of the foundation is basically impossible if you re bullish on sol then read this for better more complete thoughts than I I can make  https   twitter com adamscochran status 1385291204938674189 s 21 Same   XLM and Solana are big players in my portfolio Thanks I hold both personally  they solve different issues and both have great tech eth is very good at being a trustless decentralized network  we re just experiencing performance issues at scale  Mostly  bc eth 1 0 wasn t built to be performing at scale like this  its main priority is being ultra decentralized  and fees and speed are something they re trying to solve  but I  think it s inherent infrastructure will hold it back in that category vs networks like solana  which I think will be able to handle mass adoption and have links to eth in the future yes gt both   are good  and both are good at different things i agree but eth 1 0 is ok  not good  i say this   only   bc im broke  amp  literally cannot afford gas to compound yield  jump in and out of pools etc  solana is catching up to the robustness of ethereum very quickly One currency to rule them all  to the fires of Mt Doom I know there s a Lord of the Rings reference in here somewhere i had 90 but had to take a bit profit by selling 40  Now i have 50 solana  F    me right  Wish i didn t sell amp  x200B The only drawback I see is that they haven t implemented slashing yet and haters will say it is insecure Blessings Bruh I m2 3 as well Polygon is running crazy too Proof of History isn t a consensus mechanism  Solana operates using Proof of Stake like many other altcoins  Proof of History is just the mechanism that the blockchain uses to build its blocks  Its what enables the blockchain to be hyperperformant  Staking with SOL works like many other altcoins  Here s an overview  https   solana com staking gt You need enterprise grade hardware to run a Solana validatoryou can get a validator for the price of a sturdy gaming rig    on the very expensive side lets call it 10k   amp  x200B  gt you need to stake enough SOL to cover the costs of running the validator  hardware network voting costs   So you need to stake about 3 000 SOL just to break even  at a SOL price of  45  i agree  you need too much sol for someone to just get started but  no minimum stake required to simply participate vs 32eth  gt  100kwith everything comes a tradeoff and solana is by no means perfect but for me as a user  ethereum is simply unusable  im not a developer or code or anything  amp  have looked into running my own solana node  amp  came to the same conclusions as you  its too cost prohibitive layer 2s will connect layer 1s as layer 1s begin to specialize and focus on certain things  like solana on performance and scalability  as eth focus is on being decentralized as possible  both  are good  and both are good at different things Sweeet  Many thanks  Gunna transfer the rest from Binance and stake as well  Every hour is good   They should really say that on FTX info for staking What color you gonna get  Im thinkin ill wrap mine solana and eth are not competitors  they compliment each other they both have their focuses  some more depth into that below if you wanna have a read https   twitter com adamscochran status 1385291204938674189 s 21 omg see u at the lambo dealership Solana will realistically reach 200 gt No  it is not  Users have strong incentives to stake with validators with a proven track record and a far larger stake not if you re ideologically supportive of the blockchain  ive delegated several staking accounts to smaller validators just bc they got recommended on discord  if you run a node and acitvely market it online  people will eventually stake to you if your uptime is competitive  32eth   3300 is 105 600  you could spend a fraction of that on a pc  some sol  amp  solid meme marketing and you d start getting delegators  i saw this one account like 10x the number of sol delegated in a matter of weeks amp  x200B that being said i do agree with you that you need way too much sol in order to break even factoring in overhead Me too  cannot swap USDC for Cope for some reason For SOL they pay interest every hour  So you get it in small bites  The reward interest is unstaked and you can trade with it or stake it as well  There is no time limit  But if you are level1 KYC you can only stake up to  12 500 worth of coins Aside from  brand recognition  might as well go with a better blockchain over ETH 2 0 Are you from the US 1   Disconnect  amp  connect your wallet  amp  try again 2   Try other browser s than the one you re having problem with If this doesn t help  head to Serum    Telegram    https   t me ProjectSerum  Support Group or Their    Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6   the best choice IMO Oh wow  you re amazing  I m still waiting for my pending account on Binance  what do you think about HitBTC or where to pick up solana How do you feel about staking on FTX  it s 10  apy I m long XLM and SOL XLM one of the few coins with s proper use case and users  Surprised you converted it Would ve picked a different alt I was told 2 3 of my crypto in SOL is crazy  Who is laughing now      me Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns I need to start staking my SOL   Is Exodus the best way   One question I thought SOL was a Prof of History  POF  block chain  how does staking fit into the SOL Blockchain That s a fair point   when I stake I go to the larger guys who take no fees  Something needs to be done to push me to stake my SOL with the smaller guys  But I am sure this is something that will come with time I get what you re saying now  I didn t really see the context  I m not going to tell anyone not to use something that works for them right now  of course they stopped supporting the coin   can t find it there The point is that he was  trying to decide between chains  while considering something that may or may not happen in a year  A week is a lifetime in crypto  let alone a year  Why would you potentially dismiss something while waiting that long for another LMAO You need enterprise grade hardware and most validators just rent hardware on data centers  Having said that  the comparison to Eth2 energy consumption based on that is a bit disingenuous  Ethereum scalability will rely on sharding   zkRollups Validity proofs are computationally intensive to create  so that should be baked in into the future energy consumption budget of Ethereum  Obviously  it will be far less than it currently is  but higher than whatever number they re quoting right now Also  on Ethereum  if you have 64 ether  you have to set up 2 validators  So it causes some waste from that angle as well Wait  so if I have 1 sol  I m going to have to pay a renters fee for having a wallet interesting comment  what have you found that can be run with a rpi and solar panels  that s a neat concept i d love to learn more about Binance Any reason why solana gt xlm  Asking for a friend Please stop posting on Solana The comment I was looking for haha Ethereum validators are extremely cheap in comparison to Solana validators  You need enterprise grade hardware to run a Solana validator  with high recurring costs  most Solana validators are in data centers  and you need to stake enough SOL to cover the costs of running the validator  hardware network voting costs   So you need to stake about 3 000 SOL just to break even  at a SOL price of  45  If you re relying on delegated stake  you need to attract around 40 000 SOL to break even I m in the US so can t participate and time is over to quality  Thank you tho But not every chain has the same amount of dapps  tvl  and the same throughput Ok but every other PoS blockchain also has low tx fees One of the biggest reasons people are on Solana is because of the fees   time to max confirm a tx  I think it s important to reiterate that even tho you think it s Cardano esque Attracting capital is actually not that difficult  If you get a rig build a node and start reaching out to individual stakers you could rise up the list very fast  From a cost perspective it s still cheaper to get a rig  amp  get enough sol just to participate than it would be to do it on ethereum No bc even when ETH rolls over to 2 0 in 1 3 years it will still have issues of composability and more questions around decentralization  32eth for a node is not cheap did you find a solution to this More features will be implemented over time  Yes  it s a dashboard but there will be features added to manage everything from step  Whether you want to compound  jump in to a pool  jump out  claim your rewards  etc  now  whether you think that is worth it or not because there will be some small fees for the convenience  is up to you where did you purchase RUNE Binance US swaps are not available at the moment it seems like  due to the Solana pump there is no liquidity  you d have to buy in Trust wallet or transfer after buying on an exchange IDK about FTX  but the US Binance site is on a state by state basis  In my state  its prohibited I m mean not that I ve seen so far besides ordinary risks of staking Uphold is a no go  They don t let you transfer SOL out of their ecosystem  and they force you to hold it online in their custodial wallets Can I transfer from BNB Thank you very much for the detailed explanation  It s crystal clear now As others have said  you only need to do the KYC ritual on FTX if you want to buy SOL with fiat currency  You can set up an account and transfer BTC or USDT to FTX without going through the ritual  That s how I got my SOL  Sent some USDT to the exchange  made the spot purchase at market value  then transferred the SOL out to my wallet You can get a whole list of exchanges offering SOL trading pairs on Coingecko  Try looking there  I was able to use FTX to buy mine  but I m guessing you are in a different state than me Yea i know its weird how they did it  hopefully they fix this in the future on exodus Hi i needcsome Help  im a proud holder and stacker of solana in ftx   but i Just wanna to diversify a little in polkadot and other  like 30  in some others promessing projects  but ftx doesnt have a Lot of alt coins options   How can i proceed  Buy the alts in another Exchange  Which one  Perp on ftx What brought you to the breakeven point of 1 8 million Buy USDT with money  then find the pair SOL USDT in binance pro  open it and click on buy  You are basically trading USDT for SOL and 1 USDT   1 USD I see it now thanks That  s a complete different thing  Just google about Metamask and Hacks  or Uniswap and Hacks und you will change your mind Go to the stake menu on solana and at the bottom where it says unstake   theres a number amount there  don t click unstake  that amount should be more so subtract that from the main shown balance and see how much you earned This is exactly why BTC maximalists are so annoying  They act like they are gonna replace the dollar when the reality is that the fall of the dollar and the rise of crypto literally means there will no longer be a need for one currency to rule them all This may be a stupid question but I have been staking my Solana on exodus for 2 weeks now I don t see any change in my amount  Where would I see this It means that the validators no longer hold any data associated with the account   There will be historical records held on any RPC node that keeps long term records though   For example  the Solana Foundation keeps a large database of all the blocks  so every state that the account ever went through will be represented at least there   Unfortunately  this archive of the block chain is not publicly available  yet  All data stored on validators is paid for  either by rent  paid by accounts that don t retain a rent exempt reserve  or by holding a minimum amount of SOL above the rent exempt reserve threshold within the account When an account does not meet the rent exempt reserve  it pays rent  which will eventually draw it down to zero balance  unless of course more SOL is added to the account periodically to compensate  Alternately  a user may themselves transfer all of the balance out of the account Once an account has zero balance  it is not being paid for any more  so it is deleted from the validators to free up disk space   However  the account has no worthwhile data to keep so deleting it doesn t  lose  anything If you still have the public private keypair stored locally  you can always re constitute the account by sending some SOL to it   Then it will re appear on all  validators storage and suddenly exist again within the Solana blockchain To summarize  accounts with no balance are deleted from validators  but nothing of value is lost in the process since a zero balance SOL account has no data associated with it at all   You can always send SOL to any account  even one that previously had no balance  and thus didn t exist in validator storage   and it will be re constituted in validator storage for the purpose of holding the data representing the new account balance ETH 2 0 is a dirty hack that barely solves a problem Solana solved gracefully Day 0 gt If ETH 2 0 is successfulYou mean if ETH 2 0 ever actually happens  As far as I m concerned  ETH 2 0 is vaporware Yea the only thing I don t like in exodus is the amount you earn   org investments shows in the unstake balance not in your main balance You re welcome   Let me know if you ever have any questions or concerns with the validator Thank you both for your kind words and support   I am very happy to be a part of the Solana community and hope to continue to contribute where I can Thanks  I ll look into it Mercurial finance this thursday Solana is a longterm hold  dont know why their store annoncument spiked a fall Did that one and got 1 6 slm  Wondering if any more are coming up SOL First time Sol buyers be like  including me   All my portfolio is color red  I need some green in my life  I dont care about anything anymore  Let me put some money in this altcoin    Wow it is going up   Copium   lol Slim token airdrop just ended  I get 0 63 slim and I participated with only one ticket I believe the hardware required to run a validator is around  10k  I could be way off with that figure tho I m still holding my XLM stack  Love Solana too though KSM is at ATH also and RUNE is up 7  this week both those projects are bullish as hell to    gota love making money why everything else is tanking Probably also due to the fact SOL is clean  revolutionary next gen technology which is in stark contrast to BTC and why BTC is selling off  The market has decided to award energy efficient innovation and SOL is the beneficiary due to solid fundamentals Oh God can we not do this pathetic crap  This is right out of the ADA playbook  It s tired and lame SOL can stand on its own merits  talk about its tech not tearing down ETH for its current fees Go back and play on Hoskinsons farm gt Since when is paying more in fees than the value of your trade a working product  Nobody goes there it s too crowded  ETH fees were very low even as recently as last year  The reason fees are high now is because people keep bidding them up and up to try to get a piece of Ethereum s more than a million transaction per day capacity well if someone lives in ny  me  gate io isn t an option https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1rNVWSmCZUN2n16J2qRIAc8f _XZ3v6HnDU _N9IgvMFV8 edit gid 0

The ecosystem is growing faster than I can keep up the chances of a multi chain world are much higher than one chain ruling everything I had some weth that I was trying to swap back to eth  then send to kraken for staking  but it was going to cost me like  300  It s absurd  So yeah  basically stuck in that position unless I want to eat the fees Waiting for  Moonbeam  https   moonbeam network   on Polkadot myself  It s an Ethereum compatible blockchain Also  Moonriver  is their sister project on Kusama which is launching this summer that s just to pull liquidity from a weth usdc pool smh If you say so You are correct that the inflation reward rate decreases over time  15  yr   However if SOL continues to grow in value over the next 5 10 years you might end up with some nice passive income  NFA Check out raydium io You re a credit to the Solana community  This is really great info and I see you constantly helping people on the discord as well   keep up the great work The kin ecosystem is migrating still  Check this out https   www reddit com r KinFoundation comments ndnqy7 kin_has_by_far_the_most_wallets_on_solana  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share Nah  VET s best days are a long time ago  HAM or VER Sol holding strong and 10  apy  great long hold Gate io crypto exchange allows users in 49 states within the US to trade the spot crypto market except for Washington State and New York State I mean  they have a point for some projects  but Solana is certainly not one of them  It may not be as full featured yet  what is    but it currently does things eth will never even be able to do  central limit order book dex for example  and it s growing exponentially by the day You gonna just wait for a year or two while everything else passes you by I think in certain states like NY they re restricted It s more expensive to do it this way than to use ftx anyway  Check my message above and just use ftx You only need to go through kyc to buy with fiat  One way to do it is to buy usdc in coinbase  send to ftx  buy sol there You can use Binance without KYC and with a VPN  The trade and withdrawal limits are just lowered  but still usable  Ive been using it for about a year now unverified if you live in the usa  get ExpressVPN  set it to canada and try again This is very helpful  thanks Keychron K6 with Gateron Reds is a great knife for the price you ll pay you 300g

embarrassment I like the network also  but one of the fundamental properties of the public blockchain is transparency  If it is incumbent upon me to parse a hundred arcane records to get a summary of a single token swap  I have to wonder how useful it is for anything I have like  50 left on Uniswap from a rugpull that I ll never be able to get out I hate these posts like a passion  Asking us like we have to pitch to him  Just go away you pleb Only 112 I hope you don t  but I ll take mine Exactly why I m trying to decide between chains  I realise Solana is fast  but Ethereum has a huge community  If ETH 2 0 is successful  surely it will beat all other chains My favorite is when they look down on other projects   They don t even have a working project  Since when is paying more in fees than the value of your trade a working product  If it costs more than CeFi  what s the point of your DeFi Wrong sub booboo The cognitive dissonance ETH maximalists have about this is downright astounding Kin is the most used crypto in the world by real users with 44million wallet not sure how there is any other options not sure how you could pick something else really hello  i ve recently

you     i have the same problem 2500 SoL 71 I own some SOL  but the reason is just not fees That is one reason to use an alternative to ETH   Even a centralized exchange would be a good reason Thanks for your answer Waiting for  1 000  that is where it will be before the end of the year  Accumulate the dips and hold on As you may know HotBit had a major security breach lately  so probably withdrawal feature is not enabled yet for all coins   tokens I think raydium is undervalued currently and can yield nicely Im in ny and I use binance to get sol I get it but no one else with same

Why not use DEX  It will show prev trades RemindMe  1 month Your  comment saying  yeah  Right     Or yea right  Bc either way SOL goes up Solflare   love it  You also see your stake grow all the time You won t be able to live off of passive income though  there is a limit as to the amount of Solana that can be created and with time staking won t reward you as much  Please correct me if I am wrong someone SOLSummer See Sol being at 99  in one month ONLY 138       You were lucky Perfect happy to remind you You don t have to buy a whole sol  Just put 10  20     or whatever you can  Imagine it goes as high as BTC  You d still make a fine profit Nope  Solana bridge doesn t have that issue  You can convert ETH directly into SOL  not just ETH into SPL ETH  SPL is Solana s version of ERC20   Go on the Sollet wallet and click deposit on SOL and go to the Native ETH option and you ll see what I mean Use both 74 The max supply is wrong 123 sol I have I am farming with raydium dumb q   when I download exodus   it doesn t prompt to create a profile is the wallet unique to every download  app install Seriously A year really isn t that long in terms of major releases and upgrades  And rollups are coming sooner Yes maybe but i go long term with this  i am in ray tether  with stable coin u cancel 1 variable of the impermanent loss but in mid_short term is a risk to consider well done apes        let s break 60 Yea I know I misspelled lol Mate please don t stalk anyone or you are might end up to jail Some of them can be pretty lucrative  but you have to factor impermanent loss So   are there liquidity and pool farms for Solana that are as high yield as the ones on BSC   D Solana moving up as btc falls You must be referring to a liquidity pool farm  Solana staking is about 11 Proudly saying 8 88 as a new joiner today H o l y m o t h e r Stay away from Binance its one big mess and I am being polite now  I heard XML got super low fees  maybe buy them and exchange in exodus If you are using it I am following audius but I am Not sure what the Token is about  does it have any value  Or is it  just  a governance token for future references  how can I now what token do I get in my sollet wallet  I have another Unknown token with the token address  HAgX1HSfok8DohiNCS54FnC2UJkDSrRVnT38W3iWFwc8  Is there any  group or someting to check this token addresses  Solana explorer just says Unknown token eveyr time there is no reason i should not stake  right  unless i want to sell  10 years from now  and even then it only takes 72 hours to unlock PM me with details Yeah I made another reply  Changed to an edit any worries about impermanent loss  Feels like SOL is gonna outpace ray heavily at least short term  jw how you think about it Cheers APR APY Try solfarm Well said  As crypto evolve we need to catch up too  If POW keeps going then what  A 1000W GPU to mine the same amount of coins  That s like increasing the wages of your employees by few folds to produce the same value of product Definitely not too late my guy  Solana is vying for top 5 once this hackathon is over 39 2 Coincidentally bought in at 39 as my first crypto purchase I am excited for the future of this project Well  I m more A DeFi head yield farmer than a miner or a trader hehe  Staking is a bit different but it is more meaningful to me ecosystem than just yield farming Thanks  good to know Raydium  Cope and of course Serum as you mentioned  A ton really  but those can get you started It s getting me excited to find out how staking works  I might just swap all my ETH being mined afterwards to stake more crypto You work hard then you invest Thanks Thanks Thanks  I ll give this a go Oh it is the future  I strongly believe that  But I am spoiled by the high APRs APYs of the BSC blockchain  So I am waiting for similar projects on SOL ecosystem  Hehe Buy SOL herehttps   www pionex com en US sign ref yqdTr2bh Everyone talks about a VPN   but never tells you how to use it on Bianance I m new to stalking so i really don t know  but SOL seems to be a safe bet for it s market cap and technical background Haha haven t tried yet  Thank you for the info What about swap to raydium then stake for 40   Heard that can be done too Tell me if I have been ripped lol Exodus  10 41 Contact Serum Support         Telegam    https   t me ProjectSerum          Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6        Sollet is their product  they are the best ones for this matter  You re not the only one getting this error lately Where you compound  What is the APR APY of the contract you are using I also use binance and you can t buy SOL with euro but you can buy SOL with BTC  So i just buy first BTC and then i exchange it with SOL  I think that s the easiest solution within the binance app Can anyone help me put the solana colors an image that I already have  Need this for my shitposting on Twitter  Will pay Take a look at Audius  i think this is a very promising project  It s essentially a music streaming service which facilitates direct transaction between listener and creators  kinda like SoundCloud but on the blockchain  It already has a working product with about 1mil monthly users  check out their app   Also  its backed by some big names in the music industry  this is big plus since at this point they have a fully working product and just need to grow the community  It uses ethereum for staking and governance and Solana for their  content management system Lol I want to MOVE  60USD of DNT and they charge me that much  I lost  40 when I was new  Stupid ETH Stealthex io Stealthex io no kyc   allows limitless swaps 4 seconds  I do it all the time  Use it  i promise you will be impressed  Everything seems instant  Its also  4 seconds when placing limit orders on the decentralized exchange serumNever had to wait multiple blocks He is an amazing guy indeed  so helpful  amp  a great add to the whole Solana community about as broke as the rest of you You could 1  Verify that all words exist in the word list  and are spelled the way they are spelled there   https   github com bitcoin bips blob master bip 0039 english txt  https   github com bitcoin bips blob master bip 0039 english txt 2  Check that the number of words is correctIf it s a misspelled word that s easy to fix by cross checking with the word list  If it s a missing word your best bet would probably be to bruteforce your way through the word list  trying every word in every possible location  With just one word missing that should be a lot of work to do by hand but still manageable  With multiple words missing there s probably no way around having   someone you trust   build a script for you that tries the possible combinations So when Eth transitions to POS you are saying that solana is gonna be useless is WOOF gonna be SOL DOGE im surprised this hasnt happened on BSC yet   Even SHIB is also ETH Solana takes  4 seconds for block finality  Not sure where you got the minute but its completely wrong  amp  x200B Also  the fact Solana is already winning with token distribution  tps  and block finality time in 1 year of being up is a feat  Its the reason so many devs are building amazing dapps in the ecosystem this looks like fixed apr staking with 72 hour lockup I would argue decentralization is more than ADA because a node on SOL costs 3 4k and a node on ADA costs around 10k apparently To the moonnn I don t know what to do to help you  but under no circumstances should you send anyone your seed phrase Average people usually won t  requires about 3 4k to start one  The thing is  is I feel its decentralized enough if almost any person on earth can feasably run a validator if they really wanted to  Doesnt mean its easy  but it s possible Receiving Native ETH only works with MetaMask for me  How did you do it differently nice try Solana doesn t force a choice between CR  amp  scale  As the network grows  amp  more validators join  solana becomes more decentralized and performance increases  It s much more accessible to buy a pc rig  amp  start validating txs on Solana than getting 32eth to spin up a node on Ethereum so I d argue that s more decentralized  amp  more censorship resistant Thank you so much for being such a valued member of the community  We all appreciate the node and your work to develop these websites    Decentralize finance       amp  x200B I ve actually been staking to Blade Validator for a while now  What a coincidence that is you lmao Hmmm  not sure tbh  Maybe try ftx if that s not possible or too hard to get AUD for you KYC  I thought it was KFC or KY jelly Do the APY across staking options fluctuate Is there any risk to this outside the obvious I looked into this recently and the recommended requirements were crazy like a 12 core  and 128GB of RAM  How are average people supposed to run their own node with those type of requirements I absolutely agree with you  That s what I said up there  that Ethereum solutions to scaling are forcing users to choose between censorship resistance and scale Shilling BSV on a Solana sub    bags pretty heavy huh I think you should look deeper into Solana and why sharding is not the best scaling solution for censorship resistant high throughput blockchains For those asking  why NOT Solana      Here s why     Proof of Stake   Nuff said   Stick to the original  stick to Bitcoin BSV Changelly will swap for sol  That is where I get mine Yikes oh  never mind then  I saw some contracts for staking  PundiX  require   1k   to redeem

What is your telegram channel I like your design of Raydium landing page Looks good Messari oversimplify that infographics  here is what the distribution really look like     The token supply distribution is as follows     Seed Sale tokens comprise 16 23  of the total token supply   Founding Sale tokens comprise 12 92  of the total token supply   Validator Sale tokens comprise 5 18  of the total token supply   Strategic Sale tokens comprise 1 88  of the total token supply   CoinList Auction Sale tokens comprise 1 64  of the total token supply   Team tokens comprise 12 79  of the total

solana  https   research binance com en projects solana  amp  x200B Saying insider hold 48  of token is about right   but it s not that scary after you breakdown the distribution thats my view as well   it really adds up over time i like the marketing overall   its very well done Nice  do you have twitter and discord account Ftx us Thanks Binance US  But if you transfer it to Exodus after you buy it  you ll earn like 12  APY on it  It s all here in  My Spreadsheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y edit  that compares interest rates of 130

avax Solanabeach io looks like VC s know how to hodl Hi  I m in NY and would like to buy Sol  Is this the way only works for now   I def would like to try  Thank you This post aged well            I know it s only beeen a day   but I am an ape aftrrall same issue today Mind me ask how is it different from say  mining in a pool  As in I m so new to POS so I really don t know how it works  Gotta catch up on my knowledge How so  Elon admits that if a rocket doesn t explode then he s not pushing hard enough  You re a real word smith aren t you Join the club  Never too late  You might think it s expensive because it rose 7000  in a year  but the price is not the issue for concern  it s whether or not that particular asset you wanna invest in worth that buying price or not Well you said  Americans  not New Yorkers I m based in HK  so I use wirex to buy XLM  then use changenow to exchange 2 3 portion of XLM to SOL on exodus  and the 1 3 XLM is transferred to my lobster XLM wallet I m sorry man I don t remember the username  I immediately dumped all my Solana and unsubbed from the discord server after I got it unstuck I was so over it lmao  I promise you someone will help you though if you go on the Solana discord and ask for help  All he needed was the txn hash and my public wallet address and all was well literally within minutes  Solana has one of the best communities in crypto  this little bug just left a bad taste in my mouth lol Avax Twitter is large as well Yea there are always going to be trade offs in terms of decentralization and speed scalability for these dapp blockchains  It s nearly impossible to say what the right balance is  We won t really know until regulators start trying to push into the space I guess  will definitely be an interesting next few years  Also  I nearly did a double take when I saw your username  A few characters off from mine lol This was eye opening   glad to see other folks aren t worried  personally this explains to me why the price is so high right now  Isn t there an interview with the founder where the interviewer asks about this and the answer gets edited out Have you tried ftx com Just got myself another 5 47 SOL  Now 14 35 SOL on stake How much can we expect 2 0 to honestly cut down on these fees network congestion if people continue to join the network  Even if 2 0 can cut the above fee by 90  it s still excessive compared to existing alternatives such as Solana and XLM You can use the test nest to get test coins  they aren t real  but you can use them to develop with   Learning how to develop on Solana is actually really fun  especially if you have a programming background  I d start with the solana twitch channel to watch some videos on fundamentals  and then make sure to read the documentation on Solana com  The discord channel is a great resource  and there is a hackathon in progress  so lots of excitement  You probably don t need to study blockchains all that much  because the chain itself is already built  Definitely read up on how Solana differs from other chains  The most important thing to know about solana app development is that it is very  account  centric  and rewardingly fast to develop on  The 2nd most important thing  is making sure to write validations  lots and lots of validations yeah  adam usually has really solid perspectives  i ve learned a lot and gained really good perspective from following him  he posts well thought out threads often Nice  Maybe chat with star atlas I concur  What people want is speed and  cheap costs  Solana is built for both I hold Sol I bought a different coin on Gemini  which doesn t offer sol  then moved it to my exodus wallet and exchanged for sol Yup  C and C   are supported  I think that opens a lot of possibilities because a lot of languages are implemented in C C    As a dumb example  I know there s library to put the R statistical language inside a C   program  so now I m tempted to make some kind of R compiler interpreter for writing Solana smart contracts  No idea what the use case would be though lol  But generally  you can do some crazy stuff using C   with other languages eth community is going to freak out when SOL hits the top ten It will flip BSC then ETH 2 0 Sure hope so  what year is the question SOL will flip BSC first and then ADA  lastly ETH 2 0  It wIll be in the top 5 Generally HODL is the best and safest strategy  Trading generally is for faster profits but with higher risk and you need some more skill for it  If I were you I would just buy more during a dip and HODL for a min of 5 years  Its not too late yet Happy birthday    and we all love this project equally as much Thanks for the research  You made me understand it more  The complicated technical stuff  you made it easy to understand Don t let being a billionaire spoil you its decentralized lite lol LOL idk it just felt right at the moment so I went with it LOL Hidden ass kicker xkcd  Hyphen  https   xkcd com 37       Beep   boop    I m   a   bot         FAQ  https   pastebin com raw vyWra3ns Yea I feel ya  But SOL is backed by all the big dogs it seems  Kinda like a lesser known  almost hidden ass kicker of a coin  It s one I bet a lot of rich people are loading up on line crazy All about initial capital  fingers crossed though haha Solana es lo más username checks out Not as much of a millionaire as your mother    I  am  a  bot   Downvote  to  remove    PM  https   www reddit com message compose  to YoMommaJokeBot   me  if  there s  anything  for  me  to  know Damn I wish I got in that early  Good for you  keep holding my man  you ll be a millionaire in 1 2yr both are fine projects honestly   there will always be complaints about exchanges What do you guys mean by the APY  Is that automatically staked if you hold it on binance  amp  Binance US exchange  Or is it just Binance  etc  what s up w that I did the same with Polkadot  I bought back in after missing its rise from about  19 to  25  What is the message in the story  Choose a token you like  stick with your choice  and just hodl There really is nothing I hate more than getting my ERC20 tokens stranded on an exchange somewhere simply because the transaction fee would eat the entire original purchase of coin Really  this damn coin never dips I swear LOL  I got in back in February  so was kind of early to get this one  but as long as I ve had it not a single dip  Sure some negative days  but barely  This is the least Volatile coin I ve seen  It s the best long term coin ever to hold  And it may seem like it s slowly gaining  but it s actually going pretty fast  It s no pump n dump BS  SOL is the real deal No doubt  It s a matter of when  not if Most not all  Maybe 11 15 or 11 20 20 to 50  apy Hold it  I bought at 10  quite some and still holding Nice work on the info Wish you an ATH birthday Nice Twitter name i believe exodus is one    but u can only stake thru their validator i guess Google HODL  Here you go https   www investopedia com terms h hodl asp anyone The foundation is using the vast majority of its supply to delegate stake to validators  I wouldn t worry much about that if I were you Not sure how common it is but I recommend checking moonlet wallet for now  I just linked my ledger to the wallet and it showed my staking accounts instantly  I know Phantom wallet is going to add staking but it s currently in beta Wheres a good exchange to buy sol I don t know what I m talking about but can you make a Stardew Valley like game where you can have representations of NFT purchases displayed in the game  such as digital art could somehow be represented in a house   Maybe the virtual currency in the game can link to Blockfolio Raydium somehow so that increases in ones crypto portfolio could be represented in the game to purchase items build an avatar world  Somehow the Raydium farming staking process could be accessed represented virtually in the game as well rather than through the traditional interface  I m not sure how this would be profitable for y all but maybe there is a way Look forward 80 right now and     for     SOLANA long term smile      with

wait 6 month Thanks for this  I just started staking solana on solflare this week and was very unhappy when my staking account didn t show up when I logged in today  Is this a common issue  Should I look at an alternative to solflare Wikipedia and your confirmation bias can get stuffed  And your insults  Not entertaining you anymore  You provided evidence for Falcon 9 but neglected to research other rocket projects   crashes  Go suck Elon s dick What does this mean It does thank you Its all good though with the chain  went on block explorer to make sure my staking account was still staked and everything seems good  There needs to be a competitor to solflare as far as staking goes lol I have no idea what I m doing yet but there s no way to yield farm or stake via Blockfolio right ADA IS SLOW AS F PERIOD Haha I ll just have to read more    just started learning about yield farming today    I m a noob Did you not read this post orrr Lol you can predict apparently   saying that OP can t  Why would price be what you care about if you re saying what matters is the tech Wow  great breakdown    thanks what if you can have scability  security and eco friendly protcol   visit  www rubix

the same in the beginning of trying to make it    First of all you need some SOL  not much somewhere 0 0002   I buyed mine on another exchange and then transferred it to my Solong Wallet   There I first minted a Token and when clicking accept you have to wait a little while until a screen pops up with your Mint address etc    then I copied my mint address and went back and clicked Add Token and pressed the plus     sign and paste there the copied address   Then go back and click again Mint Token and click Mint To   In Mint To you have the Receiver that you can click in small letters standing  Transfer to My SPL Account    In Amount you fill in how much tokens you would like to have   Check it out and let me know how it went    The only thing I have is that when I have created my Token and its name changes then after I Mint To it   But I think it is not a big problem   hope so If it goes back down to 40 I ll be the happiest man alive I hope this helps  https   stakingfac medium com how

attempt to It ll be back  Just wait I would have invested money into this crypto if Kraken offered it  Fricken kraken man  I m not prepared to join another crypto exchange right now but it looks like I have to look at others because they don t offer enough cryptos Nope  if you re in big now  you may have enough to live off the staking rewards once SOL is in the TOP 5 Keep stacking bros Seriously I can send you 20 bucks  Just buy some more and check back in a year I guess it s down  Cant see my wallet too  The solflare site isn t responsive either Polygon is a side chain though  not a layer 2  You can argue that layer 2s are good for eth but a side chain like polygon might just be vampire attacking liquidity from eth i will stop buying at  4500 00 Not sure about the specifics  sorry My price target is 280 EOY  still probably won t sell Stated buying at 13  Mine ETH on my computer and transfer to SOL when I hit a payout  Also but more each time I get paid  Full TRUSS in SOL What is the yield ow wow ahem nobody take more than 10  profits until we take ethereum You love to see that   All of your rewards up to the point of the slashing or just your rewards for that epoch in which you get slashed The loss would only apply to your rewards   not to your actual stack Beginning to think if an exit strategy is ever going to be wise until retirement on this coin Once  slashing  is implemented  not sure when that will be  there will be some risk of loss of your SOL if the validator you delegate your SOL to tries to attack the network   But for now  no risk You re good  it s at 55 50 rn I would like to try but fees to swap from eth to sol are to high  How do I swap from binance to SOL Only when SOL is doing the same workload ETH will be worth those lofty valuations  The question is will the DPOS be capable of handling that level of traffic Serum dex If the gas fees are  zero   very few are using the chain for activities Reading through this thread  its obvious why the ETH Tx and gas fee s are high due to demand of use when swaps don t rely on CEX s  DeFi such as uniswap and the likes remove 90  of the headaches discussed here hey doc  you using the whole fist back there Jokes on you   I bought at 47 I was lucky I got into it yesterday and this morning  HKT   The price just keep going up Definitely not late  SOL will go to top 5     1 000 lets earn together  welcome Thank you   It just completed successfully give it sometime   and the staking account will appear Explains why SOL doesn t dump that much during major sell offs  There simply isn t a lot of SOL to sell Kind of sus imo Price is basically artificially high  when those VCs sell price is gonna tank big time I m still LONG SOL  so plan to buy any dips  but  not dumb enough that I won t exit my position when it hits some aths  like today transaction fee is so cheap so everyone can start play with small amount and learn how to use solana and defi nft  dex More like Stake SOL Lambos soon That could bring enormous financial freedom to me and my love ones  I like sharing Hold the line fellas  hold the line I am  Looks good so far  It s still new  so not without smart contract risk Yes  I can see you really don t know   Btw I m Sol maxi  and non of my word claim  Solana SHOULD be an L2 solution   and you clearly don t understand what  just out of curious  means too nobody take profits till we take ethereum Summer is looking good Polygon is actually solving these gas fees and scaling issues  Currently 4 mln transactions per day  see how that compares to Solana Ethereum is not the best L1 in crypto from a pure tech point of view  but it has the largest ecosystem  If you don t know about L2 solutions you haven t DYOR   Adoption is the endgame  and there is a lot of value in L2 that solve L1 problems  So the question was totally sensible I hold Solana  Polygon and ETH Someone here is in RAY aswell   What are your thoughts It s because Solana is fucking amazing  I discover a few days ago  and the tech  I don t care the financial aspect much  But the tech  ho boi Hold sol Thank you  PM_PICS_OF_DOG  for voting on SpunkyDred This bot wants to find the best and

Solana and Serum  You want to have your sollet wallet setup with some solana in it and then you want to swap Solana for RAY  From there you can go to the staking tab and stake your ray in the pool I really don t know why people think that innovative blockchain like Solana  or any other blockchain  should be an L2 solution or Ethereum Why not Ethereum becomes an L32 or L3 for Solana Solana is killing it compared to Ethereum  you can t be an L2 solution for something that is actually so bad like Ethereum right now Crypto community should get over the fact that Ethereum is the only good alternative out there  well it s not  it s so slow  amp  cost loads of money to make transactions  gas fees Binance Smart Chain transaction latency is 75 sec lol Solana beyond underpriced right now  I am waiting for those  1 000 figures  That s where Solana will be  Right up there with ETH Put some in raydium its so good TPS is Transactions per second and Solana is one of the best  able to deal with busy networks meaning faster confirmations and lower fees  I think  Diatery is getting confused with the larger storage capacities which are measured in Terriers hence TerrierBytes uniswap and pancakeswap are the gateways for the  doge and  shib token crazes  and those networks are slower   so im saying when will Ray be selling fad dog tokens at the speed of solanaWOOF Let s go to 60 00 peeps Thank you  So a block verified N transactions  and TPS is blocks second   txs block I sont understand comment sorry terriers per second Is there a GitHub page Tps LETS GO SOLDIERS when dog coins at 50 000 tps Been a big fan of your vids for a while  Glad to see you re a redditor PUMP THAT BITCH FUCK BITCOIN Useless slow garbage  SOL is the future What does staking Mean  Is it interest like a bank Interesting question  Also would like to know this    additional utility for solana would not be a bad thing at all Wow the difference one month makes   Since I posted the above  I re branded as

wallet not risky at all  stays in u walet and auto re inves wnr Uphold has it also How do I stake  And how much do I get Where can raydium be found  Cheers  sorry for being a noob in POS Dual farming is the same consensus as PoS you stake your token and get two types back from a LP  It gets super complicated doing this sort of stuff but just plain staking RAY on Raydium is easy and 42    although think we just dropped to 22 I m getting 10 41  APY  I found Exodus much easier to use than SolFlare and my Ledger device  Not sure what the risk is  Been staking for 21 days now  So far  so good gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them is it really apples to oranges tho  they re trying to do the same thing Meanwhile over 60  of circulating supply is staked so those investors seem to be diamond handing through a 20x rip up after the January unlock Liquidity providing is entirely based around the premise of backstopping a project  token investment  against failure  submitting valuable

it too fast  cuz I still wanna buy more Best birthday gift you ll give yourself Binance smart chain is pretty much centralized  It s a proof of authority chain  Meaning that you have to be an approved validator to participate in block production   consensus  And if I m not mistaken all validator are binance validator In short when using binance smart chain you completely have to trust binance to do the right things  It the end it could be a simple server instead of blockain it would achieve the same Yes they come out as 10  as they should  What I m citing here includes inflation  which means the value you re getting back is not worth 10   more like 4 5   It s the same idea behind the government printing a bunch of money and value going down because growing demand   growing supply  Solana has a predictable inflation schedule which strips away the uncertainty you get with US Dollars or other currencies issued by central banks Also  happy cake day Thank you  tjvick  for voting on

shake it off and hit an ATH the next day I feel that alot of new retail investors don t see the benefit of BTC  Why risk your stacks if you don t even think you will make a 2x I have been calculating

to rack up much more You had me until the 3x 5x shit  Let s be honest  no one can predict that  What we can say is that Solana has the best tech  and the more people see that  the more likely adoption is  and the more valuable it is  That s all anyone can honestly say You re asking the wrong questions my dude  Solana is not a pump and dump  It is meant to be a long lasting infrastructure for the new internet  People are here because they respect the tech  not because they saw it on r cryptomoonshots The old mantra of  when btc dumps  the alts follow  seems to slowly becoming undone Great analysis   seems like an elite alt chain and therefore a good asset to consider Happy Birthday  Is sol a good buy Wen Solana banana Can t blame you   This is an elite alt chain So I m new to crypto

it to an independent node  yes  If you buy a lot and decide to create your own validator node  Even better I m also all in   Feels good to be all in on a project that actually has substance and

and happy birthday What  APY is 10 1  on Binance Happy ATH bday What is the deal with Matic  Is it huge competition for Solana Based on nothing really  We are just in the start line  I do not know where it will go but if development team continues to work and does not lose the motivation  it can beat Ethereum How did you buy   US Very cool  best of luck  Would love to hear about learnings on deploying on Solana after launch  Looking to do the same What  All you want is a new all time high for your birthday   amp  x200B Say no more Sounds like u aint staking You cry about 20 My favorite project in my portfolio  Happy birthday I was watching a video last night and the guy mentioned the news from some days ago that 7000 developers have participated in Solana hackathon and he mentioned that only happened to Ethereum and only when it reached its majority  Such an interest from developers has good reasons such as very high tps  very low transaction fee and proof of history All of these mean Solana will grow exponentially because every day more and more projects will be built based on it and they all need SOL token  So my prediction is   300 350 by the end of 2021  1500 2000 by the end of 2022  5000 by the end of 2023I have to mention that this doesn t mean Solana must eat the market cap of all the other coins  Every day more money is coming into crypto market and if does projects that I was talking about have real world use case they will bring even more money into crypto and Solana too Do you by chance have any good educational sources that you can recommend I would love to learn more about it before taking the risk Absolutely  My question to you  sincere  is that if those insiders decide to cash out and nuke sol back down to  10  amp  all that sol changes hands to people like me who want a piece of the network  would that increase decentralization Stake and hodl Why can I claim airdrop tokens for free and send them to my binance wallet it s pretty weird Exactly the problem  Ethereum works only if doesn t have any killer apps  That s mad We will see    August September Blockfolio is totally trustworthy  I use them frequently to buy  sell and withdraw Who know for real   All only is dreaming to diamond   hand   We    SOLANA STRONG and good projects fly    to the     rocket learn to trade   profit is profit   the more you trade the more you will do trades like this   if your goal was 40 then congrats HODL till Jesus comes back thousands aire status lol You made a good profit  I did the same thing on NEO  It went crazy right after I sold  Just move on to the next project  Not sure I would go back to Solana  Once you are emotionally invested in a project  it s time to move on  It s not a good setup  Just look at what you might have misread for next time Buy back in  Solana going to  250 USD in this market  Longer term than that  it someday matches the current size of the ETH market  while ETH goes 3 5X further  and is likely priced around  1500 per SOL Hard to imagine it stronger than MATIC as an ETH L2  I hold both and love both  but they re ultimately separate visions BuyMore Sol You made  10 profit  Good job  No reason to die over missing out on  20 Buy back in Solana can easily become a top 5 coin  Severely undervalued in comparison to ADA and DOT 1 year   100  2 years   200  3 years   400  4 years   450  5 years

selling anytime soon Happy birthday TO THE SOL I second this Let s fucking go I didn t think it would hit this today  I thought BTC Woukd of held it down  Feeling pretty confident we might hit 250 this cycle  However I ain t selling  I believe in Solana Wow ho capital gain with compound interest coinbase listing inc    defo not too l8 Bears have gone extinct from the market that probably means it isn t actually staking   First you create an account and send the amount you want to stake   Then you  delegate  that account to a validator to stake your coins     I m guessing the unstaking process is the opposite  you  undelegate  your account from the validator then you can send your funds from the staking account back to your wallet and remove your staking account   check out   https   solana com staking removetokensstake i second this motion In what time frame do you see a 3x 5x  and does a longer time frame see further gains or is there a reason for the   250 ceiling   Why do you feel solana is doing so well when ETH and BTC are flat or dropping  and should we expect that Solana should usually run counter to the big boys Damn it  I was going to buy a bunch more in a couple days SAM NOT FUCKING AROUND Trade eth for usdt then buy sol with usdt To be honest I can t find an undelegate button    only delegate button  There is a remove account button but that s not clear to me as there is no explanation What about the bear market no prob Very comprehensive and informative  Thank you for this Was I an idiot for buying cake and uni  Everyone is complaining about their exchanges now I just bought  so you can be sure a dip is coming It s unchartered territory who could say really marking this for future kids I love them  I put my social and drivers license in to get verified  100  trustworthy did you figure it out   I believe there is an  undelegate  button Started watching SOL at around 13 and wanted to buy but didn t for some stupid reason  Forgot about it and now here I am  Just bought my first bag  ‍ ️ I love reading this as a command instead of a statement hAhahah Solana only buy and stake   Scaling ranking go to the top 5 in the next future Blockfolio is owned by FTX  IMO they are the most trustworthy exchange in the business  They are legitimately changing the game The one remaining issue I see with sidechains like Polygon is the onbaording gas fees This is huge and I think still totally underappreciated by the wider crypto community  You basically have to be a whale to use DeFi on Ethereum This guy cryptos Thanks for the input  That is quite helpful for understanding Based on https   www reddit com r kucoin comments nfdud0 solana _kucoin _where _are _we _on _being _able _to _add Think 45 is the new floor  Gonna be following closely this week to get those tasty dips 1 year  1502 years  4003 years  10004 years  28005 years  4500 Yes  as of today  52 is in Solana s hands   The SOL token distribution is as follows  16 23  went towards an initial seed sale  12 92  of tokens were dedicated to a founding sale  12 79  of SOL coins were distributed among team members and 10 46  of tokens were given to the Solana Foundation  The remaining tokens were already released for public and private sales or are still to be released to the market  So for today when you check Circulating Supply	272 637 428 SOL  Total Supply	494 519 162 SOL amp  x200B 55  is in circulation  I cannot predict the price if it hits to 100   there should be a model but given the technology and infrastructure I read  I am not shaken or bearish or worried Thank you I m not sure what you mean  but check out https   solanabeach io   Maybe this will help you or give you some insights Lol purple n green xD I think the block size is pretty dynamic  but there is a target for how many transactions should be in one block  In Solana there is the concept of  slots  https   docs solana com terminology slot   which is the time during which a leader produces a block  and there is the variable  default _target _signatures _per _slot  https   docs rs solana sdk 1 6 9 solana_sdk fee_calculator constant DEFAULT_TARGET_SIGNATURES_PER_SLOT html   where signatures refers to transaction signatures  This value is 20 000  and combined with  default _ms _per _slot  https   docs rs solana sdk 1 6 9 solana_sdk clock constant DEFAULT_MS_PER_SLOT html   400  we get 20 000tx 0 4s   50 000tx s as the target tps of the network  I suppose any requested transactions below this rate will cause lower  transaction fees  https   docs solana com implemented proposals transaction fees fee parameters  and maybe shorter slot times Havent been at it a year yet  but yea  percentage is sweet   but i does depend on prices moves of course Bought a lot at 1 35 bought at  13   sold today  Will buy back in  anything under  50 is a steal 500bn in 5 years  no joke Can we find that interview sequence This is the type of app I have been waiting for  Hope they succeed Man I do not know what that means but I am intrigued   I bought some solana on ftx us and it makes me nervous that I m not properly managing it gt Scalability of solana has no theoretical tps limitGiven that the speed of light is capped  I would think there is a theoretical limit   The whitepaper  https   solana com solana whitepaper pdf  mentions a maximum transaction rate of 710k tps on a 1 Gigabit network  This is under absolutely perfect conditions though Time to dive in as well then Solana Ecosystem NewsA look into the growing number of projects building on Solana  This post will be updated on a bi weekly basis with the latest news     There are now over 250 projects in the Solana ecosystem and counting  The Solana Foundation will be releasing a bi weekly ecosystem update highlighting the vast array of projects using the Solana blockchain  Among these projects include unique wallet solutions  decentralized exchanges  lending protocols  staking platforms  digital games  storage solutions  metaverse platforms and much more     The Solana ecosystem continues to grow stronger each day and we want to ensure the community gets notified of all the new projects entering the

vyWra3ns Please improve the serum staking UI     Welcome to the community  looking forward to seeing some bad ass UIs Break the wheel How do you stake SOL Welcome  That s a very good summary of the solana blockchain  Just a couple things 1  Scalability of solana has no theoretical tps limit as far as I know  as hardware speeds increase  Moores law  so will the TPS  I envision millions of TPS on the solana blockchain in the future  as I believe they  along with serum  will compete with Nasdaq and other exchanges 2  Sam Bankman Fried Thats one key thing is it just one insider  3  10 etc  that own those tokens  If its spread out then its fine not great but fine  If its just a few then yeah I d pay attention to charts Careful of the misleading apy number  Supply schedule is at about 6  right now so real apy is about 4 5  like a lot of other major coins including ADA Thanks for clarify Yall buying at over 40  I feel like an old man buying at 32 xD You ve posted this before  but a lot of those various sales were contracted SAFT sales with their financing partners that even had limited downside right now just instagram  but we will have a twitter by the end of the month  We will also be announcing our official discord and telegram by the end of the week Oh I mean percentage yield you would earn per year     is that the same as the APR  It just looks really high so I m confused we will be announcing an official telegram and discord soon This is an important point  Clearly they believe in the project over the long term  and that s a great sign  BUT A  supply and demand means price is only a reflection of liquidity  and then when it increases significantly  price will fall  And B  by staking  they are also earning a huge amount of the newly distributed Solana as well  Which inherently limits decentralization as well Lol I have been buying dips but thing never drops under 40  which is good plus who wants to sell great apy without having to leave on exchange Open your sol tab  Click top right icon for earn rewards  The rest is pretty intuive  I ve heard you should keep a small amount unstaked for fees What s with the FUD sir Both every L1 is an L2  and all the L2 s  outside of full recursive zero knowledge proofs  take some sort of custody risk  including optimistic rollups   The correct way to think of them is  decentralized custody  All these tokens on serum   https   dex projectserum com   market C1EuT9VokAKLiW7i2ASnZUvxDoKuKkCpDDeNxAptuNe4  https   dex projectserum com   market C1EuT9VokAKLiW7i2ASnZUvxDoKuKkCpDDeNxAptuNe4 have been bridged over from eth btc   So Solana already has overlapping features to all the other L2s out there   If recursive ZKPs are possible  then solana can be rolled into ethereum and ethereum can be rolled into solana   Every blockchain s blockspace is fungible and I believe the most important features will be censorship resistance and latency Make sure you have a little Sol in your wallet for transaction fees   also if you re using sollet you may need to hit the approve button on the pop up window that stays open in the backround Actually  I d really like it s price to decrease to add more SOL  Not gonna sell a single coin until the market shows signs going bearish You hold ETH on binance  Just sell the ETH and buy SOL 3 days of re buying at 47 48 50staking and yield farming until the sun goes down I hold Solana COPE  STEP  RAY and MEDIA atm Love the concept  No gas minting would solve for one of the highest entry barriers for most artists to be able to start selling their work minting costs  in the case of NFTs  which is the equivalent to materials and framing costs in the case of physical work  Excited to see what you re building here I only have 1 25 SOL which I bought from a  20 Christmas gift from an aunt   16 because of the Binance staking contest  I knew nothing about Solana yet back then but I just trusted Binance LOL  I m hodling  til 10 yrs  from now Being a poor student it ll be while before I can add more SOL but I sure will FTX US Anyone having trouble swapping tokens on Raydium     Mine Says  making transaction  but nothing happens Polygon is killing it as an L2 for Ethereum  It would be hard to do any better  One of the reasons why Solana is exciting is that it runs L2 like performance on L1  No complicated on boarding  chain migration  process

whale who didn t get to buy Solana in January having a fucking cow and thrashing the entire market cap by a paltry 500 million so that the price of Solana can come down to 40 bucks for him momentarilyPeter  chill out bro Well that s a fuzzy timeline Some of my favourites also Why 43 now  time for you to buy back thx bro love you Your USDC are ERC20  so it will cost you the ETH gas  as priced right now   it s a mandatory step unfortunately  then it will be minted as SPL in Solana  in your USDC SPL address Will the transaction cost lessened if I use that bridge  Or it will be the same It s called  volatility  Crypto is volatile  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk Fucking bitcoin Probably panic selling and automatic stop losses setting everything on fire I like stable coin ray farming Due to liquidity I m loving the emphasis on helping development and growth on the network  How do teams apply Raydium Remind me in one day Zcash and Mina Protocol already use them Time to get low price   And hodl forever Solana will continue dropping like the others  It will most likely reach 40  I sold at 55 and planning on buying back when it hits around 43 Losers sold    Not a loser This aged poorly  I think you re right  eventually Go ahead  amp  contact Binance support about that  they arr the one responsible for that SOL wallet  they have its keys  they are the only one able to help you out AFAIK you can t  TrustWallet don t offer that luxury of converting ERC20 to SPL just like that  There is one solution is to send those USDC though Sollet wormhole bridge  which will cost you ETH GAs in the process Awesome news Bought the dip when it flashcrashed to 44 the morning  Sol and Polygon are pretty much the only 2 strong cryptos which are holding up Imagine if it hold up so well in bearish divergence what will happen when we recover  I think the 100   SOL MOONSHOT is imminent and he panicsold it on 0 40 and put the money into Shiba Inu for the next  1000x   D wat fuck this piece of shit  either restore the cryptomarket as it was 2 weeks ago or compensate us for our losses right f now but I think everyone should buy  gold  when there is this kind of inflation happening Lmao imagine being upset cause you missed out on the super early price for sol see below   there are smart contract projects already running on solanahttps   medium com stakin solana smart contracts overview 6cb94f02b8a4 not as decentralized as ethereum  hardware requirements are a bit more strict for solana and so there are less validators   it s a newer project so that s also partially why It s just a comparison of marketcap with cardano and polkadot  So there is a valid reasoning behind it gt Anyhow  all this is why if I had to choose one coin the top 15 right now  I would bet on Solana  and I am personally invested in it right now  for full disclosure No smart contracts Always surprised be it stocks or crypto etc the panic when it goes down If everything just stayed green all the time everybody would just put money in and do no work The economy can t work like that  the risk rewards is what differentiates these types of trades This site is scam  no presale on solstarter yet I got mine in batches total 21 5sol now  Literally in just 2 days 1st batch 6 4434   300 usd2nd batch 2 44   112 usd3rd batch 5 476   280 usd4th batch 7 146  365 usd Weight average 21 505  1057 usdWeight average purchase price per SOL   49 15 usd There s a risk to staking I ve been waiting 3 days to get verified to use my credit card  Ridiculous Imgur the trade or didnt happen shorted 69 A bot  Lol I was in ethereum at  40 and sold for far too little  Lesson learned this time with solana  I sold my holo  and a couple other alts and piled in  This ones a winner ok This is very concerning You re not a proper degen untill you get some SolAPE Pass the hopium this way sir Why would you sell it      When I said  real deal   I was thinking long term  This is one of the rare crypto coins that have it all and the price is relatively affordable  My guess is SOL will cost at least 5x or more  Comparing to investment in ETH or BTH it is hard that s  going to happen soon  plus at this moment both main cryptos are very expensive to buy When Elon discovers Solana he will be sold I read it and I didn t say 5000 will never happen  However  it won t happen 99 9  in your predicted short time span  I HODL myself a small 4digit amount of SOL  it s my fav project  and I don t even think to sell a single one within the next years The Solana team is looking for a UX designer full time I believe  Go to twitter OP went all in on Dogecoin at 67 cents Bought SOL initially on FTX  then made a Wallet on Sollet dot io  Then send SOL to the wallet  Very simple to make  Then connect wallet to Raydium and you can swap to any of the tokens there  and stake  provide liquidity etc etc I am learning myself  Learning by dive in 2021 will prolly have a higher price than 2022 also btw I don t know whether SOL would reach the estimated price but I find it to be resilient  It might most probably go between 60  80   Also Polygon went as low as 1 98 USDT  and its bullish SOL and MATIC are great investments from what I observe I think you didn t read my last paragraph    coins like Solana  cardano  Ethereum  etc are fundamentally different than Bitcoin  Bitcoin is like digital gold but these coins because of smart contract can be used as a tool in real world for almost anything that needs to be transported transferred and this means as time goes and new projects use smart contract they need to buy these coins and it means new money will be injected into the market and that will cause the market cap growth If you think this is not going to happen just look at the market cap of apple  a company with real world use case  and compare it to the Bitcoin or crypto market  People are ready to pay for something that solves their problem or make their lives easier but not everyone goes and buy gold Not sure who sold  but I bought a ton  I never thought we would see these prices again Thinking about selling my SOL right now If you sold SOL now and switched back into ETH and BTC and made a profit on them next month you would be a god I use to chase price and then I discovered SOL read the project and went all in  I just loved everything about it  I have it all staked and stake every time I get another 10 SOL  mostly through ETH mining   The price is just a bonus for me  I think it has a real future This I have a paying status whitdraw for many hours and nothing happens gt UpholdSorry  I just tried signing up on Uphold and go this for NY   Uphold is in the process of obtaining a BitLicense in the state of New York  Until the BitLicense is issued we cannot support cryptocurrency transactions in New York Stake  n  Bake I m surprised AAVE doesn t just switch  I understand it would take time to port over but by not aiming for cross chain utilization  i can only see a slow fade to irrelevancy  I d say this about any project launching in this cycle assuming the use case isn t Solana blockchain specific Added more aT 45 not selling till eth surpassed time to double down then I guess Last time Elon didn t affect Solana that much and Sol could hold its level  another sign that Solana is strong who tweeted Guess you got your  17k back since you deleted your post can t go up forever I ll take 5  on an appreciating asset when my bank gives me  01  on my savings account Too bad I bought at the top lol That s makes sense thanks for letting me know Cool didn t know about this  I m also excited about Phantom You just have to wait there are probably many people also trying to access the website  Many projects are having front end issues dealing with traffic  The same thing happened to me today I just let it load and eventually it fetched the accounts  You can easily check your wallet address on solanabeach io  amp  verify that funds are safu Solfarm is dropping a token  tulip  it could be interesting oxy is very different from ray  raydium is an amm  amp  oxygen is a borrow lending protocol in alpha version its very crude atm  still good time to stack it s a  2 80 stablecoin lol yes it should be between polkadot and cardano but price 800  with market cap more  200B is nor realistic  cardano  55B  polkadot   35B today If you need to evaluate validators based on returns  https   stakeview appBut please spread your stake  don t just stake to top APY Hmm OXY seems pretty similar to Raydium  I m a noob so don t quite understand what the difference would be I mean  I get it  You re excited about finding something great early on   We all are I think  There s nothing wrong about being excited about a payday  What I think is important to talk about even more so is the technology behind the blockchain  It really is a new level of this technology and it s going to help push EVERY crypto project forward  Super cool stuff I honestly could not tell you a good answer  but I respect the question  These are the posts that will grow Solana  Not the ones we see w the upvotes saying  Solana to  1000   w a bunch of emojis Is there anything you can add about potential drawbacks  I know there is a ton of  SOL locked up that will eventually hit the market  And the uniqueness of the consensus algorithm means that it might not be thoroughly battle tested  Idk what else to be concerned about Etherum is a better project but  this is like comparing a shark vacuum to a dyson  Which is more expensive  The Dyson  Solona has more growth potential because of the price  Solona likely will reach  150  Etherum is at  around  3000  If etherum can reach  5000 why can Solona not reach  150 or even 200 MAPS MI AMOR Can solape touch 1 Hallelulah its so nice seeing people understand the tech I know that was all my fault and I take full accountability for it  But this wasn t my fault my account got hacked and this money wasn t even all mine it was my sisters and friends money that I lost and if they find out they will kill me From Solana s websiteSolaris  DEFI  Solaris is a Lending Borrowing protocol that brings Flashloans to Solana blockchain  inspired by Aave and Compound  However  I have heard rumors another one that is supposed to be really well developed is going to come out during this hackathon You are

Rust and the quality of the team is all I needed to know  It s FAST and transactions are dirt cheap  They can process  800 per second compared to ETH s what  like 10 Brings the fun back into crypto when you can shoot around tiny bags without worrying you re going to get dinged for  30 each transfer It s doing well when BTC and ETH are dropping because whales are accumulating imo Honestly who cares about when it 3x or 5x  SOL is in it to win it and has a shot at massive upside  I m stacking lamps until further notice Wait terrier bytes wasn t a pun    hahaha that s good stuff tho And id imagine Ray price goes to 75  this market mag e Ya totally  I learn most of what I know through YouTube  But make sure to watch multiple ppl so u don t get all your info from one source If cardanskue w no product has market cap so big  surely we can Ecosystem I only asked cause you said  it s the real deal  and didn t right about the tech  or anything else  Just the price  That was the perception I got and I could totally be wrong  It s just a common mentality which I think is really unfortunate because it amounts to nothing but gambling If recursive ZKPs are possible   This is the first time I ve heard of this possibility  any rough theoretical material in this direction you can point me to  I d love to learn more That s not a very wise conclusion  lots of assumptions included without any knowledge about the situation  If you wanted to make me shallow it didn t work  I am following charts regularly  so I noticed 4 5 days ago that ETH and BTC will go down  and still going   so to save value I learned about SOL and found a coin that has good value  quantity and support  Btw   I work hard for my money and I can t afford to lose what I invested    I don t think that is something I need to explain If you are happy with the prospect you may lose 10k go for it Check out OXY  Seems like it could be a strong project with a good team Rocket fuel Great analysis  I m curious to know your time frame on the 3 5x  Is that this bull cycle  If we re looking at all the benefits solana has to offer  I don t see why it couldn t be as big as ETH and BTC in the future once more smart contracts come to the platform  This would be much greater than 5x Please less talking about price  Adoption  news and partners are the long term factors in gain market cap  Pump and dump never good things  look at ADA last week when it reached 2 4 I slapped 1 5k in at 39 I m questioning whether it s worth going the whole hog and putting 10 000 Could you expand more on Proof of History and how the algo works As someone who s lost crypto that I kept on an exchange  do yourself a massive favor and transfer it off ftx and into your own personal wallet asap So if it goes down like BTC or ETH you ll sell for the whatever s in the green glad it was helpful 800    I would die from joy https   explorer solana com tx 4D78fiU1nXrJK9iwU9hwcJcdJL2d64pM42oog6DR59tRiLatn5Ly7sA2YVSQAbsFvP2PwJxkiqzHbE2sYAS1iNru sorry  this is my transaction  can you tell me where is the txid you buy at sixty and sell at 800people wont  get  solana till they figure out that eth2 wont solve all their problems and defi 2 0 isnt ideal on L2s I believe those are coming the 23rd  I think I saw something on their Twitter feed You ll have to contact Binance since thay are the only ones repsonsible for that SOL address  amp  have its Keys  they might ask you for some FEE to solve your ticket though  Someone like you but he sent his COPE tokens to SOL address in Binance told me that Give them the TXID   Your sending address   the SOL address of binance Good question may have ur thoughts Why  What other coins did you consider before saying you are all into Solana  Are you a bot I just made a transaction to send usdc from sollet wallet to binance  but I mistakenly sent usdc to the sol wallet address on the exchange  so how can I get my usdc back Good point  One question  where do you stake  Or what are some of the best wallets for staking SOL  I m currently using Exodus  seemed like a good option  over 10  APY  Are there any better options than that Are you buying on an exchange or    exchanging in a wallet  Ray isn t on exodus Mind sharing why Probably not  This is one to hold as long as you possibly can in my opinion  Or at least only take some  like half  out if it makes you great or decent profit  then hold the rest till retirement  Who knows  you might be able to buy your own island by then lol How long you stake on exodus before you saw reward i was 3 weeks and nothing Nice post  I learned a lot  This just confirms my bias and prediction of  425 by the end of this bull run Yeah me too We just getting started with STEP let s not call it  crash    let s call it  descension Saw that  I was just being sarcastic due to its quick bounce That s usual crypto  Look at history and you will know The risk is high but so are the rewards in crypto  After a couple of these cycles  you become OG I am buying   ‍ ️ Yes  it dropped to 26 5 today but recovered very fast Move to New Jersey lol There s no reason really  People think it will drop  so it s dropping  That s all there s to it  Unless you re a day trader  the thing that matters is the tech If you believe that blockchains and DeFi will revolutionize finance and the internet during the next decade  then it literally doesn t matter what the price is today There s no reason really  People think it will drop  so it s dropping  That s all there s to it  Unless you re a day trader  the thing that matters is the tech If you believe that blockchains and DeFi will revolutionize finance and the internet during the next decade  then it literally doesn t matter what the price is today You were not around it seems when Bitcoin lost 90   value and it happened more than once  So its not even close to being the worst crash Try Blockfolio or Uphold  both have Solana listed This  I m still not sure why anyone should be freaking out  Buy more SOLANA crashed Yep  it may not happen but it is very likely  So take some money out now if you are too afraid to lose it Excellent video  I really enjoyed it  Well reasoned and I learned things  It made me even more bullish on Sol for the long haul   I m looking for your channel on YouTube now https   t me solana Thanks but I can t use that in NY This is what I was told to do before and didn t remember  Thank you so much  Will try it this time since I ve been Sol less far too long lol Can I ask will I lose a lot in fees trading on serum then swapping on raydium  Will I be told the fees in advance  I m not that familiar with swaps and most seem to be on ETH so all I hear about is the crazy fees Well  as much as you may be right crypto may very well be a market in isolation  If it isn t that speaks to how mainstream it has become Stop with the FUD Thanks but I installed that wallet a while back and NY residents can t do much on it  No exchange Looks interesting  Thanks This why we all need to  DYOR  Do your own Research Great video I got absolutely wrecked in a margin trade  Why oh why update  I bought in on margin after the first small dip and before the large dip  I got liquidated and lost everything Can you use FTX US in NY  That d be the best way to buy It s not over  It will probably crash again soon Buy btc send it to a sollet wallet  amp  trade it on serum for usdc  Swap that for sol on raydium What about when bull run ends  wont be this coin like  10 till next bullrun  2023   2024 Perhaps you wanna check this out http   boards 4channel org biz thread 35710754 hey guys insider here for those of you that are If you have COPE staked do you still get airdrops  Or does it have to be in your wallet Worst crash by dollar amount but not by percentage Yeah this is going down further  The economic markets are going to crash too  This is most likely a depression we are heading towards  Historically recessions can last years U have to accept it on the tab you wallet is on I noticed the same thing on my sollet wallet when I got the step LP token   but I had no problem staking it on solfarm I just pooled it on raydium Everything is dropping now because it went up so fast  This is normal market behavior I wouldn t call it a bear market unless the price keeps bleeding like this for a few months  but I don t personally believe it will Thank you  Yes I do it for other projects but it takes like 8 10 hours to research so I can t do it too often or else the quality suffers haha I use Exodus Wallet  staking for 10 40  APY If this is anything like 2017  who knows   we might be in for a year or more of this until the market bottoms  Eventually the bull market will return and Hodlers could be on for serious gains Bought I see you have bought into my investment process  Working wonders for me I have extra cash remaining and refused to buy more at the dip  I will only buy at  58 or above Me too but it worked out with this plunge And if you re holding strong  consider holding on an exchange that pays interest  to grow you re bags in the meantime   amp  x200B Exodus pays 10  APY on SOL  Bigger bags are going to mean exponential gains when the prices start to fly  amp  x200B If you re curious about interest rates on any other coins you may be holding  check out  This Spreadsheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y edit usp sharing  that I put together  It compares interest rates on 130  coins across 15 platforms to help you find the best rate for any particular coin you may be holding It s going to dip again    those guys with the charts  who draw triangles and talk of Wyckoff events and Markdown accumulation cycles have insisted it will dip again This was a great video  It s nearly impossible to find something that 1  doesn t just focus on price movement of the token and 2  is willing to discuss the accolades and critiques of a project in a fair way  I thought you did a phenomenal job in that regard and really presented everything in an objective way which I really  really appreciate  Do you do videos like this for other projects I would look into  cope I posted your question in SolFlare already  but no response or answer yet  they are having problems with their RPC  from what i understood  This is my post into their Telegram Group   https   t me SolFlare _Wallet 6866  https   t me SolFlare_Wallet 6866  Imgur  https   imgur com Zn9pIQa Hodling    till Jesus comes backAin t no spaghetti fingys over here From whats happening on the exchanges  a shit load of whales in ETH and BTC deposited their coins for selling  A bunch of exchanges had to shut down for a while I sat today on the bench and watched in horror as my stacked portfolio s value evaporated     only to rebound in a matter of minutes   I ve got staked 150 SOL acquired at an avg  price of 43 62070 ADA acquired at an avg  price of 1 415100 ATOM acquired at an avg  price of 25I m happy to HODL SOLnas long as it takes and in the meantime achieve a respectable yield Will probably sell ATOM and ADA at some point in future Cheers guys This sounds great for a LTI Not at all  SOL holding pretty well If you re holding your SOL for the long term  don t miss out on passive  exponential gains by holding on an exchange that pays interest  I put together  This Spreadsheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y edit usp sharing  that compares interest rates of 130  coins across 15 platforms to help you find the best rates for the coins you re holding  To save you some reading  Exodus pays the highest rate on SOL that I ve come across  10  APY  This boost to your holdings  plus the rocket that SOL is building are going to multiply your gains exponentially I had slow hands but im back in    39 The market always comes back    in at  39 I have got the same problem    Everything worked well last week    Today I get this error    I tried solflare  raydium  serum etc  everywhere the same errors dreams do come true I m not sure catapult is quite extreme enough for this crash   I bought more though I use apeboard to track the invest Nah it s fine ur good Bought more at  36  Looks like I m on tinned beans until payday now  but it was worth it In any case  buy more Would be so dope if they had an interface link with Blockfolio where you could stake farm  Could have your whole portfolio in one place and then see inbound yields Would be nice if there was a daily thread on this subreddit No way I m selling Exactly    Solana is actual being used at this moment Nice  Love it  Can the platform evolve  Multichain Didn t meant to sound harsh Smh after I get in I m moving on from Solflare You d still be free to build something for India  Check out chain link or listen to Anatoly s podcast with Sergey Nazarov Honestly I don t know what the mandate of the country specific grants are  but if crypto is going to go mainstream and expand the sorts of real world use cases it addresses  aspects of it will need to be regulatory compliant  locally promoted  tying into country specific oracle networks and utilizing aspects of the legal frameworks that are highly country specific MAPS for instance  if executed well  really could replace airbnb and probably Uber without the middle men  but without addressing tax compliance on a country by county basis I think the regulators will make it illegal  Just my uninformed 2c  Exciting world though  Solana actually seems like it can do what Ethereum promised 6yrs ago and start solving more use cases than just defi and speculation Mate relax  the OP is new  Doesn t hurt to help out one another now does it Wish I had the answer  I m in the same boat I mean you probably wouldn t have said that BTC would be 60k back when it was 7  Or maybe when eth was 65 80  all year back then  that it would 2 years later hit judt about this 5k  And that s with those fundamentals under those marketsWhat makes sol so unique and possible  is it s laser cheap fees  Limitless potential   and in the rifht now as of today market which more and more people every secondI mGoin w OP prediction on this one  Sol can withstand snthrjnf I think Raydium will become 100  a coin  FAST  Multiple factors here  1  The name is lit af  ok not a real point hehe 2  The function is ine we are familiar with  uniswap pancake etc 3  raydium is too sauce      Literally  this has been the least technical explanation of my no financial advice beleifa but it s gonna be a big one   judt like all solana projects    A few bucks rn  will be hundreds in blink of an eye I just assume that something better will come along   Nothing is going to be cutting edge technology forever Solana forwver This Indeed  I think its  retracing  a bit lol There is no automated slashing right now  but it is planned  I guess currently the governance authority handling such issues are the Solana developers https   www reddit com r solana comments lyu8fi wait _theres _no _slashing _right _now What I would imagine happening is that as soon as more than 2 3 of validator stake votes on invalid blocks  double spends   the remaining 1 3 would notice and ring the alarms  But I am not sure how the network would proceed  The 2 3 use modified node versions so they can basically not be considered part of the network  However they have access to stake accounts with 2 3 of all stake  I guess they get slashed It s a historic flash crash  Don t worry  it was needed  The market was way overvalued the past couple of months so now we corrected and we ll steadily increase  All good  In a year from now we ll be looking back and laughing with this What s the point of these country specific grants  Isn t the purpose of crypto to be location agnostic  What if I m from Ukraine but want to build something really valuable for Indian CoinDCX Couldnt buy with my card on Binance due to lag  Luckily I had pending orders that average to about  38 as the entry Welcome to the club gt 500   Billion  Fixed Also  imagine a scenario where that asshole Tethered it all and is now ready to dump it all in Solana China banned crypto and Elon  We finally got the crash    I m still holding but I ve been waiting for this correction for MONTHS  Great prices again  May take a year or so now before we enter another bull market bitcoin  Its just bitcoin  Bitcoin was terribly overvalued and dropped This is the end      HoDL your breath and count to ten only thing i sold this week is tsla  i m with the sol gang for at least 1 2 years Time to buy the dip I saw the lowest on Binance was 26 5    What a chance Something triggered a big dip    possibly a huge sell of bitcoin or whatever  and now people are just panic selling and alot of stop losses are being triggered too Showing  32 on ftx  holy shit Ftx us dude  It s great Worst crash of crypto market history Um   surely I can t be the only one who was around in 2017  Lol Go to FTX How do they get away with saying 10 4   What s their justfication Started with Elon and continued with Chinese banks  new regulations on crypto same   i can t tell the rewards earned on  staking SOL Good luck for you     We    SOLANA STRONG Get back to work  Make me some money  Thanks

decentralization  Their lack of slashing does I dont think its ture that developers dont know rust  Quite the contrary devs love it  My hardcore CS friends talk about it all the time  It has been consistently voted on github as the most liked language of the year since 2016  In fact I read from github stats that there are 10 times more rust developers compared to solidity 2017 crash from 20k to 3k was worse  2011 crash from 29  to 2  was worse2012 crash from 1200  to 260 amp  was savage too But early US stock market was also very volatile and also had its fair share of catastrophic crashes  Hope nobody SOLd 7 80  currently Ftx has been working well for me I plan to hold sol for a few years so price doesnt bother me atm  I was pissed I couldn t buy the dip due to exchanges being

again for the info Never heard of safepal I ll look into it  Thanks I just went to FTX earlier today and it says not available in my country  I assume it meant state  I don t want to use VPN and fake location cause I worry I won t have it on one day and be blocked or with Binance they give you 2 days to withdraw everything Same with exodus I had the wallet on my desktop months ago and then everything was not available to me  I m not sure how you re in NYC and using either Not available in NY  It truly sucks living here and wanting to invest in crypto without jumping thru hoops Working from my dorm room for the past year  I managed to get this awesome team and we re launching our blockchain project MOGUL Coin on the 14th of June  ICO starts in 4 weeks  I am very excited and I m hoping my great team will see their hard work pay off  you can participate in our efforts by taking part in the airdrop on our website where you ll get 40 000 MGUL tokens  I m also more than happy to chat to you personally  you can find me on telegram   filipmo  fingers crossed   find us at mogulcoin io I use both FTX and Expdus in NYC you have to buy eth or bc  Coinbase and transfer to exodus then exchange that for sol No no no  It s a  sale I think what Exodus is doing is they add your profit twice a week and you also get profit on your profit and this is how they reach 10 what about Binance US Also congratulations to those who tried to sell but encountered trading difficulties The dips are made for buying  But keep in mind that the market is still fragile so we can t be sure if we ll have another major dip or a bull run  The world is crazy at the moment  There s a lot of talk about the upcoming financial crisis in the USA that could very well affect crypto as well  If you want to be truly objective and mature investor  you have to ask yourself if crypto will someday become the main currency of the world  If it will happen and you keep holding  it doesn t matter if its value is dumping or pumping against the dollar  What matter is how much crypto you ll have by then 70  sol 30  eth  my bag is      seltzershark      Commands   opt out    delete My bag is 70  SOL 30  ETH Binance So Earthing On exodus  Ada and Algorand clearly tell and show the rewards but Solana doesn t Depends on how much you want to pay attention  I believe we may be in for quite a long correction now  bear market   so you could dollar cost average in on the way to bring your average price down  or you could wait a bit and see how we shake out  Solana is at least 3 year hold for me  so I m not selling  but I ll be watching the chart to see when btc breaks the downtrend  and the market begins to consolidate again before I buy A bit worrying to see the comments  that s just crypto   it s normal   it s volatile   No  There was a major news  China re iterated a law that they passed regarding crypto trading and holding of crypto currencies  Given Chinese investors are huge in crypto this was the catalyst for a mass sell off  Markets were toppy after weeks of rallying  people with margin accounts were forced to shut positions further escalating the down move  There was a catalyst  and the market suffered as a result  On the bright side  this was a one off event  The question is  will the fed print more money and support other markets  Fear of inflations are hurting tech stocks and by osmosis crypto markets  We will go back if the Nasdaq bounces back  There is also a question of value  it s funny to have everyone jumping and shouting this is the future  But look at ICP   what is basically a startup project with no proof of concept raising  40bn in a day  That is scary and signs of an over heated market  SOL is strong though and trading at acceptable levels  Buy more  Unless that Polygon matic addressed ETH s problems in which case SOL will lose some of its lustre and it will take longer to be adopted by others I like this one Do you think it would be best to buy now that the prices are so low Would you recommend buying now that the prices are so low Where is it staked 8 12  is still pretty sweet Exodus does not pay 10  APY on SOL  they are misrepresenting their returns Actual returns for Exodus  which stakes your SOL with Everstake  is here https   stakeview app Looking at the  All  chart which is an average over the past 36 days  Everstake earns 8 12 Use safepal Go into the  exchange  section and you can buy SOL with busd etc  No KYC Quick question my sol is staked but doesn t seem to get any rewards  does it take that much time for sol  Been 2 month already I will never sell my  SOL  ️ Anti Mooning I m gonna call it an  upside down ascension Hey  there won t be any noticeable fees when swapping  that s why Solana is so popular  fast and cheap   You ll be hit with fees when you transfer the btc over though  You place the order yourself like a centralized exchange  like if you bought on etrade or robinhood   so you can see exactly what you are trading away for My guess is 3000 by 2025  which gives me plenty of time to pump enough money into it paying my retirement I am new to Solana  I want to ask  who are the best to follow about solana  And which exchange to buy it  Thank you If you got through this  you can probably get through anything  If you re smart and playing the long game  which you probably are if you re commenting on this   consider the addition of earning interest to your long term strategy  A lot of exchanges pay compound interest in the same coin that you re holding  just for holding it on their platform allowing you to earn exponential  passive gains Quick Tip  Exodus pays 10  APY on SOL amp  x200B If you re interested in earning interest on other coins  check out  This Spreadsheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y edit usp sharing  I made that compares interest rates of 140  coins paid by 15 different platforms to find the best rates for the particular coins you re holding The projects on solana I actively endorse and hold are very few I like rope volatility index market  orca the only dex i actually like on solana  Raydium nice but mehh Holding this just for its popularity I remember  I also remember the early days when it crashed to literally pennies Was able to grab a few SOL  30  about to lower my avg a bit so that was nice lol did anyone have time to sell buy the dip It s times like this I wish I d waited one more day  This correction is big Scratch that  it s all still plummeting  Good time to hold or get in incrementally and average down Lol it s not bad  It was a hard correction  yes  but Solana just traded sideways  Anyway  it s still a great time to buy since cryptocurrency like Bitcoin is plummeting to the earth To be just a third of ethereum which is where I would place Solana that s x10 current price so    around  400  If Solana continues to be adopted and more projects are placed on Solana   half of ethereum   x15 price that s  600 but in an exuberant market   yeah I can see  800  Well I bought 1k worth at  40  Cmonnnn Solana I sold my BTC and ETH ETFs yesterday  with the intention of transferring the money to SOL  takes a couple days to settle    Accidentally side stepped today s losses I m laughing at this because I wanted to buy Solana for the first time but I have a rule never to buy at peak   so I also prayed for a drop and bam  30 Sentiment that this correction was the  worst crash in history  is incredibly bearish Beep  Boop  I m a robot Here s a copy of     Robin Hood

not convinced of the thesis of a multi year bear market with all these institutions buying in and the maturity of so many projects in crypto Due to the institutions that have joined the crypto market it is inevitable the crypto market is no longer an isolated market  It has exposure to the other financial markets now lmao this is nothing

Can you post a screenshot of that from your wallet please so the community know about it I stake serum at ftx Would suggest the Serum Discord group  They support Sollet  Or Raydium group on Telegram Yeah though I watched this live on binance and it never touched lower than 30 from what I saw so this must have been like a split second Oh good to know I m not alone  If there are rewards indeed that would mean that they re minuscule so much that we don t notice the very small digits adding up on the far right  but that doesn t add up to the 10  yearly rewards Well respected traders saying 100 150 range in this run  My advice  which is worth little  would be to buy projects you believe will have significant utility In the future  solana  And then sit and wait   whilst buying these crazy

exists already and is Solana Front end developer here  now working mostly with salesforce integrations and lwc apex   I m interesting and i think it will be a very good experience I m always happy to meet like minded people Solana really performed well Paper hands Apparantly you have to be able to read fast as fuck as a Solana hodler I like exodus because it pairs with my trezor hardware wallet  and they have a built in exchange so I can trade without having to move it to an exchange   They also tend to support tokens that Trezor has yet to add support for This aged like milk Compared to what Solana is down a bit  but it s not really down compared to the last few weeks  so you re not getting it that cheap  If you are just getting started you want to be very cautious entering right now  Sure you ll kick yourself if you don t and it goes up  but you ll be relieved if it goes down again  Personally I m neither selling or buying new crypto  but I ve been in for years and years and been through years of crypto winter before  You should probably dollar cost average  but a fifth of your funds in now and then wait a bit  if it looks okay put in another fifth and so on  Make sure you diversity your portfolio unless you want to gamble  though any entry this side of a crypto winter is some kind of gamble    While you re waiting read some books on trading   PS NEVER leverage  even the people that know what they are doing have been liquidated en masse again and again recently  crypto whales are out to eliminate each and every one of them https   youtu be jcVek9OnVjw30 minutes of Solana PornThis channel deserves millions of subs smh  anyway  enjoy this segment of why solana is bae we hit back ASAP  that s a good recovery to SOL community Solana is newer it therefore has a lot of newer retail investors who are not used to the price temporarily dropping  they are more likely to panic I like solana  maybe 100 by year end  800 in 3 years maybe Just bought Solana on the dip  then was rewarded by a huge intra day bounce  Wow Hi  I did the same mistake  When I text type localStorage setItem  warning close account   true  to console undefined message appeared  Can you help me about the issue  Thank you for your help It takes time  Slowly build it up 2  is  huge  in the world of passive investments   Call it nitpicky if you want  but what we need is more truth in these numbers  not more making excuses for inaccuracies I m not blaming you for the bad numbers  you just collected them  you didn t make them up   I m just saying that where we can  we need to try to fight against misinformation In addition the falsehoods of Exodus Everstake is leading to their continually being staked at the expense of smaller validators with better returns   That s bad for the network   This information is actively bad and needs to be fought against  not excused I stayed in the market but let s see if  survived  is the right phrase  I expect volatility ahead  keep being conscious and reflective on your strategy Dont believe everything you see  Follow the legit socials Great  Although I didn t like atomic wallet too much when I used it At least with Elon we d be worrying about the environmental impact and not just the market prices  The only problem is maintaining a node for SOL is hardware intensive PEER coin does take this into consideration though I own 2 coins  make me rich Did you try the mobile app  If all else fails  maybe you could take a train to New Jersey or Connecticut or wherever to exchange for Sol from Exodus on your phone lol I thought last year s crash

also notice my balance and available balance are not the same  The available balance is  3 61 though I have no assets or orders waiting to be filled  This is my first buy on FTX US Are you using ftx us  I m having a hard time placing my order because it s telling me size too large when I go to buy  I have 2500 fiat in my usd wallet for immediate use while it passes through my bank acct  I m confused as I ve never experienced this with any other exchange If you want to hold long term then definitely buy as much as you can at this point  no one knows  could go lower  could consolidate  could go higher   i ve been researching all day and seeing what ppl think   mixed views all around   some ppl think bear market some thing just a correction   can t get an answer  if ppl knew we d all know   i m setting market orders around 25 and keeping an eye on the prices to see if i can pick some up for that price  also holding my current sol   but don t do what i do or someone else because no one knows what tmo holds or the coming months   very risky moments rn   but better to buy now than yesterday Fucking Elon Thanks for your response but I m still getting size too large for my order even when it s a market buy Try purchasing through Blockfolio   owned by  FTX US  https   FTX US  but much easier to use for non active traders I get it  thank you  You are a legend  I love learning new things Your buy order would be fulfilled as long as the selling price is at  26 51 or below  If it goes to  26 51 for a split moment and bounces up to  26 52  your order wouldn t be completely fulfilled  unless there were enough sellers to cover the demand at  12 51   Only once it hits that threshold would your buy order activate Does anyone know why I can t buy my SOL   USD on FTX  It s my first time using the exchange and it hasn t been so smooth  I am getting the error of size too large when I m placing my order  I have tried to use smaller increments as well So bassicly  if I place a buy order for example at 26 51  I have a changed it get filled  Or am I in the wrong here It s all supply demand  A huge sell off happened there  Millions of dollars worth was sold and when it reached its bottom at  26 50 that s when buying demand matched selling demand  When you see a huge sell off like that you have to wonder what that entity knows  Could they be keen on a development going to happen soon and that s why they move out of that massive position because they predict a further slide  That s something they know and we don t Yes Yup Congrats  And Just a heads up  if you ever wanna use a swap dex Raydium is frictionless and minimal fees Yeah I m using exodus as well   I use exodus for anything my trezor doesnt support since exodus pairs with it Ended up using Sollet  The UI isn t as great as Metamask but it gets the job done  Still think I ll experiment with other wallets but for the time being it s fine Is this the worst  you haven t been there in 2017 I geuss New York residents can swap any crypto for Solana on Changelly Does that correlate with Chinese work hours  How many of the owners are Chinese I wonder My thoughts are happening right now    we all have seen that Solana is really forcefull even in this market  Yeah we see volatility but it always catch its predicted price after every dump  I continue my adventure with sol with my 90 solana  But I have to admit that I spent min an hour everyday to sol  Lots of projects comin on sol chain and it is really hard to follow How is this the worse crash in crypto history Your post has been automatically

compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns What did you end up going with as literally every answer in this thread has a different response I mean  I believe the best thing to do is buy it on an exchange like  FTX US  https   FTX US   which is easy and pretty great actually  then transfer it to a cold wallet  like a ledger nano   Then you sit on it until  through bloody  nerdgasm inducing wars  Solana becomes the only blockchain in existence  It spontaneously spawns consciousness and develops advanced communication protocols  through smart contracts  naturally  entices an alien race to invest in it and then captures all of their market cap as well Then    you just keep buying the dip  Although  I have no idea why a US costumer would be involved in blockchain at all  I assumed sewing knickers was more your thing https   www exodus com You haven t lost until you sell at a loss Trust Wallet does not support stake accounts or staking operations as per solana wallet guide  https   docs solana com wallet guide apps Truly so    The GANTT is  fuzzier Honestly  it has to be a crash of epic proportions  If you check stock prices over the entire history of the Nasdaq for instance  never in the history of the Nasdaq has stock prices gone as parabolic as it did during a pandemic  Lots of people bought things during the pandemic with money printed from nowhere from the Federal reserve  Historic money printing never seen before  I don t know how ANYONE can not foresee disaster coming ahead  That stock bubble is going to get pricked and when it does  everything is coming down with it  The crypto market tends to mirror the tech stocks exclusively  When tech stocks are going down  that s when Crypto goes down  If the stock market bubble gets pricked  everything is going down south with it Link sorry my bad  will edit this Wait I did mention it was deflationary  In the section when I talk about the token SOL had gone as low as 29 9    I wish I had that power to time the market Honestly it s not an unfounded claim  The entire world has just been hit by a pandemic  most of the major economies are hurting  It s unprecedented in the current global scene  I know there was a pandemic in the Spanish Flu  I really think the world economy works differently now than it did before the US became a superpower   Anyways all that to say  nobody knows what s going to happen The orignal anti yoda bot may have given up but I too hate you Fake Yoda Bot  I won t stop fighting            I am also fighting to unsuspend and  u coderunner1 so join the fight with me

Exodus wallet  staking 10 40  APY Same with MATIC  Held strong as long as it could  then dumped  My two faves We have used the code  CEHV  an hour ago  it was still working Got my Sol Stack to 75 with an average of  46 after buying in my first stack above  55   Put  500 into Ray and am staking   Amazed at the transaction fees and speed of this network   Read the white paper and I am all in on this crytpo  Buying  500 a month for a while The purpose of my sheet is to inform and help people develop a strategy  While a 2  variance can absolutely have an impact  especially over time   it s kind of nitpicky to correct me on this  If you ve looked at my sheet  I m sure you ve noticed that there are two featured platforms that pay interest on SOL  Exodus at 10 39   the topic of this conversation  and OKEx at 0 68   If I were looking at this sheet for the very first time  having just discovered the possibility of earning interest on the SOL I just bought  and looking for the best place to earn said interest  this sheet would lead me to Exodus  However   if  what you re now telling me is  the correct rate were to be displayed  this sheet would lead me to Exodus No question  We re headed deep Happy to be here  Actually want to build on the almost 13 little Solana I have  It s already been a wild ride 2nd chance is here   hope your still alive I actually bought more solana during the crash  Even though I lost my shirt on a few coins  I pulled from one to buy more solana  It s actually one of the few I believe in  Go team I grabbed 24mil more   I m not going anywhere   Grab and fa get about it     then  if I see another dip  I ll snag a larger amount   Getting some every single payday   I wold love to retire sooner than later   To the moon  Alice Hahaha better times ahead  my

cutting off power to miners  some say that US is probing into binance as there are allegations of money laundering Most of use were expecting the market to crash but this was unprecedented as SOL had a bull run ever since its inception  I saw my portfolio evaporate in a span of 6 hours A multichain Raydium would be an absolute dream  but if you re looking for a multichain DEX I d check out Thorchain   Thorswap or ASGARDex Would you settle for  33  Cause it s about there now  Bought more myself at around  34 50  bringing my average cost down into the low 40s  Will add some more if it hits the mid 20s or so Search  This question is asked hundreds of times every day FTX When in doubt   hodl on to your SOLs FUD That s true  but last epoch was particularly bad because there is an issue with slow epochs currently  stretching the epoch length out means lower APY as the rewards are being delivered over longer periods of time    This current epoch is likely to be similarly bad   The devs have a fix in place   I ve seen it in code   that should help with this when it becomes part of the officially supported validator software release soon So what I prefer to do is  look at the average over the previous 10 epochs  which is around 8 12  for Everstake Almost all the wallet front ends and big players are stretching the truth   It s universal   I ve seen some even claim 15  There is no regulation   They can say whatever the want   I guess we should be surprised that they don t just lie harder  because apparently lots of people will believe them It is true that about two months ago  Solana APY was 13    15    That is because back then  there was much less Solana staked  and the rewards are constant each epoch and delivered to the  staked accounts   which means that if there are fewer staked accounts  each one gets a larger share of the rewards So probably they started advertising their rate closer to back then  but then never updated it to reflect current conditions   But it s been at least 6   8 weeks since APY was above 10    And that s like forever in the Solana world where staking for profit only became a thing three months ago   So I think these sites should try harder to keep their info up to date and accurate Every Solana stake account does that  and the APY of 8 12  I quote already takes that into account Welcome to crypto Bought more Because SOL didn t sell off until later in the evening  whereas other cryptos started selling off earlier  24 hours ago other cryptos had already began selling off  so the difference between now and this time last night isn t as pronounced  whereas the current decline   for SOL is comparing the pre crash price to now  Give it a few hours and the percentages should normalize a bit FTX us is great I love seeing these Don t take financial advice from random people on Reddit  Sell or buy if you think it s a good idea Take profit would be the smart thing while its still up Volatility up means volatility down Yes I know I was just curious if both Because it s a top 15 coin by market cap  I just don t see 15 billion getting added to the SOL market cap in one day    Think homie   for a 2x the market cap would need to double  Retail plebs in Coinbase have 15 billion laying around  Be realistic I found Icp only it s ridiculous  But Icp on Binance was at 2000  compared to 900 on coinbase   any way 500  profits LOL  Do you know for other coins Literally  thousands of people in america on use coinbase  Its huge  Also seen as a vote of confidence for USA regulations because coinbase tries not to list things that are bound to be sued by the SEC Doesn t matter  they are essentially the same thing and each are free  Usually  coinbase lists soon after on ftx us click usdc then copy the SPL usdc address and send your usdc from solely there Oooog my god Cartesi went from  7 to 1 8 in 4 days after the listing  Rlc went from 3 to 18  So why you think sol will only fo 50 emoji Is this a coinbase pro only listing or will it be on coinbase also There are folks on the side who have only traded stocks  bonds  mutual funds and CDs onFidelity  Schwab or other similar platforms  I tried creating an account on Binance  with my pc warning that they were trying to access the hard drive  Sketchy  Then people complain that crypto they were moving doesn t move  or disappears  Shades of Mt Gox   I hope for an accurate  quick and transparent way to buy  sell  move and stake  with no need to trust the operator of a site and hope he eventually lets me have my investment  when he gets around to it  while I m guessing what I m supposed to do  or asking for advice on Reddit when some sketchy site doesn t work the way I expected Murica Got it  I m on the app You are assuming that old tech is better than new tech  Sure  old tech has been tested by time  but new tech usually brings improvements with it  And just because bitcoin fails  it doesn t mean other blockchains have the same fault in their system You seem to be confusing PoH as a consensus mechanism  It s not  Proof of History only serves as a synchronization mechanism for the order of transactions  The consensus mechanism for Solana is delegated proof of stake  which is pretty different from proof of work  Also Bitcoin doesn t support on chain programs  which is another key difference  Just because they are both blockchains doesn t mean they are the same  And just because Bitcoin was the first  doesn t mean it is the best or the most secure Whether Proof of Work or Proof of Stake is more secure is debatable  but even then  Ethereum uses Proof of Work  why are people not using that as a store of value  It is still better than Bitcoin in every aspect  speed  functionality  costs  even software ecosystem Bitcoin is only endorsed by so many people because so many people have no clue of software or how these systems work  so they stick with the oldest solution  That is like choosing windows 95 over windows 7  because it is probably more secure if it still exists right On PC I went to CB Pro  selected the portfolios tab  and scrolled down through balances and found it  Selected Solana from the list and was able to deposit  I did a small transaction just to test LETS GET IT Warp speed Mr Sulu It will pump to the high 60s  maybe 70s then come to to 50 because everyone who was buying before will be in insane profitThat s just my theory I could be so off Buy the rumor  sell the news I just had the same problem  Glad to see that it s not just me Finally   I can buy without Uphold s spreads Go to coinbase and look up any new listing this year  Find the day on the chart and see what happens within a couple days after I don t see SOL on CB pro yet  Am I missing something I like the way you explain yoself  Well its trading at  48    what s ur thoughts on the pumpAnd shes got the show all to herself no double billing Shit just got REAL Upvote this so that it goes to the front

Why is that bullish  I don t understand  What difference this will make  You already can buy through Binance  uniswap    Etc etc  100 other exchanges and defi s Polygon and Cardano pumped and crashed after Coinbase listing  it s just to be expected  It ll pop back up after Great news for entire ecosystem You are clearly new if you don t understand why bitcoin is valuable and obviously has an impact on the market     Bitcoin is not slow or expensive because satoshi wanted it that way  or miners refuse to make it faster because they are evil       Let s use our brains for a moment  there s definitely an explanation  Think of this for a moment  what would you think is a more secure blockchain  bigger blocks or smaller blocks     If bitcoin is a store of value  where people feel safe to keep their money  what would be the number 1 priority and property that a store of value  Bitcoin  should have  I m gonna let you think about this  a hint    it s not fees and it s definitely not speed     Ok now  why do alts follow Bitcoin     First  Bitcoin is the first crypto to ever exist  it s the living proof that blockchain in fact does work  If somehow Bitcoin is compromised this represents a threat to all cryptos being vulnerable  I mean if a 12 year old crypto fails  what can we expect from the others  Most were developed keeping in mind the fundamentals in which blockchain the bitcoin technology works     Second  Bitcoin has overcome the proof of time  It s survived everything  I ve seen thousands of alts come and go in the last 7 years  and guess what  99  of them eventually die  But Bitcoin remains stronger than ever  I think most people underestimate the power of time  If a crypto wants to earn our trust it needs to get through the test of time  This is the main reason Bitcoin leads the market  because the crypto veterans will use new speculative alts only to accumulate more BTC or even some major alts  They know that when the bear comes  you can always count on daddy Bitcoin     Don t get me wrong I love Solana and I think it could be great  but we still don t know how POH will work if the ecosystem grows exponentially  maybe it s compromised  maybe it has a vulnerability that hasn t been exploited yet  How could we know  it s only been around 2 years  time will tell     Anyways I m not a tech guy  I can only code in python  I m more of an enthusiast but I ve been around long enough to understand why Bitcoin is valuable  In 2018 I wished I didn t hold as many alts as I did RLC is a lowkey a shit coin I never heard of  I m sure SOL will pump then dump hard again but not like RLC  This is really good for the ecosystem And then drop dramatically  look at RLC and how everyone is crying on their subreddit  Be wise Sure  but they are not random  there should be something going on in those peoples heads  And I just don t understand why people who are in something like Solana sell their tokens just because Bitcoin drops  I don t see why that should influence their sentiment towards Solana  Sure it s a crypto currency too  but its still not the same as bitcoin To make money it s not so bad  With chart  you can still make money on coins with no working product and really no other advantage than crypto influencer being paid to shill it Huge Whoever bought at 27  during the dip im jealous lol people focus on charts too much What property makes Bitcoin better than other cryptocurrencies other than its popularity  Bitcoin is basically worse on all metrics except its valuation https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 Hell yeah  We need to spread the word at the utility of Solana transfers  Converting to solana and then sending between exchanges wallets is going to be a gamechanger for arb trades and fast movement in the market 100  this summer  best project out there   2 500 in 5yrs Fuck I wasn t done accumulating  This will pump tf out  of the price It was Kinda buggy  Was trying to exchange some ethereums  1 2 or something   It said the transaction fee was 25 ethereums   contacted support and they confirmed it was a bug Edit  see my printscreen   https   ibb co cyXr1cP LFGG oh lol This is just a meme I come across in the space    I totally agree with you So true  I went to the first townhall and was pretty convinced after that plus a few videos with Anatoly  I think the SBF factor is the final nail in the coffin  Great tech  great backers Too late  I m in Fortunately you ve lucked out and this is a fantastic project with incredible upside   but would advise you DYOR Nice

cnbc com 2021 05 20 us treasury calls for stricter cryptocurrency compliance with irs html 2018 I believe SOLANA already has a dedicated wallet    I use Sollet io to keep all my SOLANA tokens In  Mater fact I m mostly using the SOLANA Dex  ray serum  and moving all crypto funds to the SOLANA ecosystem  SOLANA has such a promising eco system FTX worked through the whole dip for me  bought more at 34 Did it even dip I wish someone savvy enough could create a list that one can add scammers  wallets on and it would automatically update if the funds get moved to another wallet  I m sure a bot can do it  At least this can help with tracking the illicit funds trail Recommend listening to The Solana Podcast  especially any episodes about Project Serum Well said man There is a report ad link next to it if it comes up in your search  I reported it as phishing Thank you for the warning OP  We always count on the HIGH IQ of Solana community  Don t let scammers teal your hard earned assets  in crypto always quadruple check Google web probably is the best alternative https   safebrowsing google com safebrowsing report _phish  hl en Good Catch Well it s buy low sell high  right  Gotta love people who judge the death of an asset on its price fluctuation instead of something more serious have you given thought as how you got hacked Did you enter your mnemonic phrase somewhere  did you get phished  etcIf so  its time to take steps to prevent this from happening and educate the public on where it went wrong   Unfortunately for the lost funds  its gone How do you report It s just because the trade pair is shitcoin BTC  that s all that s why there is so much shit with only fake roadmap still getting evaluated way too much on this market Pyth is going to be insane   Typo at 17 seconds

have lots of diamonds hand  I did not panic to sell anything yet lost a year of my life Most liquidity in the market is tied to Bitcoin through BTC pairs  When BTC moves  everything else moves in some relation I should also say there is a ton of leverage going on  When margin calls come in due to falling prices  many good positions get liquidated to cover  prices drop further  requiring more margin calls and more liquidation Anytime  glad to help So how would i transfer spl usdc from sollet to  ftx us  https   ftx us   thanks Thank you Anything specific that you didn t like I bought 100 Sol at 36USD  Thanks Elon Not much  4 You re attempting to find the logic in a series of millions od emotional decisions  The sooner you understand that many  many people in the markets  especially at this moment  are making decisions based on things other than math and fundamentals  the better for you I m very sorry to hear this  I know this probably isn t what you want to hear right now  but just a few recommendations to stay safe 1  Use a virus scanner to make sure your computer is free of any viruses trojans before creating a wallet 2  When creating your wallet  write down your private key and your password on a piece of paper  Laminate it  and put it in a safe 3  Make sure you are able to restore your wallet and access your wallet using the key and password you wrote down  it s important to make sure you recorded all of the information correctly 4  Do not store your keys or password anywhere else  Especially on the cloud or on any device that can connect to the internet 5  Never give your password or keys to anyone else  Never login using your wallet or click any links that aren t showing as an ecosystem project on the solana website  Scammers are very active I m really sorry you re going through this Thanks  I know some key advantages over other blockchains  PoS and PoH  high tps and low fees  But good read though This is how I was able to buy my first SOL as I was learning  Especially if you aren t moving huge sums of money  its all very easy and quick to set up  I immediately withdrew it to a hardware wallet though  so I can t speak to the exchange risk itself you may not understand btc lol I recommend reading a bit about what you invested in  Search reddit for  The Complete Beginner s Guide to Solana   SOL    The Most Undervalued Top 15 Altcoin  IMO    A member of the community made a great summary of solana and what it s all about Hit the settle button for both and approve the transactions  now you should have what you were expecting in your wallet I don t understand the reasoning  Bitcoin is heavily overpriced and will never live up to its valuation  Yet every better token drops just because Bitcoin drops Didn t read  never selling Just wondering  how do you store your crypto  I m new to this and would like to get into it but was wondering what you use to store such large sum  Are the exchanges themselves ok to store it 65 maybe higher   I expect a short term pop before it settles into a trading range shit  dump eet Savage Up and down and up who knows   Hopefully market not crash again   GOOD LUCK TO YOU Why are you confuse   I m not bump   I believe SOLANA is good and strong   But you invest you need research for yourself  I still holding for a long run couple years   good luck to you too my friend The public allocation is very very small  Company holds like 95 Prob doesn t happen that fast  They are accumulating when it s in infancy 70 would be lovely   90 would be spicy Whatcha think itll spike to  58 was the ath I am much confuse Thank you very much for the thoughtful reply  I use a combination of paper that I created using CLI  trust wallet and sollet wallet  But I m always a little paranoid about the last two  The paper wallet is closest to the blockchain  without any other intermediary software or parties involved  so it definitely makes me feel the most secure From this it says it s pretty safe however I need to double check this stuff before I commit Here is the post about the risk  https   www reddit com r solana comments n0gp18 hodl_or_stake  Quote from member mankinskin it is always possible that the validator you are staking with is     malicious and tries to attack the network in some way and will get     penalized by getting part their stake slashed  which would then be your     stake  So you need to pick validators you trust and you should also     stake with many different validators that don t have too much stake      Because the more decentralized the stake in the network  the more     difficult it will be to attack it Here is Exodus  Solana Staking FAQ Page  https   support exodus com article 1551 solana staking faq about validator They use  Everstake  https   everstake one  I read in a previous post you might lose your SOL if you choose a validator with bad intention I will try to find that post for you Bada bing bada boom Posts like this make it seem like you are talking about a shitty mooncoin  Get out Can we get a daily or weekly thread pleasee dont bring pumping and dumping emoji shit here Thanks  I have seen their Validator requirements info but it just leaves me with no idea of what machine to buy What s the risk with staking   is there any  Or does it work like interest does Nice https   docs solana com I bought 2 at 14     then started to learn more about the ecossystem  Unfortunately I was starting on crypto  so  many things to learn and didn t have enough money  I have 8 coins now and trying to get more as possible  Feels good Very quality post on 4 Chan  thanks for sharing I d recommend picking multiple validators and spreading your stake around  You can use sites like solanabeach io to help you pick a few good ones and make sure they re geographically spread out  Also  validators will use 0  commissions usually to raise capital  meaning they will likely raise at some point  That shouldn t discourage you from using them  but make sure to keep an eye on them I d highly recommend visiting the Solana discord  You can talk to a lot of the validators there or even just see their conversations and get an idea of which ones are worth trusting your stake to This sub is a really refresh from other subs  That part about the market cap is really  hard  for people to understand  To me specially  I thought about the  adding more money to double the cap   until a guy wrote some paragraphs explaining what u guys were talking about  I m gladly I revised this topic and found that I understood it  Thank you guys for your patience in writing this  Hope you all well Just put  15k at 47 9  Let s go I m not American  so please enlighten me  when A coin get listen on coinbase  it goes up drastically Edit  FYI the kin subreddit has been aware of sol for about a year now Get kyc verified on binance us and get it before trading opens on coinbase  More then likely it will run up in price like nearly every other project that gets listed Just withdraw  9 999 per transaction and you re good The  rummor  was last week https   www reddit com r KinFoundation comments naxk1t rumor_from_the_solana_sub_sol_coinbase_listing  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share I like your excitement Does it take more time  I don t see it yet Another 100 coins are being listed at the same time Any gains are gonna be marginal and short lived Also  what do you guys see happening due to the listing  A crazy run up to  150 or something like that  Kind of like ETC  To be frank  I d rather avoid that  Timing the market has never worked for me and I d rather buy afterwards based on the merit of the project Also  9am PST for anyone else out there who s just seeing this now Spot on likely  I only have a little and was about to buy more  I am going to have to just wait it out not for the pump and new floor Any other blockchain is as good as Bitcoin to do that  There are other proof of work blockchains and whether PoW is more secure than PoS is debatable  Gold can not be replaced by any digital currency  That is just a bitcoin bull slogan Good  we can buy more and they can pump the price later I wonder if we saw the massive drop in SOL yesterday so coinbase could acquire some SOL before the announcement this morning News Storj too This is the rumor and the news will be  Solana now listed on CBP  Similar thing happened when they listed ADA   Climbed right up until the moment it was listed then dumped and eventually recovered Or maybe not  who knows Here s a start  Reg coinbase has non listed assets  that they let you track for educational purposes  That s kinda where they pull from for formal listings and they get updated  some get added  some fall off  Not all of them get listed  So I always go through that list to get a little familiar in case we get an announcement like today   You want to make money  get in on a token before the coinbase listing  Theres more   but for another day     what goes up      absolutely goes down    Golden rule Congratulations   must be an amazing feeling Okay and price willBe what lol tell me how heavy a bag should be But how could you prove that an account on that list was a scammer  and not just somebody innocent who had their legitimate account added to the list by a griefer I know  but I d have had to find out about it first  I thought I was paying attention 58 is the ath  I would hope it would get above that  at least  Extremely low distribution 272m supply  It s a minute amount that the company has allocated   I d like to see at least 70s  Of course 90 wouldn t hurt my feelings Sorry now I am at a point where I have to admit ignorance   I have never used any wallet other than sollet  briefly  like I mentioned  and a  paper wallet  using the Solana command line A lot of people trust and use the Ledger hardware wallet   I have never used it but like I said  I heard good things Unfortunately  with security  it s very hard to have both convenience and high security   They are kind of opposed to each other   So any solution I recommend as being truly secure  like a paper wallet  is going to be cumbersome   I deal with that  but you might not be willing to You might compromise by keeping the majority of your balance in a paper or hardware wallet  which you only have to use when you want to  top up  your smaller sollet wallet   If your  working set  of SOL that you need on a daily basis is small  then this could work If you re doing lots of trading with large sums on Serum  then maybe look into the hardware Ledger device I m hoping others will have more informative opinions  like I said I m a bit out of my depth here   I just use a paper wallet for everything  which is super secure  but yes  quite cumbersome   But I don t move SOL very often at all so it s OK for me Your not paying attention nor doing enough research   This is a daily information hustle  Things change super fast  If you re a long term investor with a set it and forget it type of attitude  Then yes   you may not have to stay on top off as much as you can didnt realize the staking rewards tracker with solflare   just checked it out   looks cool When does it start They really need to fix the wallets  This is literally the most important thing for a crypto currency  They must work correctly every single time for people to trust them and use them  I don t understand why solflare has so many issues still after months and months of complaining  I don t trust them enough to even store my money in them at the moment  I tried to hook up my ledger with solflare and it was buggy as hell so I aborted  Solana is a GREAT company but they need to fix the wallets yesterday Which DEX or exchange is buying souls r WallStreetBets is crossing over My man people on other subs still dislike solana quite a bit    still early That s a toofir I have no doubt we will see those numbers eventually  If it happens this week cool  If it happens later this year even better  I m not done buying and I want it cheap 65   75 Similar to me saying  people who control part of the world   But again  no need to put yourself down  You have very valid arguments and everything you said is correct  I have to coach my juniors all the time to build self confidence  there is no need to be harsh on yourself  the rest of the world does that on your behalf already  But anyways   have a great day  i ll have another beer Epic   just blasted it all in my watsup chats WTF did they just sneak that in When I call myself a retard then of course I do it in part because it s a meme that I find funny  On the other hand  as an engineer in a technical field  I have low confidence in my knowledge on how financial markets work and I realize that there are people on different platforms that do this professionally so when I state my argument from a humble and honest place of being clueless it is easier to open up communication channels and have an eye to eye discussion on all kinds of topics  Of course there is a risk of it being a complete waste as other people here may be even less informed than me If I d reply in a serious manner to an unknown guy that clowns my opinion with no context to back himself up  then that discussion has nowhere to grow and I m not helping myself learn  I would say that  staying in line  is exactly what I m trying to do by writing this way   gt  Again this is the Solana reddit  we are not WSB idiots I think you are either underestimating wsb or overselling the crowd on this sub u SwissPrivateWanker    lolThanks for your input though  much appreciated Cuz we special So I just got an alert about your coin that it is headed to coinbase  I d never heard of it before  Did it really got from  40 to like 50 dollars in a year  That s awesome but also mad depressing if true because I don t know how I m doing crypto so badly That s just silly  How else are you supposed to function in a modern world  There are legit question that need searching  I just happened to spot this phishing scam on one of those searches  You should always be cognizant of what you click on Buy the dip     mehhhhhhhh Just in case it needs to be said You should never be searching for crypto related things with a search engine no matter how trustworthy you think they are for exactly this reason  Make liberal use of your bookmarks and or your brower s speed dial I completely agree  I don t know how many opportunities I missed watching other coins booming since last quarter of 2020 just because I was a bit scared  But I never regretted it  I feel completely the opposite for Solana  But it is never too late I believe Once Coinbase launches Sol  the  normies  will be piling in fast Related to the order book of the stock exchange  in crypto market happening often  Last month eth try on binance exchange  touch 0  but i think nobody manage to buy it lol Hi Dude  Sry to hear that but i dont think someone can help you Once the funds left your wallet they are gone It hurts but for the next time connect a hardwarewallet to your sollet then it not possible to hack without your hardwarewallet as you need to confirm every transaction I m heavily in  But total punt and haven t read a thing about Solana Yes  I have unsettled balance for Ray and Sol  I have an option to  deposit  or  settle   The slippage was set to 1 You can actually directly withdraw to most Sol Wallets  I d suggest starting with Sollet since it is the most compatible  but you could also check out Phantom  there are a number of beta join codes on Twitter and other places you can send usdc spl to ftx exchange and then withdraw on the erc20 ethereum chain but do the kyc first as you can t withdraw over 1000 without kyc  Also i think it is possible using the sollet io wallet and having some eth in metamask to send out usdc on the erc20 chain but i haven t tested it Ofc  Here it rather means how much you believe in this project Nice catch  I ve purchased some  38  If it dips further down to 2x  I ll all in Thank you for advocating for accuracy and understanding  The world could use more people that value knowledge and who fight against misinformation  If you can link me to your source for this info on Exodus  true rate I ll happily update my sheet Fwiw  I ve had a great experience with FTX   Get through it The thing is that in Kucoin is that SOL is trading only in     Futures      no SPOT Trading there yet  But overall  your idea isn t bad at all  it might be a good solution for you  Imgur  https   imgur com 2Hs3oXp Market psychology yes but why   what makes other people sell Sol or not want to buy Sol just because the biggest currency is being sold Make sure you re on the USD SOL market  If you aren t level 2 verified  I don t think you get instant deposits  If not  it could take 3 5 business days for the funds to be useable Thanks for the reply  Would the best process be to convert USDT to SOL and then transfer to Kucoin  then sell SOL to USDT Plz help me in solving problem I am getting error in selling tokens in serum dex showing error placing oder time out awaiting confirmations on transtition It has 50  of the entire market    when it goes down  market goes down Binance  And staking on exodus same here  not confidence inspiring when it takes 20 minutes to wait for staking account to turn up  and also having issues with the validator list loading   It seems a bit pointless having a blockchain that is allegedly so fast  but takes so long to be able to do what should be a simple task What do you use now for a wallet Because bitcoin is the first crypto created  the first one by market cap and is leading the market  If it dumps  everything dump I panicked and bought What kind of reason is  it s the thousand pound gorilla of the market   How does that make people follow it Did you solve this problem with solsaver  I have the same issue Desktop Release 2 29 0  19 05 2021  New features   New coin Solana  SOL  supported  SOL is available for holding  sending and exchanging in the wallet   Bug fixes   ZIL sending and staking issues fixed from the atomic wallet download page They all follow bitcoin to some extent because it s the thousand pound gorilla of the market  but I believe SOL actually follows it less than almost any other coin We still doing black face memes  This is 2021 Thank

www oxygen org docs wallet html Yeah  I found the relevant transaction by looking up my wallet address  Its saying the stake has been initialized but hasn t been delegated yet  which is correct I ve had the same thing with my first time staking this morning  My best guess is that it s Solflare having some problems and everything s still fine and you can see the wallet and transactions in the explorer Reassuring to know its not just me Same here  do i just have to wait  what do you advise me to do If you go to the trading tab for sol ray pair and connect your wallet  is there any unsettled balances  What was your slippage set to  and when your ray went from 10 to 6  did you get any corresponding sol back I got in Sol at 4 dollars but i will still hold i strongly believe in Sol Use ftx

Pyth to come out Agree Why not added to reg Coinbase MFW  https   nyc3 digitaloceanspaces com memecreator cdn media __processed__ 5d5 template first time 899 0c6db91aec9c jpeg  people talk about the dip Most coins dump after a pump from coinbase listing and it looks like its turning down already i could be wrong put it this way  bitcoins destiny is for it to replace gold until it s done that  it has upside  I think this gives it like 9x upside still With Bitcoin  it depends on the exchange  Some require two block verifications before they acknowledge the transaction and update your asset balance  and some require up to four verifications  In the former case  it ll take about 30 minutes in my experience  and in the latter case  it ll take over an hour Typically  when buying altcoins  I buy an extra  20 worth of bitcoin when transferring to another exchange where the altcoin I want is listed to cover transaction fees I ve endeavored to never buy another ERC20 token until  or if  Ethereum 2 0 launches  because the fees are a goddamn nightmare Thanks Question is what will it spike to on the listing day   My guess is  58   I d put a limit sell order at  58 and a limit buy order after that of  45 for the inevitable post listing drop back down to reality   Easy way to print   25  more SOL for your portfolio I see sol being a trillion dollar cap some day  buy at  10   30   1000It drops  I buy Why do you think that Wow  crash or no crash   This might be a really good buy   sell in the short term Eggplant     champagne     champagne     This is the moment I have been waiting for WE ARE  2bn away from being in the top 10  THIS IS FUCKING LEGENDARY  Riding since  2 on SOL   let s do this yes but is this the rumor or the news Welcome  its the best coin out there and dramatically undervalued With ETH  if you got lucky and included in the next transfer block it would be around 5 minutes  and cost just under  50 USD in gas feesEdit  want to add that most of time in my OP is exchanges  Wallet to wallet transfer in Solana can be like 30 seconds Is it hust me or does it look like its gona dump Stop calling yourself a retard  it s quite annoying   Yes you are right  This is how markets work  You don t need to add  15bn of fiat money or crypto equivalent to double the market cap    Your reasoning is right   no need to go all WSB on us  The guy arguing with you does not understand markets  but he seems to have understood your reasoning in the end and come to the understanding on how markets work  All markets can jump in price on new news and you don t need new money to flow for a market cap to double Again this is the Solana reddit  we are not WSB idiots  Stay in line  I have a fancy job  the people who recommended SOL to me control part of the world  If you want to fit in  start accepting that you are smart and your reasoning make sense instead of demeaning yourself in front of everyone Noob here  How long would transactions take with other common crypto currencies usually  How much would the fee be if the dollar worth of the amount being transferred is comparable Some people maybe  my sympathies  but others of us lucky ones live elsewhere    In general  reading that  news  piece as fud personally Thank you for your reply  but the Delete button does not show on my  wallet  I can only see the Receive and Send buttons  I am using the Chrome browser I m not sure why you d be getting that error  I ve been happy with ftx and had no issues  Perhaps you placed a limit order and then tried to increase the price but have insufficient funds Yessssss awesome news  hope errbody been stacking up SOL while its been on sale the past 24hrs Well let s hope we get  15B invested and it rockets us 10x then lol You d imagine  and I d imagine the same  But clearly us retards don t really know about these types of dynamics which is the whole reason why I was writing the first comment to begin with  So I can learn from people who do know  I was just illustrating that  market cap    money in the system  in all cases  Glad you were able to get my point through this toy market lol There is a     Delete     Button as you can see in here next to SPL tokens you have in Sollet  you may click on it https   i postimg cc Qx5TXx99 image png Fair enough  I see what you mean You re right that market needs to double for token price to double  That follows basic math What the other user is trying to articulate here is that not all tokens are being traded constantly  The price of the token is simple based on what someone is willing to pay for the token at that moment in time and the liquidity in the market Here is an extreme example  99 99  of all tokens are locked up staking  there is only 1 sol token actively being traded on the market  Buyer pays 1000  to buy 1 sol  New market price on exchanges is 1000   sol market cap just went 20x  So his point is that we don t necessarily need 15 billion in fresh money to pump the price up  The true number is probably far lower Hell yeah brutha Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns I see what you mean  That s an admittedly wild scenario though and sol wouldn t have one person 10xing while another never sold haha it s gonna go up in increments of cents  so the market cap should reflect the amount of money being poured into it pretty accurately I d imagine Pro will do a 3 day announcement   set up their stages and go live  with 3 day heads up  Reg coinbase will just list it at the same time and a couple hours later put a banner up to say its newly listed When I first started and new listings were popping up I realized quick I was way behind the 8 ball being in  the know So here is an example I can come up with to explain what I mean In some fanatsy world there are 10 bars of gold in the whole world  A mining company owns all the gold and sells each for 1k   So now there are 10 people that bought a bar of gold each The price was 1k  there are 10 units total  the market cap is simply 10k Now news drops that gold plating needs to be used for some new anti matter engine and scientists and engineers from the big engine manufacturers scramble to get their hands on this gold The people holding the gold are unwilling to sell at first  but 2 guys cave and sell their bar for 10k each  The price is now 10k per bar  This means the market cap is 100k now  even though the total money that went into the system is only 28k  for 2x10k  and 8x1k   Now after a week of people holding  another company offers 30k to one of the 8 guys and he sells  Now the market cap is 300k and the total investment into gold bars is 57k    1x30k 2x 10k 7x 1k As you can see the market cap does not need to reflect what amount of money is actually in the system  Market cap assumes that everyone holding would be able to liquidate their assets at current market prices  which can be true in certain market situations  but clearly doesn t have to be  I understand that this example has it s own problems and why it doesn t represent crypto markets well  It was just meant as a toy scenario I bought SOL on  FTX US  https   FTX US   Seems pretty good and non sketchy so far Ok have a good day dude idk what you re on about Yessir lets goo CryptoBanter called this last week gt  Just trust that we re right haha idk how to help nowlmao you clearly understand what you re talking about  when you can t even explain yourself  We agree on how it s calculated  that part is obvious  What I initially disagreed with was that new investors would have to add 15B into the system for prices and market cap to double in the short term  Ultimately you d be able to scalp the price to match actual money in the system to market cap if trading volume is high enough Coinbase pro is adding Sol CryptoBanter called this last week full retards like me also look at market cap because it s a useful number to look at  I am by no means trying to claim that Solana will double because of this news Hm you lost me  Just trust that we re right haha idk how to help now  Look at Amazon s market cap when the stock was worth  1000 and its market cap when it was worth  2000  You ll see the market cap doubled  It s math  not theory or baking As I said I m not a tech guy  so yes my technicals are flawed  But POH still remains something new  And new is always riskier and more speculative than old  not just on crypto but on everything We can debate about this all day but that s the reality Idk about you but in my case trust needs to be earned  As I said thousands of cryptos have come and go in the last years  and bitcoin still remains  So in most cases what seemed very promising ended up being a complete failure    And no  this time isn t different  It applies to everything  how many wow killers failed  how many apple killers failed  how many amazon killers failed  I m not saying that Solana will fail  but it s too early to know what s gonna happen  About correlation  markets are correlated and always have been  That s just how market sentiment works  The vast majority of the alt pairs are stable alt or btc alt  So yeah it makes sense that if BTC dumps so does the pair Of course that s how it works from a calculation perspective  but again market cap is not a real thing  it is just a theoretical number you can calculate from price per unit and total suppy  It s like saying Bread   Flour   Eggs  It doesn t make sense to claim Flour   Bread   Eggs even though it makes sense from an algebra perspective This is a great point  Any wallets in particular you recommend  What s your opinion on trustwallet  mobile phone wallet Well most non retards look at market cap when they figure the value  Most people know that a top 20 crypto will not double in value over a Coinbase listing alone  so they ll sell it long before an unknown coin that could have a reason to double Would love that Market cap and price of sol are directly correlated 1 1 as long as the amount of minted sol stays constant From my experience   the inexperienced realize after a couple months a possible guaranteed way to make quick money is to buy right at the listing day  coinbase  they dont know yet to get ahead of it by buying on other platforms   Also these folks arent on coinbase pro  that is the venue to have a 3 day announcement of listing  So they see it and react  After this huge dump  it could also play for people to think they can make up some lost money by buying in at the day of trading   or before  One thing I like is its listing on it s own  so it will get all the attention   I m hoping for a  90 high  Essentially a 2x from today  Wild west out there  skies the limit We said the same thing  just rearranged the equation  And it does mean you d have to add  15B in market cap to double  Just use your own equation you wrote out  Market cap  15b     45  sol price  x supply  Constant value here   Now change that sol price to  90 and see what happens to the market cap  again  the supply is a constant  not variable Yep I m thinking  69 420 I thought it was Market Cap   Price per Sol     of total tokens  If price doubles  market cap follows suit automatically  Doesn t mean that people would have to invest an additional 15B for prices to double imo  Let me know if my thinking is off here or why this can t be right  Market cap is just a theoretical number that you can calculate  it doesn t really exist  like price does That is a pretty large sum to keep in a medium security wallet like sollet   It makes me sick to think of anyone losing that much money to hackers  I m really sorry it happened I personally have used sollet but only for small sums and only as a throw away wallet for temporarily doing a few transactions   I would not store any SOL in a sollet wallet long term Why   Because it doesn t support any passphrase  and because it stores your details as a cookie on your browser   I don t know all the ways that cookies can be stolen  but I would imagine there are many   I wouldn t trust data stored in that form as being particularly secure   I wouldn t really even trust the  delete wallet  method of removing the cookie  who knows if browser bugs or whatnot could keep the data around somewhere Unfortunately  truly secure wallets are much more cumbersome to use   But it s the only way I would ever store that much value in a wallet   For small sums and transient balances  something like sollet is fine this will be fun to watch  First time I finally was able to buy in right after the coinbase tweet  So a few days to watch movement on binance us and then when it hits coinbase Price per sol   market cap     of total sol tokens You d need to double the market cap in order to double the price of the token  assuming the amount minted hasn t changed Only in a world of fools would a reasonable person assume a stranger on the internet trusts them  It s sad  really  Unless  of course  the world is full of reasonable people and the person assuming trust is the fool  I m interested in accuracy and it s application to my spreadsheet  If you re willing to take the time  I d appreciate a dm with a more direct explanation of what you re suggesting in the last stanza of this comment  I d love to work together to bring more accuracy to my sheet and to inform other investors  I have a passion for developing  seems kind of an odd word choice here but it s the best I ve got  people and I think sharing this sort of knowledge could be a real leg up for a lot of people  Any smart person knows  that the way to serve oneself is to serve one s community Go on twitter to coinbase pro account Scan down they have announcements over the last couple months  It s worth the due diligence Wow   brutal sub Please drop some education in here  I m eager to learn Very good strategy  congrats Yeah you were right in the first part of your reply I m just a retard like everybody else  but I don t think this is how market prices work  There is no need for people to invest 15 billion for the market cap to double  at least in the short term  If people are unwilling to sell low and there is some amount of volume that is buying at high prices  the prices and market cap will go up
2021-05-21,44.44725253,47.64559102,33.83739606,Also they seem to advertise on serum to not use their site and use raydium    serum has been mad glitchey lately and I wouldn t be surprised if the pool was actually empty   The serum site is so laggy it pissed me off to the point I m never doing anything on there again as long as they are in beta No prob Thanks Not sure  I have never used Exodus Same I wish No  each coin that gets listed on coinbase  pumps slightly beforehand  then dumps on the day of listing Have you any updates or resources for the economics of becoming a node validator  Can you make money investing in this from a validation perspective How do you check stake balance on exodus What dip  You all didn t buy in at  2 Worked it out  Thanks again Prob to 60 at best because of we are in a bear market right now Copy and paste addresses and double check the last 4 digits  This is what makes crypto crypto Sorry what do you mean  Based on history there s a sell off Sunday night or shortly after open on Monday Indeed  mine showed up after 2 hours I guess I need to be more patient sollet io Im literally buying as much as a can  A decentralized network that has 18 billion transactions completed in less than a year is worth wayyyyyyy more than 10 20 billion just look at historical launches  literally every coin had a selloff near term If the market price is lower on one exchange  say FTX  and higher on another  say Coinbase   then you could buy on FTX and sell on Coinbase to make a profit  People do this  and that raises the price on FTX and lowers on Coinbase until the prices are very close to each other Being listed on Coinbase can cause a price to go up because it will make a lot of people hear of Solana for the first time and have an easy  buy now  button in front of them  Being listed on Coinbase can also indicate that a coin is becoming a serious leading cryptocurrency I did my bit and deposited all my SOL on CBPro Thanks a lot Thanks a lot You know what d be cooler  Five or six Solana spl tokens be on the top 10 following Solana How low will it go though Go the  welcome channel  amp  choose a role that suits your needs  community  Developer  Validator      by clicking on the right emoji  that way everything will be visible to you   Imgur  https   imgur com sIo8yPG PS  make sure you Discord is phone verified or else you won t be able to write in Solana Discord 200 quite alot for me though Yep i search on Sol explorer  but no option to update Oh  but why sending the whole amount at once  Transaction Fees are so cheap  you could ve always try small amount of SOL first  like 0 01 SOL   if succeeded  amp  went though  you may go ahead  amp  send the rest  This is my golden rule in crypto You may always contact Coinbase support if the address you sent your SOL to is 100  correct Maybe too late  Sixthed You d still need a frontend  Don t know if you ever tried writing a frontend in rust  Wouldn t recommend it   But yeah learning rust is still a good idea I m not calculating anything  It says under statistics in green numbers 11 62  rewards APY   It used to say 12 You can buy sol with crypto in u atomicwallet  Unfortunately it s available on the desktop version  however it will be rolled out on the mobile versions Notice it today and move my sol there  Looking forward to staking as I m already staking some coins in the Wallet I just moved mine to Atomic Wallet because I have most of my cryptos there and don t want extra wallets on my phone  As we speak  it s support storage and exchange  I beleive the will enable staking anytime soon Easy don t use Coinbase lesson learned Can t you just search for your token address I m not buy the dip Sorry to hear  How much was it Like 10 13  I think  And its APY in Solflare  It gets automatically added to your staking amount  so you don t have to claim That s weird  huh  Thanks for the info Deposits are open and you can already transfer on the website if you re using a computer  Seems to just not be working for the app FTX Haha great to hear  thanks for the gold  Can I exchange it for SOL I heard trading was supposed to open Monday  so around then I think Took like 6 hours for mine to show up yesterday  just slow because of overwhelming traffic I m sure here ya go  https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 I tried but i can only see Chinese channels for some no reason  no English Ive used it for years  and it indeed is the best UI wallet ive come across  Just wish they were open source  their wallet is basically a black box  so  trust is required I m just talking out of my     here  No one knows for sure  I believe in SOL long term but every time I start to get confident about where prices are going  they go the opposite direction  Just do the opposite of what I recommend and you ll go to the moon Unless you have deep pockets or connections in crypto community it s not going to work anyway  I read that you need about 30 000 sol or 1 2 million dollars worth just to break even on the costs of validating  You could attract delegators with your node being published on Solana beach but you d have to attract them with low or no commissions until you get your stake up  I recommend searching the official Solana forum and seeking out people there  It s going to cost at least  20 000 until it starts paying

being a nightmare  I like how Solana is engineered so the fees should get cheaper over time do you have a source The thing about crypto is people telling others to invest without learning what crypto is  and no  a 10 minute video does not count as a learning  If you really want to get someone onto crypto  tell them to do a short free course  There was one on EdX that was preatty cool and free Yes  3XL Yes Yes LAlthough we wont be taking L s in the sol train anytime soon Yes  L try to ask here  https   discord gg solana Yess sssssss Yes Yes I m not debating you  Idc  I come on Reddit to shitpost  I can tell the recent dump has everyone on edge arguing semantics  I hope you have a good day friend  We both hold SOL  We are on the same team  Sorry to be rude earlier  And I still think I m right so we can agree to disagree Yas Yes  Make em Yes please  ‍ ️ yes  L Yes yes  XL Yeah  I m thinking the more access  more buyers  wider adoption  Nothing to do with price difference between exchanges YES Yes please Perfect ty Ah really  So the market price is shared across the exchanges  So is it a matter of more available buyers for the same supply of tokens  That s why prices tend to appreciate 24th Any word on this You cant  easier to use interfaces that use readable accounts rather than long keys will solve this in the future  But until then  be careful and always double check Same price

morning didn t understand it  Is it up and running yet 4  ymax the  open source smart contract  is serumYes  you are correct about Serum DEX sorta being the generic  They allow protocol and dapp

that too  I use FTX Thank you I am in for the long but trust me I feel we have to brace for impact  2025 Sol will be a top 5 project   a least 10T Crypto MC  base on fundamentals alone yet the road there is fill with up and down  right now there too much emotion and manipulation on the market So what s the best strategy  I have sol on binance  should I be transferring it to Coinbase to sell  or should I keep it on binance and sell there  What s get me the best outcome Monday morning Jelly Sizzle and Jizzle Yes Yes Could be  What about after the actual listing Yes Prices rise after the listing is announced and always dump shortly thereafter  Combined with the ongoing semi crash  I predict SOL stays in the  35  45 range for the next two months Yes So you learn via YouTube  now it make sense Hahaha you had lost the debate in the most predictable way Calling out my old meme comment and account age is exactly a noob move   It s like kid lose a fight and tell the winner   But my

remind them everyday costing them more than its worth lolheck I ordered a pizza the other night and accidentally hit the wrong button so my fault they still sent me another free of charge goes to show

this market research is for Yes please And stickers too Yeah  I would invest the money in less risky assets and live with the passive income   But ofc keep some in crypto and some more risk reward assets  too  but not risking the total amount that I would need to get a minimum wage monthly  that would be good nice plan   i am planning to retire soon but with staking rewards  not capital gains Yes I second that  Just the S is nice and simple Hi  How reliable is the info on this stakeview app  I notice it s by  Shinobi Systems and  Shinobi Systems  happens to be the no 1 on top Where did  Shinobi Systems  get the   of others from Is there another source  Thanks for coins that are literally nowhere to be bought i would agree but SOL is close to everywhere so no bugger cares Cheeky You saved me just the s with no circle or word mark would be sexier  no ICP had a big bump recently from Coinbase listing With current market conditions  I would expect  50 55 and then a dump into the high mid 30s before coming right back to the 40s and then consolidate until BTC makes some sort of move Yeah I seen it already dunno why if anybody have skills in CSS and want to take a look Hello  we

reaction wasn t very strong at all  so that s all good and goofy Closer to  39 than  50  Gees  9am est  yeah I m with ya YES YES YES the logo you want on your body  shirts  car and wife  Solana all the way Even if this was a good strategy  OP wasn t asking your opinion about this Upvote for the high quality historical meme with Diogenes snubbing Alexander the Great Ledger  staked on Solflare com got a few hundreds SOL stake in Moonlet using Nano X  No issues so far Amused that you think we re the confused ones    D Sir everyone in Dolores Park said you were the guy with the golden pots There is always one You see what i mean  it s possible  you just have to tell them   no problem  i can wait as long as i get my USDC SPL back    What they said means they don t have more   resources    AKA support agents  to dig into problems like that They are probably trying to ditch problems like this  amp  don t even bother to help people who lost their money there i just tried again but they said    The technical side tells me that they do not have enough facilities to support you in this case         So should I continue until they do BTC is not for using it  It s slow and expensive  This is why they need a HOLD cult around it  The only purpose is to hold forever  Because of  reserve of value   They will eventually realize that an useless inefficient asset won t reserve value better than a crypto that can actually be used  But it will be a looping painful road of underperforming the market  Since high fees came back  it has happened Ok go to YouTube and look up how market cap works and leave me alone plz because y all are so confused I dumping around 50  sorry  it s been beating around this price way too long  There are lot of other possible 10x 20x 50x 100xers  Sol will most likely go to 100  within a month if the bullmarket keeps going on but that s just not big enough gain for me How old his account is or how wild his predictions are doesn t change the fact that in this regard he s correct  Saying that doubling a  15B market cap requires  15B is just wrong Simple example  Someone creates a new crypto with 1000 coins  they get it listed somehow and sell just one coin for  1  It now has a  1000 market cap and yet only  1 ever  entered  the market  It should be  obvious why saying that it will now require  1000 to raise the price to  2 is incorrect Very useful  I would like to see 50   in the next hour  D Fithed Didn t know there was that high a entry point  Thank you Right  What powerful computer should I look into getting  Or a mineral that would work  Thanks Fifthed This is a bad move   manipulation to come soon no one Fourthed Looks nice  simple UI  Thank you for sharing this with the SolFam PS  does it really kind of shaking or i m having browser bugs lol oh thank you so much  i will try more YES it s possible  amp  they ll ask you for a FEE  like 5   someone told me this to get his COPE tokens back  he sent them  to Binance SOL Wallet by mistake too  You might have some support agent telling you that this is impossible to recover  you just keep nagging on them  amp  opening new support tickets till you get luck with the right agent that really understand the problem That SOL Wallet is under their control  amp  they are the only ones that have its keys Shocking that the Solana exchange would have high volume of Solana  This is misleading at best NO NO NO  you keep opening Support Tickets till you get lucky with the right support agent  someone like you before the support told him so  then later on another agent told him it s possible but they ll have to take a FEE  5   to dig more into it  amp  get his COPE back  he sent his COPE SPL tokens to his Binance SOL address   You keep nagging on them  amp  tell them this EXACTLY     The SOL Wallet to which i sent my USDC SPL in your exchange is under your control  you are the only ones having its keys  so you can get my USDC SPL back to my sollet wallet    Your USDC SPL are there into their SOL  wallet  that s a FACT No crypto taxes in Portugal  Some countries just better than others I like FTX  I stake SOL there for 10  APY i believe Also hold some in sollet wallet for access to the Solana ecosystem at this point  will binance fork solano for better smart chain than current smart chain  amp  x200B as we knew bsc is fork of ethereum with some modification Thanks for the response  Still not having any luck   Trying to swap Sol   USDC So I can stake  Might just have to purchase USDC and send it to sollet How are you calculating your APY   Moonlet staking paid 8 39  APY over the past 36 days Please understand that Exodus does not pay 10  annually   Their average for the past 30  days is 8 12    Not saying you shouldn t stake with them  just saying that you might want to know your actual returns https   stakeview appSearch for  Everstake   which is who Exodus stakes with   Click the  All  button for an average of all available data  it s 36 days worth or so Great news Wait until it hit Coinbase Pro om Monday to the moon Yea there has been a few rumors in the last month  When you think about it it makes sense  coin hit top 15 it would be silly for them not to list Solana on Coinbase let s go Very well played        Having me in giggles now Comment from you 29 days ago   130 in 40 days and  460 EOY  Mark my words   Stfu with that crazy price predictions calling me a noob   you made your account last month lmfao How about we get to  45 again  at the least When do we expect the dump starts Lol I just signed up with you  I m gonna give you a go Shinobi Moonlet phone app  11 62 APY atm  No issues so far thank u Done dude I m all in too tis awesome LETS GOOOOOO Thirded I think it s translation for  sell cocaine and go down on people Well seeing as the initial announcement pumped sol from 43 to 51  and back down to 43 as of right now  I d say it hasnt had the big pump yet  But this exactly what happened with ctsi and rlc so far  The news released and they went up  released on CB  Dumped for a day and then they next day or 2 doubled or tripled in price and went back down  but with a higher floorCant say that s exactly how solana will go  But can almost 100  garuntee you that there will be some action to be had in the coming days Wow lucky you i only got in the 40 s but it s going to be wild I second this  I like Exodus wallet a lot Can you show your evidence for that statement   Honest question  I d like to know   I searched but couldn t find anything  but it s a hard subject to search for  lots of noise I didn t sell any of my Solana  but I must admit that before I found out about Polygon I was sometimes an ETH hater  high gas fees etc  you know the speech   But I never believed in the concept of ETH killer  and I don t believe now that ETH Polygon will kill other coins  The market is bound to be shared by different protocols and projects  and it s still very far from being mature  so I think Solana still has a place in it  We just have to revise our assumptions as to how easy it will be to take over transactions  TVL and overall adoption for ETH  because it will be much harder now Awesome news  I wish I got some in the 30s I staked it on Exodus and I am getting around 10  annually Im considering staking my ray and srm stacks in the Raydium LP pair for them  I have no idea if this is a good idea or not though  I have Ray staking on Raydium  Looking for a home for my SRM  Bought  500 of each at  5  Thank god for Exodus Apple Pay BTC and no wait to withdraw Unless you have like 450 Sol don t think you can really do it yet  Hopefully they lower the 1 sol per block price  Don t see why they can t For the price to double  the price just needs to double  There is no need for an additional 12 billion dollars to enter the market  The fact that people continue to argue this and don t understand fundamentally what price and market cap really means on the Solana subreddit is scary for crypto as a whole Did you ever get this sorted out with Exodus   I have the same issues with some Tether and ETH i sent a week ago   When I look at the blockchain  the transactions have been cancelled   I contacted Exodus support and they said it should automatically go back to my wallet   That has not occurred and so far no response from customer support Should have tittle   What does it mean to my heaviest bag Thank the baby Jesus  Been waiting for this one I like this attitude sometimes straight talk with good intention is needed  To be fair though  you should probably stop calling yourself a wanker too Way to not answer his question lmfao Poorly aged comments I m guessing lol Or you can also sell SOL Having the same problem as well  At least good to know its not something on my end Opens thread  Bunch of smooth brains debating market cap instead of talking about banging each other s wives   not sure if good sign  ‍  ‍  ‍ Sso don t fuckint compare SOLbae to aAda      We will pumpWe will Pompae We will Prevail SOLSTICR SUMMER oh i know  it means u can buy sol on coinbase 100B MC   like 496M tokens would be like  200 per sol  10x that 2k per sol at 1T   it s possible but a trillion is probably 10 years away if anatoly and sam execute on solana and serum  and stablecoin regulation becomes clear enough where people can get a mortgage with stablecoin collateral   amp  borrow lending gets big on chain  maybe  lol  i think solana s market cap should be at least  25B if Cardano XRP  amp  Polkadot combine for like  137B  amp  don t have nearly the same traction     25B mc w current supply  thats almost  90 per sol Head on over to the discord   a lot of the team is there and I m sure they d be able to answer your question  Here s a link https   discord gg solana Wish I had 80  If so  I would wait till it gets to 300   totally possible  and I could retire in my country one minimum wage   Enough for me This is wrong in so many level   You don t need  15B for a 2x  the price is dictated by peopls who active trade it   If 90  of token holder is just holding  then the 10  of token supplier dictate what the current price be  so you only need 10  of market cap to effective move the price  And don t forget this 10  supplier doesn t all ask in the same price  they scattered around different price level   It s sad to see idiot like you calling people retard and got upvote Some day sol could be with a T    no right  this is all i want lol  i put in a little during this dip  but i m too ADD to manage my funds daily  i wanna just put in a bunch low  and be rich 5 10 years from now the network will certainly attract developer capital user growth and higher tvl in the medium term  price analysis of the token is a different discussion cause now we re talking market cap of  50B to get to triple digits  are institutions gonna get ready for sol szn  probably not but who knows r ohdongreen Don t listen to this yeah yake noob  he literally don t know how market works  You are much smarter than him the wormhole i think is just the process of bridging assets from erc 20 to spl built by solana  a type of bridge  the metamask sollet bridge is built by the team behind Serum this is my small brain understanding of this  dyor Those were the main ones I ve heard but also feel like nothing can ever be perfect and from a business standpoint SOL is going to succeed IMO i think it s a combination of tribalism in crypto  fair   amp  ptsd from 2017 eth killer narrative  probably some ideological points about decentralization and accessibility in there as well  distribution of tokens  many more i m probably missing lol Give you the wallet address in advance 365shnQk6mEsUTmR8aHJ2jCDWSQLtiZ77y5xGLqQS2WP Cool name though I almost pray for a crypto winter so I can invest for 4  years at a bottom and retire I sent raydium to my sol address at binance accidentally do you think there could be a way to use binance api to send it back it created another address that s own by the sol address unfortunately they want me to pay more then its worth to return and wont give me the private key surely this is an easy task on there end they must have command line Yep Should I buy Bitcoin  Literally you ve been here forever tell me straight up Thanks  If I use Metamask  do I even need the wormhole Serious question  Why don t they like solana gt Go ahead  amp  contact Binance support about that  they arr the one responsible for that SOL wallet  they have its keys  they are the only one able to help you out   Thank you  I contacted them but they said it can t be helped So should Solana holders be afraid of Polygon then I see what you did  you little scallywag Just be sure to keep enough for the tax man    they love them capital gains I have 80 that I got at 1 25 and I ve been mad it s goin up so fast because I was hoping to buying 1000  25 but don t have the money available yet This is the only crypto I truly believe in Yup can confirm this happened to me  took a few hours when I tested with a small deposit but it showed up just fine Yeah it s a good point on dumping   but should be short lived if it happens  Big things to come so all good  Amazing how under the radar SOL is This is it  It works the same on Exodus mobile app too  aamaya I have heard that Exodus charges some fees on the rewards is that true   Have you tried getting the rewards in your main wallet You can always check the fees on binance by clicking on withdraw and enter a random valid address  This will show the fees and then just hit the back button On binance com the withdrawal fees for SOL is 0 02 SOL Welcome to the club bro Same with google Amazon reviews  Idk this is the best that I can think of  I m hoping someone has a better idea yeah  just based on other launches   but it s cool that Sol didn t get shaken out during the crash  so it could be the exception to the ruleif it does dip  that s also normal   this aside  the normie press is just catching on and we ll see something fun this winter It s still in the dip  Coinbase listing may 24th  goes way up Easily 5x soon  Just a huge amount of indie development going on in the Solana ecosystem its crazy This is huge  I hope price runs up in coming months Might get extra love from folks looking to get some quick profit  back Also it s the only new listing   so it gets 100  attention Even 10  commission isn t bad  I don t mind helping pay for costs in running a node  What I don t support is just going with the biggest daddy validators with delegations in the millions  Supporting decentralization Fuck yea people are ready to sell the news   so you have everyone early dumping on coinbase usersthis has shown negative net price action on other projects  which course corrects a few days after the hype It will be right after coinbase pro  they typically list coinbase pro first always and see if the coin has enough volume for coinbase regular for the normies then list it on it and then it takes off No it s not  the circulating supply and who owns what has been the sore issue with Solana u joking Not all of that total stake supply is locked and overlaps with circulating supply accriate Or trade btc for usdc on serum dex  amp  swap for sol on raydium Sometimes  Coinbase is the biggest exchange for Americans so BC there aren t many listings on coinbase compared to Binance or FTX  when there s a new coin it just gets flooded with new money at first Fuckk amazing How tf is a literal press release not news lmao  You just missed the rumor Thank you  So it s still reasonable to assume that a large majority of SOL is currently locked in staking Moved all my ltc to SOL whe it was at  18  Haven t looked back  Staking and hodling I wish the listing is happening during a less chaotic time Yes they re ok  I have it in binance  Exchanges trade in billions  watch some traders on twitch with 10 btc positions  and I guess that s still low among margin and leveraged accounts or spike to 60  amp  range back to 38 wormhole is live  amp  there s a bridge from erc20 to spl using metamask  amp  sollet the mainnet is still in beta  no updates on that look into project serum Solana doesn t use  miners  it s proof of stake  just powerful computers that vote on blocks and get rewards 60 65 70 FTX Use phantom wallet It s confusing  I asked the creators of Solana beach what those two numbers actually mean and they said something about how those two numbers are somehow independent of each other and that there are locked sol in the stake number that aren t considered supply  They admitted it s confusing and also said that the next version of solanabeach will clarify that It s gonna do what all other listings do  Pump  dump  consolidate  then eventually take off  At least that my opinion  But I hope it goes past  100 that would be nice to see Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns The best info You can move SOL to Coinbase Pro now  It ll be available to trade in Monday at 9AM PST What  I already own a lot of Solana 100  coinbase affect incoming FYI  you re failing to account for tradable volume as compared with minted volume  The float is not the same as the entire supply Thank you Solana   looking forward to all the good things Here is my technical view Yeah I would guess they were already in on this  If SBF was involved I would think they knew they d be listing it at some point  This project is very funded Lol 100 Sol added at 36 Expect the dump the day it posts too The normal transaction fee for sending sol is  000005 sol  Not sure if binance us has an additional fee but they would likely show you if so You multiply the price by the number of circulating coins to get the market cap ie  100 coins at  1 means a market cap of  100  If the price of the coins goes to 2  double  the market cap would then be  200  Solana has a price of  45 and a market cap of 12 billion  so for the price to double to  90  12 billion more dollars would need to be added to the market    90 Sol   24 billion market cap Should be basically free Then deposit and sell on the pump and rebuy I was wondering what the transfer fee would be if I wanted to send my sol to my wallet Which wallet  Any wallet that accepts sol should be fine
2021-05-22,38.98837859,40.00957894,31.2548617,it means we need to load our bags  great moment great material to share  thanks grabbbbiinggggg SOL is not yet available on Coinbase com or via our Consumer mobile apps  We will make a separate announcement if and when this support is added https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 I know what you mean The dip is just an opportunity to accumulate  SOL is a long hold  I only see  1 000  SOL and top 5  Even Coinbase listing isn t great news per se  but nice to see further exchange adoption   I d rather it was still low in a way  so I can still accumulate more SOL Very useful information  Thank You  lt 3 ok so maybe they ve secured enough sol to be able to support trading they feel it s a big enough market to support but i don t think new tokens are being minted just to trade on coinbase I should note after all that  sentiment eventually changes  but retail is beaten and battered and whales are comfortable with loaded boats If you re worried about your alts BTC or whatever because you need this to breakeven or 10x by the end of the year it means you re over extended If that s not the case  just understand if you have fundamentally strong coins w  promising futures  ETH  ADA  SOL etc   you will make money whether this year  next  or 2024  If you can find comfort in that  it means you re not overextended and you should just emotionally disconnect from the day to day price action  If you sell at a loss here  there will be a day where you tell people  man I owned X amount of X at X price  and look at it now  If you sell at a loss because you need what s left in your account for rent  etc  Then you should do that  or scale down to what you can afford to emotionally disconnect from Check here  it s in the docs https   spl solana com token example create a non fungible token Seems   phishy This type of behavior in alts is normally the start of a rotation back into BTC  hence BTC looking better while alts bleed  you can see how BTC D has started curling up while other d  alt dominance  and begun descending Does this mean BTC takes off  Who knows  but a lot of ETH money flowed into BTC as well as these other ALTS in the past couple days  You d think that d mean BTC would be higher  but with a dash of leveraged manipulation very easy to scare retail  nearly all BTC bought since about end of February is underwater so very easy to get retail to capitulate their BTC into deeper pockets  Then they rotate their money out of the alts into BTC as well  confusing alt holders and resulting in threads like these  Some alt holders panic sell  others think it s good to rotate into BTC  Then one last BTC fall and retail surrenders to the market altogether Well on the Coinbase press release they said that Solana has to meet their liquidity requirements so I just assumed Thx Solfarm is what you need They are using telecommunications concepts such as this  Founders

  I guess people here are sensible enough to don t fall for these I guess this is as good as a place to ask my question What about buying SOL with RAY  I get an error  Is there a minimum that I have

Coinbase news  Delaying the listing Just got to keep reminding ourselves of the long term gains  All part of the story to 100bn market cap  and hopefully beyond stop selling we have best name marketing faster building ecosystem and now we have the most popular exchange Coinbase i love this project It s the law of crypto  When Bitcoin goes up alts bleed no matter what the fundamentals are Coinbase delayed the listing  It s painful  If you are looking to buy that s good news for you  If you are HODLing  it s painful It s 32 bro Your post has been automatically removed because your

solana  if you have any questions or concerns Pretty easy  on mobile head to the Solana menu and click on the trophy in the upper right corner  On desktop do the same It s obvious  trying to make too much SELL press on SOL so they can buy it as cheap as they can before it goes live trading in Coinbase  when SOL hit Coinbase we may see a good price spike since there will be the USA liquidity trolling for SOL Try to reduce the amount make sure to leave at least 0 1 SOL in your sollet wallet People moving money out of Alts into bitcoin Yes  mostly just did it to verify that it works  Transfer is not a must by any means  but I do know that coinbase wants a certain amount of liquidity on the platform  While I assume SBF Alameda got that handled  I still want to to do my part and show coinbase that there is a market  Of course the main reason for multiple platforms is arbitrage  Most of my SOL is HODL stash but if I see a wild price pop on coinbase it may be tempting to throw a few out to the wolves  It s generally been a little more difficult for Americans to purchase Solana  so opening the market to Coinbase Pro is a pretty big deal I picked some up Bump  i have the same question  Theres so many Sol launchpads coming out but am eager to invest in new projects in the Sol ecosystem My brain is tiny and I don t believe in technical analysis  But the chart says there is massive demand at  30  This dip below 34 doesn t have nearly the volume as the last two  I think it s an excellent buying opportunity I totally understand what you re saying  and I ve bought the dip here myself   but correlations change fast in markets  especially markets that are already fast moving like crypto  SOL could be back to moving in lockstep with BTC tomorrow Now that makes sense https   twitter com CoinbasePro status 1395939105947725834 s 19Buy the dip no question Coinbase listing delayed Hi  I assume that you transfer SOL to coinbase in preperation for its listing on May 24th  May I ask what are the benefit of transfering it to Coinbase compare to keeping it in other platform like FTX and Binance  I know that there s a different in price between exchange platforms  But is it that big of a difference that transferring is an absolute must  I am asking since I m not in the U S  and my country isn t supported on Coinbase yet  Thank you in advance I think you are fundamentally misunderstanding my point  but that s fine  I won t try to convince you Don t get me wrong  if I had any dry powder left I would buy this dip  It does seem odd to me that it s dropping when BTC is going up  All alt coins that I follow have been tracking btc price over past few days No you have reasons most of the time  If you do not know yourself maybe someone out there does and you should not claim that the reason is due to randomness with high certainty when you have no idea  If it is then great   it s time to buy  if there is something fundamentally damaging that occurred then I need to know before assuming it its random Anyone know if it s possible to buy SOL with RAY on raydium Like is there a minimum needed that isn t disclosed  I keep getting an errorI have 0 0222 SOL in my sollet and 0 98 RAY  I m trying to turn that RAY into SOL This price behavior isn t  odd  at all  It s perfectly in line with SOL s historical realized volatility Correct  Not a blockchain congestion more a website access problem to handle enough users in parallel With all due respect  I disagree  SOL is tanking right now  the price behaviour is very odd   some people know something Stop pumping Just weird that it happened suddenly  Wondering if there was a catalyst or I m looking at a buying opportunity  Don t want to rush in Alts are bleeding hard  Delayed coinbase listing shaking the tree harder Could have something to do with btc tanking much harder in the past week than sol and the fact that sol is up 30  against btc in the past month Usually there is a catalyst like a breaking source of news for something like this  I m trying to find information before buying the dip Just keep buying boys SOL reached 32 for the first time on about April 21  Almost exactly a month ago  On that day Bitcoin was worth  54k  At the time I m typing this Sol is around 32 50 and bitcoin  38k  So despite what s happened in the past couple hours Sol is up 30  against bitcoin in the past month  It does suck that a months worth of gains have been wiped out  But imo they have been wiped out due mostly to btc price action and fud See here  https   www reddit com r solana comments ninfot with _btc _going _up _anyone _know _why _we _are _crashing gz2qhs9  context 3 Yea can positiv in and of the day but i dont think that coinbase can rise the price that much Yea can positiv in and of the day but i dont think that coinbase can rise the price that much While the price of Bitcoin is going up  Bitcoin dominance is also increasing which means a lower market share for alts Mhmm i got all in at 4 dollar Any ideas on the range of pump then dump  Might try n sell a little near the top and buy back in on the dump  Would love to try bring the DCA down a bit after this spanking we have taken Perhaps the fee  But uniswap on matic is very cheap also Proof of History is just the name Solana gave to its consensus mechanism  it s actually PoS  PoH is not a consensus mechanism  Maybe that s why they phrased it like that Haha I did the same thing to see if I would get one  It showed up but it s shit quality  different color  and the design was off I bought one  Ill let yall know if it comes Once sufficient supply of SOL is established on the platform  trading on our SOL USD  SOL BTC  SOL EUR  SOL GBP  and SOL USDT order books will launch in three phases  post only  limit only and full trading  If at any point one of the new order books does not meet our assessment for a healthy and orderly market  we may keep the book in one state for a longer period of time or suspend trading as per our Trading Rules   from https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 I don t say this with any attitude whatsoever  so please don t interpret it that way  but nobody is ever going to be able to accurately answer this sort of question  no matter the day and no matter the situation  Any answer you get from anyone about  why  something is going up or down on a particular day will be guesswork  at best  99  of the time  Markets go where they go  Especially on shorter time frames  there s going to be a lot of random variance  Remember a couple weeks back when BTC and all the major cryptos crashed a bunch and SOL bucked the trend and went up a bunch  Same thing  just in reverse  Anybody who professed to know  why  that was happening was just guessing Not that  we were at  37 38 when bitcoin was about 36kish  Bitcoin rallied up to 38kish earlier but instead of going up we went down to sub 33  Did something significant happen  Seems odd  Maybe coinbase delay got people selling off FTX US doesn t onboard personal accounts from NY  Maybe I could use it same way as KuCoin  Don t verify and then just sent funds from Coinbase  I thought it was KYC only Googled and I see I could use it without verifying as long as I never withdraw more than  1k so I could buy under that then send it to my ledger  That might be great easy option for now  I ll look into it thanks Larger cap coins with more bulls will usually bounce back before the mid caps Agreed  post this on the dev forum Is it because they are increasing supply to go on Coinbase Monday Its crypto the main thing is once it s sent its unrecoverable  That s why you copy and paste the address never type it out individually Sorry hope it wasn t a major loss Better watch bitcoin charts    headed for another fast drop Someone told me that but when I was trying to send SOL out of hotbit it wanted to charge me one SOL  It said that was based on blockchain prices not there fees  One SOL was a lot more than I expected since others say it s cheap but maybe hotbit was scamming and adding their withdrawal fees into it Wish I had waited another week to buy in  fomo was real Just bought around 3 for 32 6    nice This should be the standard for those just now tuning in   probably  30 to 40  then wiped off the board in 48hrs  Patience is a virtue Yup sounds like you had the right idea  You should ask in the serum discord under the sollet tab  https   discord gg PJHmFVwnAlso I know it sounds odd  and what you tried to do should work  but I ve heard of people using ftx or ftx us for this since they handle both spl and erc20 usdc so well  You just send  from sollet to your ftx and then from ftx to your metamask  Ftx sends the correct version automatically based on wallet address I think hope they meant it in the 1st case definition  And it was truly just a poor choice in words  The tech is real and it is working  https   www merriam webster com dictionary so called You can use the moonlet wallet  It s mainly a Zilliqa and Solana wallet  You re able to select with validator you wish to stake with etc was wondering why my deposit address was never generated on the account asset depreciation  smart contract rug Yes  in the  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  wallet  when you click on an asset you have the option to  receive  or  send   I wanted to send  If you click send  you have two tabs  1 is for  SPL USDC  and the other is for  ERC20 USDC   I assumed since I was sending to use for ETH transactions I should send on the Etherium mainnet and send via  ERC20 USDC  option Yes and no  Coinbase Pro is their exchange more geared towards trading  they report their volume on coinbase pro to sites like coinmarketcap and coingecko while standing coinbase isn t really geared towards trading  You can log into coinbase pro with your log in information for standard coinbase Yes Be careful of the initial pullback  It will spike and then profit taking  catch it on the way back down Fees are very small for SOL  That s one of Its benefits over ETH I buy in FTX US and transfer to my solflare wallet and stake There is FTX and FTX US Also why were you doing this just curious  You wanted to use it in eth defi So you had it connected to your metamask right Thanks for your comprehensive reply    I m excited to use Serum now I live in NY  I tried to use FXT and it says not in my country  Again I guess I could use VPN but don t want to risk loggin on one day without it  I guess I will do the Sollet wallet process  It just sounds like a lot of steps and I m new to all this but guess no easy way to get SOL for some of us  Then I will send it from that wallet to my ledger and hope I don t lose half of it to gas fees along the way Who the f is selling at  33   I wish I had more money I thought I heard the Coinbase Pro debut was delayed  Either way still a good buy at  30 or  50 if you wait Do you try  binance  https   www binance com en register ref L8U10Q2   The number 1 world exchange and people panic selling Coinbase pro   SOL USD is in Cancel Only mode There are risks involved with Yield farming  from impermanent loss to smart contract hacks  or even bug within the codes They said it s just some RPC problem  couldn t handle the load of people during the IDOs at the same time  By seeing Solana Discord  they already opened an  rpc channel for people willing to provide such service  so yeah  they are aware of this load  amp  trying to solve it  amp  making sure not to happen again It s a  time stamp  that differentiates transactions on the blockchain  Similar to the technology that helps cell towers keep transmissions from scrambling with each other  It s a key component to Solana and is the reason that the network can handle upwards of 50 000 transactions per second Screenshot please so i ban him Here is the straight forward answer  Yellow marked  to the   Risks Of Yield Farming   https   changenow io blog yield farming risks     text Yield 20farming 20involves 20supplying 20your loss 20of 20your 20cryptocurrency 20asset It should arrive   wait a few hrs and check back  Same thing happens to SRM that I sent I hear from Serum and Raydium IDOs  sol blockchain congested   Do you have source Delayed I m a bit bummed so many people are staking  6  is nothing Listing is delayed so don t expect anything to happen If it dips again I will buy again Thanks for your opinion  that does make a lot of sense  I am not really an active trader  that s why I can t really follow all of these micro mechanics which are a huge factor in crypto apparently FTX us Some generous soul sold their SOL to me for 34 8 I m new to solana and reading this exact phrasing yesterday made me a little skeptical about it  What s wrong with proof of history Very true but the manipulation is kind of good for the long run buy the dips lower your average cause you know in the long run it ll be worth it Just a good buying opportunity I bought in at 40 let s see what is up with it next 13 discount  Love this project and I definitely have some but I think we ll get a lower price And came elon and china and destroyed us all You re gonna lose money thinking like that  Charts aren t perfect but price is the arbiter of success or failure at the end of the day i didn t realize it was state by state  ty for explaining Binance US isn t available in NY  And I don t want to use VPN for regular Binance and risk logging on without it on and being told I have to remove all my funds  I wish kucoin had sol  I bought it in the  20 s on hotbit and then sold in  40 s cause I wanted out of hotbit  lost trust in it   Thought I would go thru trouble of buying Sol another way but didn t get around to it  I didn t have my ledger at the time but if I did I would have just transferred the SOL to the ledge  Oh well one day I ll buy again Binance isn t available everywhere This really does need to be addressed  Cardano s solution for this seems to be working  No need to reinvent the wheel Its still  37 ish  so where is the 50 Just hold fire guys  Save some powder cos I think more red candles are due  Not trying to fud just saying save some powder is there a reason you d avoid binance as an alternative You re the scammer  You DMed me with a fake Metamask support form that asks for my seed phrase  Nice try scammer Notice they already have 18 billion transactions  This is the fastest growing network in blockchain  So Hedera just passed ETH in transaction volume and most in media would not know this  Solana is more than 10X that number how is this divergence possible   amp  x200B Is this a function of the POH protocol From which platform did you send it from  Let us know so it helps the community to be vigilant while using the platform May 18th  around noon  EST   ATH  56 82 When did it hit 50 usd You can stake SolFlare with a cold wallet  and it helps keep everything decentralized by spreading out validators instead of sinking everything into one giant pool I was waiting for this so I didn t have to deal with Sollet wallet and serum and something else but maybe I ll just go that route after all because who knows the price it will be by the time Coinbase pro gets it  Also I m in NY so not even sure it will be available in my region I was waiting for listing to see since I couldn t find what regions it would or wouldn t be available in  A lot of listings aren t available in NY  Thanks for posting this I wasn t aware it was postponed Scam So called proof of history  interesting word choice Use all of them  I like the trading tab  at raydium io  it s another gui for the Serum dex I am glad you liked it We as rnhkk amp  Iwlwg It costs that much to set up a small  mining rig  Price doesn t seem too bad Love It I m just waiting  I have a btc sol eth buy order  Gonna scoop up the deals Tits up Coinbase betrayal once again 1000 is a good number How could 100 times better project to be valued 200 times less  Its not about Ethereum Solana difference it s the same as bitcoin cash   bitcoin  In my opinion if people realise what a bullshit is bitcoin and so unusable they will move out to somewhere else  It s a matter of time  Solana to be the leader for modern crypto  And bitcoin cash to be the leader in the trading world U dont lose if ya dont sell Discount or no discount   we HODL Ye thats when I am like fuck this shit  People say ayo buy the dip my guyNAH fuck that shit I am down major league but I am just gonna HODL Much less than both  but still just enough  Which is a good compromise  IMO  But really  just buy eth  and  sol Yeah sorry  its 10 4  in one year  Every 3 or so days you get a small cut of that 10 4 Do you mean 2024 Thank you  Not entirely sure how the exchange allows for purchase but they re in the process of adding wallet functions Appreciate the post of technical problem   forget about the price  Soon maybe a few month  things go back to normal just like this pandemic If you plan to hodl long term  then it s good to stake  But if you don t stake  that means your returns come from price appreciation only If you plan to trade short term  then don t stake https   raydium io farms Here goes my whole thesis away Yeah  I am aware of the pros and cons of the many programming languages I write in  Building frontends in rust while the web runs mainly on javascript is not going to be fun  Building on solana  rust will be fine Getting downvoted but it s true Fuckint SOL is such a bad bitch  ‍  ‍ Do you have any idea how safe and secure Rust is  and how specifically integral it is to the foundation and function of Solana s system   It s like you re saying to go to a country where they only speak their native tongue   but the guards  at the border  somewhat speak your native tongue   But yeah learning their language is still a good idea  ‍  ‍  ‍  ‍  ‍ Oh yeah and why is this strategy so good  And tel me how it s safer than my crypto being in exodus with only myself owning the keys Hell yeah  Love this channel it s got incredible quality of information  and tons of SOLANA Porn  ‍ You get 8 07  every year  not 10 4  every 3 days   Exodus stakes with Everstake who pays 8 07  APY averaged over the past 36 days I m actually a little surprised that this allowed you to do this with a missing digit versus the wrong digit Generally most wallets at least check that the address conforms to an expected structure and missing a digit would fail that check In any case if the transaction was processed you can not recover the funds This original report  here  https   solana com solana security audit 2019 pdf  discusses some of the use cases and situations in which an attack could be attemptedNote that this report is about 18 months old at this point so the number of validator and scale of the attack surface has changed 10 28  on Exodus How decentralized is it actually  In comparison to BTC and ETH exactly  all those guis get a   of the fees generated by trades on their front end  this is supposed to incentivize development of the best interface  btw mango markets is running with leverage trading on wrapped btc  amp  wrapped eth so if you re having trouble you should hit up the discord Definitely not losing out  Take a look at the SOLANA price action  The 8 10  staking reward does not compensate enough to bear the risks  You could accumulate much more just simply trading If you dont have time or interest to do any trading i would recommend just holding and staking  SOL has only 2 5 days to withdraw from staking  but still if markets crash its too late   I stake majority of my SOL The Defiant is doing well i mean if you built something people want to use  there s nothing wrong with profiting from that with a ref link Never posted on Reddit before  Optimistic about Solana  but this article is dumb it s not the same thing you have to make a separate account specifically for cbp Yeah I just saw  I got myself a Sollet wallet  going to study these wallets and see what s missing ha Oh interesting  I really like their UI  Would love to have a swap integration with SOL in there Awesome  I ll take a look tonight Yeah we heading for 20k baby  time to buy the fire sale Applied at your Notion posting It s probably a little disadvantageous to just hold without staking  Reason is that the inflation rate is currently about 8  per year as the system matures  It will level off eventually  but the idea is that staking is supposed to allow people to break even during this period I believe Exodus wallet automatically gives you  8 9  growth without staking  You could also look into Defi activity with something like Raydium   It sure how that works with your laws though  In fact  I m not sure how one could technically purchase SOL without any transactions  unless your exchange is keeping it all in one bucket or something https   docs solana com inflation inflation_schedule Did you manually type an address in or something  Most exchanges have a copy button to prevent issues like this Not yet   Buying more wherever it lands Yes   There is gonna be another fall out  Bitcoin is prime  Set your stop limits Same I bought at 59 to have it drop 38 the next day How much  SOL is good enough to have Yes Could be for the best to keep release when things are more bullish I read coinbase Pro  which I guess is the same thing I just saw they updated about having delays   ‍ ️https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 Sadly  no support for SOL staking there yet Solana will be available to trade on Coinbase starting Mon  5 24 I think only pro is announced so far  but hoping for more major adoption  With the volume it s done the last couple of days  everyone will probably want in soon Mercurial finance will do this  their IDO was today Get a phantom wallet m  use the save address feature Is it just Coinbase Pro or they also listing it on Coinbase Wish they had it on coinbase or gemini Understand that regardless of tech  we are all subject to movements of BTC  I d wait a bit til we see a bottom hopefully  30k region Damn that sucks That s bad  better luck next time I downloaded Telegram to participate in the solstarter whitelist  Was scammed out ot 2 ETH today  There was a timer showing the pool closed in 10 min so I rushed and didnt verify Title says it all  Love solana and defi  This is the best feeling chain to use  Anywhere good to yield stables or 2 stables  Thanks unfortunately that doesn t work with my buying technique i follow the pattern   buy high  price drop   HOLD Yeah they are not accurate   They are just inflating their numbers  most of these front ends do that   The actual value is 8 39 A stake account is like any other account in Solana and thus you either a  Keep your balance above a rent exempt minimum  orb  Pay rentMost people do  not  want to pay rent  which would be SOL paid every single epoch just to retain the account   So most people for most purposes always create accounts with  at least the rent exempt minimum  That means that to create a stake account  you must put at least 0 00228288 SOL into it to satisfy the rent exempt minimum However  none of that earns rewards for stake   Only the SOL in an account above and beyond the rent exempt minimum earns rewards Therefore     gt  The minimum you can  stake  is 0 00228288 SOL    gt  And at that minimum you will earn 0The minimum you can stake to actually earn rewards is  002282881 SOLAnd then you will earn rewards on 0 000000001 SOL So yes  you can stake  100 worth  which is much more than the rent exempt minimum APR on Everstake is 8 12  over the past month   This is a fact that is verifiable  not whatever smoke they are blowing on their website Don t stake Exodus   They stake only with Everstake  they do not spread stake  and Everstake is already overweight and has mediocre performance Solflare allows you to select multiple other validators  I recommend a strategy that does not put all your stake in one validator You cant
2021-05-23,31.22576685,32.43626905,19.13983901,Did they just dump on us The underlying question is how you value a crypto currency   A traditional value investor can t use free cash flows with Solana or any other crypto   This is a pure growth play  investment  in the Solana ecosystem   Most investors view BTC and SOL as completely different animals   You could also argue is valued RELATIVE to other blockchain technologies and when the technology as a whole gets battered  so does Solana Any time a government has ever tried to ban something  the value inevitably goes up   Humans are human Yeah  And it was shortly after Bitcoin debuted  similar timeline to Sol right now  Bitcoin jumped to like 80 or 90 dollars and everyone couldn t believe it  When it crashed back to like 30 40  all the bears came out to tell the young crypto crushers that they were stupid  How dumb it was to think the idea of digital decentralized self regulating currency would take off   then like 6 months later it hit 1k Agree  I want to learn about the Solana ecosystem and the technicals   Memes are a pathway to Doge status What about this dip reminds yo of that  Because it dipped like 60 Update  Finally got my Solana out of my Solflare wallet  Just keep trying is all I can say  It randomly worked  I d also like to note that I was using Google Chrome and the time it finally worked I approved the Ledger to connect after a notification popped up from the  View site information  little lock icon to the left of the url address bar  Hope this helps someone  Not putting any more Sol back in Solflare  of

Sollet charges 0 002039 SOL to add a new token Yeah  just look at the price of Quickswap s QUICK The lowest it went was  20 79 that s where I bought some I wouldn t peg that to Solana specifically   The whole market went from 2 5T to 1 5T and through a lot of it SOL held its value till the end   The market appears to be a 9T  opportunity based on what lending looks like in traditional markets aloneI ve been trading and hodling since 2017  meaning I did very well with Ethereum  and that s lost half its value in the crash and is still one of the better things to hold   I m not terribly concerned about the short termNot to toot my own horn here  I mean buying solid projects with good developer enthusiasm and solid fundamentals is a long game i feel its far more  new  than  fragile

the sanest sub in the cryptosphere Decentralized HODLbot  Sign me up No disrespect to SBF  but it sounds like defi on Solana is quite fragile  I hope more transparent open source AMMs are in the

SBF and Solana s reputation  SBF knows the RAY team and has shilled it multiple times on Twitter  RAY is also the most used dapp on Solana for retail by far  RAY doing a rug pull would be catastrophic for Solana s future Light speed   You have any documentIon to back that up Shoot  I forgot I buy sol at Binance US  I buy other stuff at Coinbase pro But I thought the Sol sale was deferred there Coinbase pro Who knows    in this moment it s a big risk put money on alts   but i believe in the project and i think long term    i believe in crypto and i believe in solana s project Is it going to dip more or should I buy now Looks like you were right  You saw right through everything  I didn t get in until  30 and I didn t know it was being pumped up You may tag the mods Where do you buy It was always the game plan anyway Too many posts asking same question This is one of the few subs where under the welcome info there is no tutorial how to buy Sol  for those of us in states like NY with no exchanges available to us that Sol is sold on   Considering Sol is available on so few exchanges I m surprised this is not in the welcome info like many other crypto subs  I posted and asked but it was general answers given no real tutorial steps I could follow or even follow up on  I was told Sollet   gt  Serum   gt  Raydium  I know Sollet is wallet but no idea the rest so I googled hoping for youtube but nope  So if that is popular way to get Sol not one person made a video on it I m not asking again cause I don t want to post same questions but  How to Buy Sol  would be a nice addition to this sub Snap  it got that low Use Exodus wallet to swap with a vpnCost u 10 USD Same  bought a week ago at 40  Know it will go up  but could have almost bought twice as much if I bought now Hell yeah it has potential   Its the Uniswap of Solana Your 2013 16 core xeon is too slow  it s probably slower than a Macbook Air Usd 19 euros Is there any incentive to help meet the threshold by moving to coinbase wallet My x99 build from 2013 is currently running a 16 core xeon and 128 gb of ecc ram  I bet the vast majority rent because they are clueless about building PCs  You can parts from a couple years ago for real cheap besides the graphics cards right now  The bigger issue is having enough upload speed to run your own box at your house Bull run is over start thinking long term investment now I ve noticed this as well  Here and in other sub reddits  Unfortunately the bigger these projects get the more that will happen  The real discussions are still out there but you just have to search a little harder Same I m in at  39 and basically lost half this week  Holding forever because it will hit  100 this summer SAME  I m trying hard to figure out how to buy it so I can start buying on the way to the bottom but I live in NY and limited in buying options  Not even sure once Coinbase gets it if it will be available to NY residents This is a very random question  The answer is very likely  If you d knew what the price would do  the price would be at that point already    Solana is good tech  but it could very easily be decimated by 90  from this point  Or it could not  The entire market goes down and Solana will go down with it  And it will rise with it too    The only meaningful speculation you can do is long term Maybe I can do this if I can use FTX US without KYC because I m in NY  FTX US fees high to transfer out Nope I guess is going to be a wonky ride but when bulls are back Solana is going to explode Nice  the first time I bought it was  14 Yes every crypto I use follow has price talk banned and have a trader forum for that I e  monero  xmr trader waiting beat R 16 Same   Increased my position by 32  crypto is on sale Bro    Solana is capable of light speed  They re currently getting all the optic wiring lines in the oceans  No one will be faster than solana SOL is down because selling pressure is exceeding buying pressure  This is also why BTC is down  This is also why every publicly traded asset of any kind  ever in the long history of publicly traded assets  goes down  or up  in the opposite scenario  Fundamentals do not drive  short term  market moves in  any  public market  crypto or otherwise  On short time horizons  supply demand and liquidity drive markets  This isn t SOL or crypto specific  It s how all publicly traded markets work and have always worked Great thing is  if you re into SOL for the tech and the long term potential  you don t have to worry about any of this  You don t need to figure out  reasons  for moves  which is all hindsight and confirmation bias anyway   You don t need to try and pick bottoms  which is a matter of luck and nothing else  All you ve gotta do is control your position size  make sure you re not overextended  maybe buy more if you ve got dry powder and it s within your position size limits  and then not worry about any of this The the dip dips      happens to me all the time Solana is going to be massive im not even worried Proud of you  lt 3 Isn t it also worth saying  if you re betting on the majority of your knowledge and discussion about SOL to be from its subreddit  meaning only the posts that you say this sub used to have   should take a step back and think is this really where the best bang for my buck     Reddit is a perfect blend of great knowledge and early adoption discussion     dknt really think one hurt the other And cent complain about coinbase listing considering it just started being a thing  Will go awayEither way  SOL is goat Damn  low key facts I bought the dip at 22  Crypto is a dumpster fire rn but I m not planning on selling anytime at least until 2022 so im okay with it I didn t   I added RAY to sollet  didn t send an order with max sol  only third  and it didn t go through  I noticed on the sollet window there were like five or six boxes or actions it had to do for the transaction  didn t play close attention to what each was but I suspect that was the problem  Im just not going to use raydium io and stake my sol  Maybe I ll try again some other time I think price discussions should be straight out banned here  Ethereum has its r ethtrader for price speculation and pseudo objective takes on whether the price will rise or not  and r ethereum for everything else  We should do the same  some sort of r solanatraders for price discussion  While r Solana is for discussion on the tech  applications  etc Or whales manipulating the market  more likely  Maybe they were mad they lost so much on GME and decided to recoup it with btc Yeah decentralised  Where you have to raise a Pull Request in github to name your token which is approved by somebody Whatever it is I m hodling Solana is one of the few that truly peaked my interest With all due respect   5 cents is quite a statement considering the amount of support lines going down that way  So if you re gonna type that and hit send  Back up your thought with sound information I hope this price manipulation will end soon Yeah I m in at like  39 your good I m very happy yes  SOL will be around for a while  We have a strong  growing community committed to development It got to 19 at some point today lol Also waiting to hear it tbh  Considering what price predictions we ve seen about the Coinbase listing happening from tomorrow which may take the price higher Too many weak hands panic selling Hope your right   hope sushi joins the moon shot Didn t age well About 38  is what we get to trade  I guess your number is right  But I dunno  I could be wrong  Anyway  as far as OP has correctly pointed out  the number of posts on when SOL would reach 100   are too damn high  People who have invested in SOL when it reached ATH are the ones experiencing this FUD  like me   Otherwise looking at the chart it still is on a bullish run  From Dec 20 to date Sorry but while that tech is great  the real reason Solana has low fees is a combination of low current usage and high validator node hardware requirements  You can t run one on a consumer laptop like you can with Bitcoin and Ethereum People  particular first time investors are confirmation bias addicts  Once you realize nobody has a crystal ball or that Ta doesn t include enough data about black swan or large whale activity you stop asking the same question  Buy low sell high  HODL  that s it folks  Diamond hands not paper hands Good point If it becomes a real competitor to ETH it won t matter  just hold it This can easily become a long crypto winter  Buy the discount if you want but remember to pace yourself You can stake on Binance with 10  APY Thanks man  I think HODL is best solution right now Bitcoin was at like 90 bucks  lost half its value  big money laughed and declared crypto dead  the fed was threatening restrictions  The price stayed low for a month or two  then exploded No chances are zero   I ll bet 2 banano on it Isn t more than 60  of the circulating supply owned by the foundation creators Fees are low  But you can look at number of products being built on Solana  number of new products being announced and also with hackathon  I expect hundreds more It has to prove a lot more but by real product I mean it s regularly adding stuff and not shouting about it and kept growing  In every solana newsletter  I see many new partnerships which are just simply mentioned there without making a huge deal about every single one of them Newbie here    So what was the 09  Bitcoin dip all about  ️ gt Solana has grown because it s a real product  That s what everyone needs to remember  There was never a big marketing push and it kept growing This is not really true  How much has Solana captured in fees the 14 months the mainnet has been around  99   of Solana s valuation is speculation on it s future growth  There are definitely a number of more speculative tokens  but I don t think it s accurate to say it s grown because it s a real product 5 cents   Explain your technical analysis at 5 cents   Gonna make a statement like that back it up  My ears are wide open Thank you 100   Hmm  Dont be surprised if it soared to 200 on the next day or more  even for a split second   Like icp hit 750  Look at icp chart The pump will be determined by the steam build up prior    if it hits the ground running and people are scurrying to make up lost profit from this last week   no telling I ve seen when you try use the words from Exodus on a Ledger nano non of the paths show the same address  However these apps all use math there is no way it can work one way today and then never give that address again see if you can get hold of sollet support maybe there s a bug and that issue can be easily resolved The coinbase listing will pump SOL to  100 Rocketship emoji s  sJokes aside if I had one alt to bet on and I dont consider ETH an alt it would be SOL How likely is it to dip below 20 Nah I ve tried sollet  phantom  exodus and mathwallet  I ve been in the space since 2015 I m pretty knowledgeable  This is just the first time I ve seen funds just disappear like this  Anyways it s what ever at this point  Just unfortunate I agree You lose all the coin you leveraged  It s trading on margin  not spot No offense   but your argument is absolutely naive  Seriously   you are gonna have to reset your thought process on how all this works  You are with your significant other  they want to spend a weekend with a past lover in a beach resort  Promises no sex but sharing the same bed  You say  Have a great time  You completely believe they wont hook up It s only on leveraged positions I have nothing against memes or speculation  To each their own My only thought is everytime someone sees price is dipping  they come and post here  And same is for every event like coinbase listing  I want to be helpful and answer questions but same question 100 times doesn t help Also as someone said  it might help to keep a daily thread for such things Flip the dip But he s got a point too  every person ahs his portfolio bleeding comes in  amp  make a thread about it  it will be just boring with 0 add to this subreddit we know the market is so bad right now  we don t have to be reminded of this every day  10 time a day Up or down Try your seed words in other solana wallets like the moonlet app  If you are still not seeing that address you sent to after checking all paths then maybe you have more than one wallet and you re looking at the wrong one or you somehow ended up on a fake version of the website  I can t find a fake version of sollet io using any search engine but I have seen a fake website for Solflare My only regret is buying my whole load at 35 and not at the 20 15 area  Sol is the future Didn t own any sol until this weekend and I m buying big  Great opportunity ️ ️ ️ yeah bitcoin going to 28 I m thinking of buying some  You think it ll go down some more or should I just buy now Dude  It s Reddit  The Mecca of meme stock pump and dump get rich quick communities  Look at every other crypto related sub it s the same or worse If you re coming to Reddit learn about Solana or any crypto you re gonna sift through a lot of people trying to turn  100 into  10k  Asking beginner questions etc  The value in this and most finance reddit subs is exactly that  To see what that beginners are murmuring about  what technical issues they re experiencing  what questions they re repetitiously asking  In that vein  this comment and your post are just the same noise you re commenting on Well said  we all know it s bad to loose money  amp  or your portfolio goes down  but it doesn t need to open a thread about it ever time this happens lol Solana is here to stay  amp  to be part of crypto  so people having hard time watching their portfolio on daily basis  just forgot about it couple months and you ll se the green again There are alot of people happy  The happy ones are the people that zoom out and see the big picture  They understand Wyckoff distribution  They follow bitcoins chart as it ebbs and flows through the Wyckoff pattern  We are all puppets  ever since the stock market was created this has been happening   There are warnings signs   alot of them  bitcoin is the first culprit  Then follow your own investment charts  candles  macd 7  20  55  99 those lines actually are saying something  Some of the best advice i read on here was to keep a chunk of money in a stable coin  usdc   whatever your preference and have it ready for times exactly like this  If you follow your charts you ll know what a ridiculously phenomenal buy in would be  Then have a stop limit in play   You know if it hits its instant gains  It takes a lot of time and experience to go through these manipulated patterns  If you catch on to the game  times like today and last Sunday are what you ve been waiting for all year long  I thought last week when sol was trading for  48 and going on coinbase  that I was being ridiculous for putting a stop order in at  25    26   27 50 BEFORE THE COINBASE LISTING TOMORROW   Well I was absolutely wrong   I could have bought at  21 50 and possibly  16   18 when bitcoin finally drops to 28k  Alas  my load was spent on my stop limits  I can live with it cause I picked up 150 additional Sol tokens for free  I cant beat myself up  I did know that bitcoin hasnt shot its load yet and should have cxl those stop orders  but it was 4am and I was wanting to get back to bed  I think Sol will take off and clean up alot of red for a lot of folks  Let s see what coinbase will do    sky is the limit  Cheers Would be nice if there was just a main daily weekly thread where those questions could be comments rather than posts Stake your SOL while you wait  ️ earn on the way up again Yes Sol is going down big time gonna hit 5 cents lots more pain to come yes No Yes Watch it grow  Your optimistic No it s not  Read coinbase blog post For some reason they didn t add another tweet It s suspended as of now Or ever     that s just straight gambling as prices aren t correlated with the tech Can someone explain what this means The terms like  liquidate  make me think this more than just losing value   did you lose coins Does this have to do with staking Trading will be tomorrow  May 24 https   twitter com CoinbasePro status 1395424443749502986  https   twitter com CoinbasePro status 1395424443749502986  gt  Starting today  inbound transfers for SOL are now available in the regions where trading is supported  Traders cannot place orders and no orders will be filled  Trading will begin on or after 9AM PT on Monday May 24  if liquidity conditions are met It s shocking to me how many people thought the first big dip was it  We re in for a long winter At the rate of all coins stability charts  Nothing is holding value  I m assuming we will continue dropping for a few weeks before we see a floor then a few weeks till it moves in some direction  positive or negative   many investors will jump back on BTC first before moving to risky coins Hope it goes lower  i need to buy more No it s just not a method that can prove consensus  Solana does prove consensus  as every crypto blockchain does  through  proof of stake  or PoS PoH is used for something else besides consensus  there s write ups about it if you search for it It is often said that cats have nine lives but that is really just a myth I was DCA ing 37 29    Maybe I am not good enough at catching the falling knife haha Thanks man  hope the price wont go as the 1st scenario haha oh Hi Dad bot  I am scared The chances of it going to  15 in a month is unknown but could happen The chances of it going to  4500 in 3 years is also unknown but could happenJust hodl if you don t need that money for rent or necessities  This is coming from someone who lost 90  in 2018 by buying ath  Then holding and gaining 800  by 2021 Hi all in for sol  I m dad Yeah I can see  100 anymore I think we are having a further correction  maybe though you never know still only May so a long time to go for the market to change around and SOL to go pick up traction later in the year  I m Hodl either way home until at least  500 I am all in for SOL  and was DCA ing from 49 35 and now 29 Tbh i am little sacred when price continuing going down  D did you figure this out   I did the same recently and came across a few error messages that were not exactly clear on Raydium   One tough one to solve was that you have to add the RAY token to your wallet before you actually swap  it costs a bit of SOL to do this   amp  x200B I remember the error message on Raydium that appeared because of this was completely unrelated  I just don t remember if it was a  transaction too large  error 15 dollar It looks like StableSwap will bring this exact thing https   github com stableswap stable swap program Was just coming in here looking for answers  I am out of money to buy the dip but at 29 USD its a screaming buy SOLSTICE SUMMER Fam I bout so many at 50 Wouldn t the correct corresponding path show the address in which the funds were first sent though  That address doesn t exist anymore out of the 30 I ve got on the 3 diff deriv paths   strange Click each path   it says 0 but click  amp  load up each path manually  your coins are still there ive restored my sollet wallet many times IMO solanium is better project than solstarter simply because it s not super hyped  so it could be undervalue after launch  Project like Mercurial is also undervalue simply because it launch in  Bear Market Thanks for sharing You make some valid points in general  But I think the reason this thread started was due to the unusual price behaviour of SOL over previous few hours  That got me searching for news  turns out coinbase listing delayed  That s all Alts holders are moving to BTC to lessen the crash  People are also mostly buying BTC first at bottom Coinbase listing delayed  not sure if you saw that I just did this but can t even access the wallet through the seed words now Having the same issue Dude this seems to be a new common issue   my seed when restored in sollet just shows zero balance   checked all paths and everything  funds literally vanished Didnt age well All paths have zero balance value  The original address I sent my Solana to from my binance doesn t even exist under the private key anymore   my tokens are still showing on the explorer but just can t even seem to access the wallet it s kinda weird when you restore it but if you pick the right one your balances are there try restoring again selecting a different path No worries There u go mr My bad   I didn t mean to This sentiment never made sense to me  how does knowing someone had crpyto or not or how much  increAse the capability to hack them or not   It s safe to assume every fucking person has at least some if they re in one of those subs  but you re saying g that if someone is wearing a T shirt or if they poet about getting more in their bag  then hackers will target them and hack them   I m sorry man but shit judt doesn t work that way  Everyone should always be smart about their privacy  but a damn t shirt is not the straw  That broke the camels back Why did you downvote me ️ To buy back more at  26 how has no one fixed this  why is this wallet creating new addresses with an old seed  what a shit user experience    no devs no comments just funds are gone  great job LMAO  no one figured this out   having the same issue   what a garbage wallet   funds are safu though right Get out Binance us yas great metrics fir solana like those  the ema  macd  volume oscillator  and others Blessings  Appreciate you It s just a flag that says  I have something of value  come hack me Ofc Thanks for the info  So then are valid consensus mechanisms predefined and all exist in cryptography or something  Since you said PoH is not a consensus mechanism  I m wondering what qualifies one to be Totally not a scam  send me 1000 sol and I will send you 2x back seriously though how do idiots fall for that Haha all good   enjoy Is that what the price dropped lol Can t find this anywhere what do you mean about automated market makers   they re obviously already running on ETH  you just mean the quotes are less delayed I d like to know the source too  I haven t heard anything about it I can send you 1000 SOL Opens my testnet account It s not odd   it s exactly what alts do with the current market conditions  SOL is a good project and will do well in time  but if BTC dumps  the alts dump harder With the market overall bearish alts tend to bleed into bitcoin as a safer store of value  If it chops sideways for a while then alts might be able to make a move  but alt season is probably over for a while what are other options to buy solana now that coinbase is temporarily not selling it Same here Everyone should listen to this man  This is very  very good advice It d be tight to have one tho My guess like many here  is that SOL s price was abnormally high post crash compared to all other cryptos because of the Coinbase listing   What do you think would be it s price without it  The delay removes that out of the equation Think also about those with the means to make it tank to buy it cheaper    30 32 has been holding strong  so you can expect someone out there is trying break that down or draw patterns on the chart trio make you sell It s obvious the day of the listing the price is gonna jump to at least 56 minimum  And this listing is different  it s not an obscure crypto that barely anyone knows that is getting listed   Alot of people that only have access to Coinbase are looking forward to being able to buy Solana I would just sit back and enjoy what s coming  I myself buy a little more every even number down people selling the coinbase pro listing is my guess I got a sketchy dm to a tweet that points to a weird domainthis is the stupidest scam ever   and i would have fell for it if the shirt design was the one i asked for I do not see a English channel in the discord and do not have the ability to send messages in the channel  Is there something I m missing  Really want to develop on Solana 15 56 doesn t matter  This is the best blockchain  They just need to get over themselves and fix the rpc shit  The user experience is horrible because they won t ramp up their efforts  literally they need to do 100x what they are doing  and are losing their user base in droves  Fix the f ing rpc None that I know of  this is more of a theoretical question Hi I do not see an English channel in the discord  Do you know why that might be Btc shedded it s wealth with tons of alts during this crash the cover story is chinas banks will not allow crypto to be used the other cover is China may have had a power outage  Cryptos will go up in two months things will look bear for 2 months Kin spl None are stable only Don t mention it  Love seeing enthusiasm for this project as I m jacked for it too It ranges from a money losing venture to a very  very profitable one    all depending on the amount of stake you can acquire If you have community engagement  can add extra features that draw people to your validator  an ability to build a very capable system that performs very well as a validator  business sense  luck  and connections   or some combination of all of the above   you can succeed as a validator   But it s like a business  some people succeed  some people fail   Often its not down to the quality of the individual effort  but the whims of fate  to a degree  If you want to actually play with the numbers to see what is achievable https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1HPU_uG3iJ_ns27CItdWGllW0c Pn07J0_LEDZs1otQY edit gid 0 Thanks so much my friend The idea is to make a Excel sheet and share with the community What solana  project has that pool Sometimes the simplest of the solutions work Thanks Yes  I was having issues harvesting my rewards due to not having enough SOL  So i reached out to the Raydium discord support channel and the scammer was posing as a MOD  Support help  He actually helped me with my rewards issue  I topped up enough SOL to harvest my rewards  and then two days later my account was hacked  When I went back to the discord Support  I didn t see his name so reached out to another support Mod and showed him the screen shots  and he said he wasn t and active mod or support  So  at the very least I helped them find him so they could  ban him From past experience when projects get added to coinbase it doesn t exactly affect the price positively  It does give the projects more legitimacy and volume but usually they use the news to the insiders advantage On Serum you can place a limit order buy or sell and see the other open orders  So you can have an order placed that says if sushi drops to a certain price you buy it  you don t have to just except market rate and slippage l  It s also cheaper to place limit orders than swaps even within serum  raydium swap is most common   not to mention gas fees some thoughts here https   www reddit com r solana comments ne6uyh for_those_asking_why_solana_this_is_why gyh6rx5  utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf amp context 3 and girls and everyone who believes in SOL SOL taking a 19  loss   Glad I wasnt able to invest today What does all of these mean  Should I understand like this or do you have simpler explanation SPL There s a huge surge initially though  Lots of people buy off coinbase so once it s released they can sell day 1 on coinbase and get the quick profits  There was even a post here showing the 40  average bump after a coinbase release  which is the highest of any of the exchanges No  it is not  Just having to use 128 GB  with the possibility of expanding it to 256 GB as per the recommended specs  means you need to spend way more on the motherboard and the processor as well You can t just grab a gaming PC and put 128 GB in it  The vast  vast majority of validators just rent the hardware for reason Load up  Do it  Bull market is not over  Fucking do it  FUCKING DO IT I ve  Noticed with some tokens no matter if u have the funds in usdc Orr usdt tokens like MER won t go thru depending where u live I m assuming  I m in cali you are  it just lost half its volume and you can still say  load up glad I got out of this coin on top Yeah it causes turbulence  but the impact seems to amplify with solana  The China news is just a reiteration of 2017 statement  Anyway  I decided to stake all my sol and forget about this crazy volatility Wearing a tshirt about money investment feels very cheap to me  Misguided emotional attachment Trust goes against a core purpose of cryptocurrency  Remember what happened when Bitcoin owners trusted Mt  Gox  850 000 Bitcoin went  missing  in 2015  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Mt _Gox The guy with the gold makes the rules In the US trying to buy SOL  FTX us  Trying to buy other spl tokens like srm  Ray  Cope  et all  Use ftx us as on off ramp and trade on the serum dex  Deposit usd or stable coin to ftx us  if depositing fiat it takes several days to clear   My favorite ui for the Serum dex is raydium io  Get a wallet like sollet io that connects to the dex  Send usdc from ftx us to your wallet and trade away  Don t keep those coins in your sollet there are several good mobile wallets Yes Hell Yes It was that new out of China Once that news out of China hit it was time to liquidate all long futures positions   short futures positions would have made you a ton of money Quit buying laptops and get a desktop Bro 128gb gm of ram is only like  500 Yea I noticed that too  also some liquidity pool tokens show up as a wierd entry   A lot of the     stopped showing  ie  the total amount investing after I started to pool and stake Yes  I want a T shirt No  Go away Scam  Report this I thinks it s the new out of China that has everybody running for the exits though Yeah  I hear a lot of screaming Sunday morning from those long in crypto  including SOL Do you think they are the fastest right now at 50 000 transactions per second   ETH 2 0 is supposed to be 100 000 TPS   what else out there is that fast  Polkadex  PDEX  says it can handle 500 000 trades per second but is that the same as TPS and Polkadex is not on the list of  polkaproject Care to recommend an alternative DogeCoin and solana are both coming  coinbase is doing it s thing and manipulating the crap out of markets Yep it s not looking good  was not thinking it would be this bad  but this is not the first time news out of China made crypto drop like this yes Yeah true  they were having a conference when the fall started   but now they are dropping with the rest of the market Most of the large cap cryptos dropped  snd Solana still ranks  17 as of Sunday morning  May  23  I m tempted to buy my first crypto position Man WSB really did a number  there can be no serious discussion without  paper hands   to the moon  and other hollow sayings  I just gave my honest opinion  do with it as you like Wow  I m talking a hit I didn t sell  lost half  it don t make sense to sell now  no telling how long I will have to wait for it to come back SMH No they aren t  The nice thing about mining pools is you can leave and switch pools in a few minutes  This happened recently  Binance pool was not signalling for the Taproot and there was a push from miners to leave the pool for other pools that were signalling  Their hashrate went from around 12 percent to 4 percent Yes Decentralized piece of shit Cause no one is really special in cryptocurrency   when btc is down everyone follows    everything are just hype     the real investors have already taken profits    and the retailers are following then  after this another long years of bear market and consolidation many big investors will quitely accumulate at this stage before they hype this again Lol the whole market is down because of bitcoin FUD  I must have heard the China fud 10 times now   Alts act like leveraged bitcoin  rise faster and tank harder I did buy a dip then it dipped again  Now I m waiting until I see an uptrend before I buy again because this shit ain t done dipping solana Coinbase Pro listing on may 24th Ok  Raydium increased circulating supply 10 days ago by millions  First there was 36 mil and suddenly 48 mil  Team said it came from harvesting  This whole ecosystem has some odd smell  I cannot proof anything but this looks and feels weird  I d like to have explanation to all of this With a rise like SOL has had there is no support anywhere to be found   I been buying the whole way down  Feels wild though Perhaps that s my issue  I m not doing whole numbers I m weary but yeah it seems like business as usual this like the 15th time China has banned crypto I use Gate io If we watch bitcoin and solana like they move on the same way and path  what s the difference  Actually all alts are following the same path at the moment  If you are investing in solana why you have to watch btc dropping  They are completely different things following the same drop  Just don t get it btc must not be a thing to compare solana AMM s are running layer 1 on eth  That would be news to me What I ve noticed about the past few big CB announcements is that the asset runs up until the actual release moment  amp  then it crashes as the previous holders dump on all the new CB buyers   I feel the SOL news has got completely overshadowed by this massive market flush   Cheers Source Ahhhh  this just doesn t hold up whatsoever as an analogy dude  I understand the whole be realistic thing but  cmon haha as if sol is some anomaly   Soooooo many coins explode and break out of their initial price zones   SolIs a 50  coin noDoubt and it s gonna shoot back up Bc all the fomo heads that will be copping who wished they did prior What s crazy is that Solana moved before that looks like a likely bigger BTC drop later today  I like  SOL  but I m going to try to make one move today  and if it hits it hits  If not  then I m okay with that FTX Be careful to net sell me these for 56 bucks  we are going back to the earth Drop is not finished with 5 to 30 times profits from last year There are a lot of good resources on the Solana Twitch too I do not underestimate the power of the project  but with the current situation everything is reopening  people will go on vacation buy some cars  you can t use crypto for buying  This will change in the next decade  Furthermore the recent news for banning crypto from China is a bullshit  because they ban crypto for 1800 times  And it can t be stopped now  You can trade freely if you have access to internet  If you have assets in crypto there is no way US government to chase you for taxes  Now with this 50  drop I can clearly see that 50  of people don t have a fucking idea why they are in crypto Yeah makes sense People want to enjoy their summer and will cash out some So called  good news  often turns out to be   bad news  for investors People cashed out on the  good news No 1 knows why Definitely correlation  but the downmove was accelerated due to SOL specific attributes  SOL will rally if BTC rallies from here  no doubt   but I think your upside potential is a lot higher here for SOL  On the downside a lot of it has been cleaned out in SOL  The people who wanted to sell have sold  let s see next epoch   but I don t see much more selling at this point Not sure about the bread analogy   I agree with you that you can t really talk about fair price in those markets  But there is genuine adoption and use of SOL that has started to happen en masse  This is not just some random fringe project from a Qualcomm kid any longer Look at it the same way as you look at Facebook  at first it s just some Harvard kid who creates mySpace for his campus  And then adoption just blew like a powder keg  Now  I don t pretend this is Facebook  but so far as long as ETH doesn t get their act together they are the leader in the crypto space IMO  DOT and Cardano are good but not as good as this project Let s see  People are really underestimating the interest from institutional investors and family offices  Investment banks are starting to offer it on a digital platter to them  All this cash will go into BTC and ETH and will then filter down into SOL  The whole crypto space is going to blow up this summer I don t think it s right to talk about hyperinflation when talking about crypto  Thousands of those projects will die  the valuations are frothy and rich  but the few will stay and those few will be the equivalent of GOOG and AMZN in 2000 good question  I was doing  max  option normally when swapping   I can get on pc rn and see my transactions  But I believe both even and odd  s someone theoretically could  but the risk in future gas fees should deter themthere s more to ripple than the tech   there s a bunch of bank handholding and specialized accounting and so on   it has its specific use case and strong support system around itthat s not to say they can t fork solana and internalize the gas fee as a billing system for the product   that seems more likelyripple is centralized garbage because don t like an open back door   that s there by design I would love  2  I d buy everything I could   but I don t think we are headed close to there Even at 21   that lucky bastard am I the only person that s happy about this   the fundamentals haven t changed and it s on sale   load up  boys Yea this has been great for me averaging down   I m looong on this project so 3 weeks  Might take 3 years I was trashed on this sub for telling people to sell what they didn t want to lose when the price had an upswing  I didn t time it well myself and was kicking myself for selling my  small  bag for a bad price  38   However  last night one of my buy orders was triggered at 25  I have buy orders set for even lower prices  if it ever drops to that level  I ll average my price down a lot  I don t know if this is helpful  but this has been my strategy with other coins too and I don t feel too bad about prices dropping down Like any good financial expert  you forgot to add  this is not financial advice  Go figure You re not understanding I m saying a single application of Solana could be be better at being XRP than XRP is Demonstrating that would blow people s minds Solana is better in every way Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns Idk it s  just copying fucking btc if that drops more sol will find new bottom Exactly the same  The bounce to 21 and back to 25 was a minute if that  I think we found bottom Guys  I bought SOLANA to make a gift to a girl  now she has fallen  Let s PUMP SOLANA to the moon And were you doing whole numbers of fractional Just a great time to buy in for me It s simply because the design is more efficient  Proof of History allows for a lot of optimizations  the Leader Schedule  its written in Rust  its validators are optimized  That is what makes it fast and that is what makes the fees low But how come their transaction fee is so low  way lower than cardano s   That s a good thing of course  but it makes me think that it s a bit centralized What happens when you get liquidated  Especially on compound  I need an experienced view to this Yes  you are 100  right  Im think so too It s a payment bridge between fiat and crypto The point isn t about XRP  its that the concept helps push mass adoption if done right Imagine you use software analogous to ripple instead of a debit machine to pay at a restaurant before crypto becomes mainstream This would boom the value of that crypto tremendously and help push adoption of crypto Solana has specs that make that considerable I think Ha yes   I forgot that the market was controlled by paper hands retail investors Probably above  50 if I have to be grounded  But I do believe SOL will be above  1 000 longterm At  20 the seed investors still did x1000  impossible to estimate a bottom I m genuinely shocked I thought 33 was the bottom  Then 30  Then 27   my god we hit 21 All in a single day from like 40 It s gonna be a rough time for awhile I guess Ripple is centralized garbage   Why people get so caught up in it bafflles me Because sol held up so well during btcs first drop from the highs  It has a lot farther to fall Pretty clear bear market signs at this point 40  dip in a single day Number 1 on negative 24hr Yes  But my god this price drop Good man  this is a good fix  and if that doesn t do it  judt keepTrying and the trade willHappen  Buggy a lilSometimes  Not lately tho I ve had no issue buying sol w any of the options on the swap Download Phantom  I can give u  A beta code if u need Brush I swapped a full eth for moresol when eth was 3 400 but sol was 49  So I guess it s a wash Bc eth would swap for around the same now   I love me skmeSOL x remindme Wow  lots of fud and paper bois in this thread  Let s not forget that this could ve  happened because I CB listing even without rh current market xonfiditons  so it s a good thing that the correction can semi disguise sol s dip  Anyone with a brain will be loading up like crazy on sol  I think we re going straight  back to 50   75 etc very soon  Maddddd heads will  know about SOLANA soon  And it s game over then Edit   FUD Sure The epoch ended yesterday  so previously inaccessible funds have now been un delegated  and can now be sold to lock in profits  since we are going into a bear market     Re opening of consumer services   vacations  restaurants  bars  in almost all of the 1st world countries  will also cause prices to drop 80  90  over the course of the summer  for all coins  as people just choose to use their funds to enjoy life again  have to pay for gas  etc  etc  This is common sense    Starting September start DCA ing in projects you believe in  SOL  DOT  ETH  maybe ADA  for me  Will take 3 4 years but then you will be in a very good position   Right now  if you have any profits  I would take out your initial investment   50  of your puer profit and enjoy your summer winter  depending on hemisphere Where did you do the solFutures   Blessinfs my guy  the good karma of this world willReturn to yoh Crypto payment will be integrated soon   Source    https   twitter com solana status 1394338750155698176 Probably the coolest Cool story Put your money into usdt staking for a couple of month and than buy in again  Think that will make you a happy men in three years Sorry to hear this  We are all bleeding People buy the hype and sell the news  this predates cryptocurrencies I dont think the listing on coinbase have much impact on the price everybody is scared at this market and its already listed on binance which is 3 times bigger Nobody knows in this manipuladed shit market You cant compare 15 dollar to 4500 15 is still 30x from all time low If you DCA that s not a problem ahahah i m buying the same amount every month  this crash is good for my pocket ahah it is  but people load up to sell that news  good news thats long rumored and very likely often sees a dump   usually short lived  nothing to worry aboutdont stress about buying the top either   your entry will look cheap six months from nowjust dollar cost down when you cani bought at 30 earlier today and its 26 now lol fml In the end proof of work is just proof of stake with  indirections  That is how all blockchain works If the incentives were similar  china would throw a billion at it   Theres no inherent mechanism that says  whoa buddy you have too many validators nearby Oh wow that s terrible  it looks bad  I love the SOL project and ecosystem   I hope coinbase gets it together  it makes it look like it s a problem with Solana when the problem is coinbase  why would people sell like that  it makes no sense I have a feeling this has something to do with Coinbase Pro adding SOL     Trading will begin on or after 9AM Pacific Time  PT  Monday May 24    if liquidity conditions     are met     If I understand this correctly  CB needs certain amount of SOL in order to allow trading  So price is being manipulated down to give them better entry point imo  Just my speculation  https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2  https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 I am sure there are more total nodes in both Bitcoin and Ethereum than in Solana  However they are coordinated in large mining pools and that makes their voting power more centralized than on Solana  where the voting power is more evenly distributed on a smaller network of total nodes Solana may be more vulnerable to technical faults  in 16 nodes  than Ethereum or Bitcoin  but Ethereum and Bitcoin are more vulnerable to a coordinated voting attack Depends how you look at it  if it goes back to 10  I would rather wait  Sometimes its better to not take the risk It got listed on coinbase so I thought that was good news If so it s a buying opportunity Coinbase Market sees to be going down for now  looks like not good  take a look at the bitcoin candles for the last 4 hour  1 day and 3 days  It can change this week  but for now it looks bad  I personally think that we are now on the way to 30 000   28 800  but we will see from there  I m not a guru also  It just looks bad a non mining node in bitcoin or ethereum doesn t add any decentralization  they re read only nodes  they have 0 power  it s like saying a book is more decentralized because it has more readers  but still only 1 author both BTC and ETH only have a few mining pools  ie only have a few people deciding what gets written to the chain  there s a lot of different people providing hashpower  but those people aren t running nodes  they re basically just delegating their vote to a few mining pools  basically both ETH and BTC only have a few  validating nodes   miners don t run nodes  and non miners who run nodes don t validate and do nothing CB I noticed that too  maybe CoinBase brings in more paper handed newbs than we realize Just bought 170 more at 26 4  If it goes below 20 I ll buy again for around 4000Euro  Sure It may go down to 15 or Below and stay there for months  However  2weeks ago no one thought it could be ever bought sub 30 again  The whole market is f     up   the news about CB  That s it Why do you believe that I use the exodus wallet  Its pretty sweet  One button and you are staking  I also have algo and ada staking in edodus Its going to drop more  I m sorry  but I think for the next six months its not looking good  Be prepared  its not financial advice Its the final shakedown do  do  da ditt ditt doo Nothing tragichttps   twitter com CoinbasePro status 1395939105947725834 Lol 100  for sure  Take off time Best is to find a place that gives you 10  APY on your stablecoins May I kindly ask I ask how I might stake mine brotha  I am familiar with the concept itself  but curious how a fello Solana enthusiast would strategize choose a provider  Please and thanks Sorry to hear that Thank you for the heads up Im afraid but I hodl my 56 pieces  D binance what is the rpc problem Dude  how could you not  everytime a coin has been released on coinbase it has fallen  that multiplied by the entire market getting cut in half  how are you still suprised do you think Sol will outperform most other coins Totally not the best period to play with futures  I  ve placed a buy order at 28  6 7 days ago and I just got in  Just HODL for now Why doesn t Solana Store accept SOL This is just one way of measuring decentralization  By many of the other ways of measuring  such as concentration of validation nodes  solana is far more centralized   Hopefully once its Mainnet leaves beta it won t be  but at present it is Yeah    I bought another big bag after the CB announcement and now wish I had waited I literally don t buy btc dropped almost 50  from it s coinbase announcement 2 days ago  I honestly can t believe what I m seeing Why am i not suprised the coinbase listing is delayed  Seems like a perfect fus narrative play Even if trading sideways appreciate the 10  apy on the stake Why is anyone playing futures this week Enjoy the next six month  it will probably bleed a lot more You shouldn t care about 3 months or 1 year  No one can tell you the price  but it s very probable that you will be a happy man 2025 if you HODL now
2021-05-24,24.49832001,32.09444973,24.49832001,I think you mean  1 000 It would be cool if FTX and or solana just made a more official piece of software to house integrate these types of projects    something like Anaconda  Just feels a bit sketch having the feeling of your money being spread across these semi linked sites projects No problem Thanks for the insightful response It would be better to host AMA sessions once every week for price and speculation related talks   Also  adding a rule that speculation posts are discouraged except on AMA I think its possible  but much less likely  Exodus has already filed with the SEC and is deep in the legal system  But yes  they require some level of trust Looks like it is delayed  https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 Oh wow I forgot about this  the past few days have been rough lmao That Matty cameo lmfao Thats just  poor software design  in my opinion  Imagine if 500 people all create their own name service  how does it puts explorers in to place  The explorers and other services will have to use all 500 name services Only BTC miners can validate and they use expensive ASICS made by a few companies making BTC centralized to an extent  You are restricted to specialist equipment from a small group of people SOL on the other hand can be run by anyone with a high end pc CPU  12 cores   24 threads  or more  2 8GHz  or faster       RAM  128GB  or more  Motherboard with 256GB capacity suggested   Disk  PCIe Gen3 x4 NVME SSD  or better  Accounts  500GB  or larger       GPUs  Not strictly necessary at this time  Motherboard and power supply speced to add one or more high end GPUs in the future suggested  https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs  https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs  amp  x200B This makes Solana more decentralised than BTC due to the lower barrier of entry to validate tx Does solana list Coinbase today Yea it s a good buy  coin is solid overall  Hopefully the devs improve it s weaknesses going forward and don t just sit on their hands  It could be huuuge From what I can interpret  your logic is Raydium would be foolish to rug pull  millions  when there is potential to earn much more from continued operations  That sounds awfully risky  don t you think Forgive me  but I have a sizeable RAY investment and need to evaluate the risk Yep lions fan all the way from New Zealand I went outside but took my phone with me  Ffffffffffffffff Thank you Buy Solana and the Dex Raydium for Solana ecosystem  You can thank me in 2 years when you will become a millionaire Were couldI find dapps and solana alts being traded Like It s Early We are still relying on manual slashing making us technically centralized Being early we do not know how well everything is going to work when things get going  It looks good but with innovative technologies surprises can happen While being extremely scalable horizontally  the cost is high demands for minimum hardware  The system is designed with moore s law in mind that computer hardware is getting continually better fast  If computer hardware keeps getting better  then Solana will lead  Ethereum is designed to be able to run on a bad laptop  Solana needs a good gaming rig or a specialized machine to run  That is not saying that Ethereum could match Solana by increasing tech demands  Solana has basically maximized hardware demand FTX us  https   FTX us    It was very easy to setup and I was able to buy in about 5 mins   Their account validation process using google authenticator  face recognition and whole process is much faster than  Binance us  https   Binance us    It also run by the biggest SOL backer If you have a link to that info please send it to me thanks surely you ve heard of uniswap I read without KYC you can withdraw but max lifetime limit is      1k So if that s all you want it will work NY residents can t use Exodus Is Binance full for staking Yes  I ll link you right now  And light speed is correct   the speed of light via hash functions transmitted through fiber optics across the globe  LemmeGet the link fromAn article for u Don t know how to tag a mod but if they didn t do it by now obviously its not important and wasn t requested by others  I just find other crypto subs way more informative and helpful but every crypto community is a little different   It s not just Reddit  Youtubers show ways to get coins other than on exchanges all the time but the alternative way to get Sol not a single video  I ll just hope it s not too much more than now when it hits Coinbase but by then I feel I ll just invest money elsewhere  Sucks cause I wanted to long hold Sol but getting it has been so difficult I just feel defeated  lol Yea  my purchase price was 47 now it s less than half  I m thinking to cut losses I dont see where is say solana will be listed on coinbase pro Because they have rj forew sight that grow in with Solana ad making money forever is better than a qucick scam Yes and serum Bro big facts  We get a second chance Only my opinion   but I believe they need a big shout out from an Elon  or Cuban type  that s it I d like to see Cathie Wood from Ark take a real look  Solanan s a winner   just need a little marketing boost      however   when the institutional giants get involved   they usually ruin for the little guy We re seeing that right now with the crash That s my big question  when is there a clear uptrend Now I m just buying small pieces Agreed  Ok then  where can I find an informative outlook on Solana s future vs Ethereum and other Layer 1 contenders Everything drops after goes on coinbase then hold on I tried all the fixes listed here too   and then it turned out to be a next step I needed to take on the Nano itself  Make you ve selected the SOL app on the Nano  and double clicked so it shows  Application Ready  on the screen  That did it for me If been eyeballing this project now for a week or two This is definitely a game changer  In 2017 you had Iconomi  which had a similar goal  I have no clue why they aren t around anymore For a few months lol  I m holding   no matter What s stopping this anonymous team You are free to create your own service that people can use to look up token names  not beholden to anyone on github   That s decentralization No  the reason for low transaction fees is because validators don t need them to survive or be profitable   Inflation is high enough right now that transaction fees are basically an afterthought for validators   If transaction fees were actually needed to sustain validators at the moment  then there would be no choice but to raise them  or see validators fail and the number of validators shrink  which would not be acceptable As inflation decreases over time  we will eventually reach a point where validators will actually need those transaction fees in order to be profitable   The idea is that by that time  use of the network will have grown to an extent where the much larger number of transactions provides sufficient rewards to offset the reduced inflation That s neither good nor bad isn t it   You can leave and switch pools to prevent a 51  attack  but by the same token you have the greater ability to quickly coordinate a 51  attack Xeons commonly run close to 5 0ghz on water cooling and have unlocked multiplier Raydium I think is a good buy with lots of upswing potential 1  I don t think anyone can credibly claim that POH is better than POS consensus  mostly because we ve never seen either of them get scaled and loaded before  I m think all we can really say right now is that they re different enough that a POH chain shouldn t be in the same bucket as most POS chains  which gives it its own value 2  While POS chains like ETH2 and Cardano can use pretty simple machines for validators  Solana s POH requires some pretty high spec machines to keep up with the network  which makes decentralization tougher  They re also currently working through significant throughout challenges from needs for a lot of RPC server nodes TLDR  It s too early to know which confirmation mechanism is best yet  or if either of them will even work at scale How do you do this   I want in I m really keen for indexs  I have two concerns I wonder if they can actually add coins from other blockhains  And not wrapped versions if them And if they will do something with the original index on solana of seco and holy Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum

much only use the mobile app How are liquidity conditions met before trading starts  Sorry but they said after 9am PT today  Figured to measure liquidity they have to actually open an order book  Maybe youre the ignorant one Well he says  developers absolutely love Rust  which is not true  some love it but some hate it   I personally kinda hate it  I d rather sacrifice some performance for readability   When talking about smart contracts though it probably doesn t matter much  but Solana wrote everything in Rust and all the examples in the docs use Rust   And that s going to hurt adoption because Rust is really  really hard I stake on moonlet and it tells me that I m getting an APY of 11 62 Wow  I love how people just hop on Reddit uninformed and ignorant as you could possibly be  Asking questions they literally must have scrolled over the answers  to ask about news from last Friday  Damn You can  Refresh Blockchain   It will update the total balance  On a desktop computer Solana wallet page  click the 3 dots at top right   Refresh Blockchain  is the 4th from the top  It only takes a few seconds I know we aren t supposed to talk price s  but same I now have 62 sol and bought most in mid to low 20 s  It doesn t come anywhere close to what I ve lost in the last couple of weeks  I think if everyone get s what they can  and can hold on till 2024   25  they ll be very  happy they did  Sol is going to be bigger than BTC  Faster  more efficient  and just more sensible in my eyes  But who knows really I guess  anything could happen  Alright I m done dead cat bounce holy shit on a camelback I can t say much for other wallets but exodus does a pretty good job  current rate they have is 10 28   My only gripe is how the balance is displayed as it seems they re displaying your balance as it just adds to your staked balance  If you wanna know more check out the r exoduswallet subreddit Really feel like this is the stage where people will say  why the fuck didn t I sell here   The dip was a warning  Has bull trap written all over it I bought my first 10 solana  Feeling good about it at 20 U phrased this as if your personal sentiment is a rebuttal to OPs point  which it isn t Rust has been voted the most loved programming language on stackoverflow how many years in a row now Damn wish it was available this morning when I filled my bags If you really did  im happy for you I get the feeling they postponed it to make sure the market was ripe for a listing Very optimistically   1000 in 3 5  More than that s asking  just a bit too much unless it becomes the defacto solution over eth for a lot of things it may not exist in 5 years  but if it does  taking into account at least 10 times market cap of crypto market  maybe 1k     F  ck  it will be 100k    go crazy   D It was 7 41  a few days ago  not 10 40 Didn t know that thanks for letting me know I m just looking for ease of use and safety of funds so far  I m honestly pretty pleased so far  Even if the rates aren t accurate I m still satisfied so far Why are you going like this SOLLL    Lets move Moonlet s APY is 8 34  over the past 38 days   That s a decent result  and they do offer the extra convenience of their staking front end  so I think it s a good suggestion   I would recommend staking some to moonlet to support their staking front end  and some with other small validators with good returns https   stakeview appIt has  accurate  list of APY for  every validator  if you look at the historic data  last epoch  avg prev 3  avg last 10    It has a reasonable estimation of current performance for the current epoch too solanabeach io is nice but very buggy   Be prepared for and expect lots of bugs  and don t get freaked out by anything you see there  just confirm any data you find strange at a more reliable site   For example  the Solana block explorer Excellent answer   For an analogy think of bank accounts for fiat where as long as you maintain a minimum balance  there is no service charge   If you dip below that balance  you pay a monthly service charge The difference is that for banks  the minimum is usually hundreds or thousands of dollars   For Solana  the minimum is a fraction of a penny   It s so little that most people would never even have an account with such a low value and don t even realize that the minimum exists I bought 20 coins at 27  How much do you expect it to be in 5 years Because it s kind of meaningless   The price may crash again  leaving all the congratulations for nothing   I guess I prefer pessimism so as not to get my hopes up too much Is that true in Exodus too It s honest work That s a pretty good article on Solana  I look forward to his deep dive follow up article tf  we have to rent wallets on sol  Is there other wallet providers Sorry to hear  Good luck in the recovery process  Eating a shit sandwich is part of life and hopefully we can learn from our mistakes and losses It s a trap I like anything built on Solana  it s awesome Not all the networks and protocols are the same so every chain needs its own settings to make it interact well with other parts of the system  And also I think they need to set their own liquidity to be able to cover demand when launching it You are very welcome  SOL   APY in Exodus changes  It was 10 59  when I started  10 40  few days ago  10 28  now On  Solana Beach  https   solanabeach io   you can see active stake 337 4M It doesn t matter  APY chnges regularly  therefore watch out  Whenever you decide to stalk  you lose min 1 day to start and 1 day to get the crypto back It is nice to not be staring at five figure losses anymore Although different stalking period  Sol is for 30 days  Ada is only 15  For 30 days Ada is arround 5 On Binance Sol is 10 10   apy and Ada is 17 Thank you for the feedback I heard the more people stake  the less   APY  ADA has been around since 2017  Solana is quite new  from 2020   we are all early birds Bought about the same at the top when airdrop some   haha i like Solana more that Polkadot or Cardano dont know why are not already on top 5 Well  that s also not true  An announcement will be made  We re done here  edit  your comments all you want How the hell they can meet liquidity if they suspended deposits lmao Lmao I remember that comment  DAnd same Did you delete your comment because you know you re wrong or because you care about your karma points I put in a ticket with customer support  maybe they need a few more reminders Anyone from NYC have success with FTX us I am not 100  sure  but it is my understanding that the more people stake  the lower the APY will get You re obnoxiously stupid Long term it s an advantage    but short term   most devs actually writing blockchain code are still familiar with solidity and will continue using networks that favour it  For me   I didn t know either beforehand   but the amount of code samples around smart contracts and the dev tooling for blockchain  is so large for solidity that I just jumped into it instead of rust How is this different than any other coin they ve launched in the past year  I d assume they have this down to a science It was an update of the original post  Fuck  you re dense Social media sites as well  although less critical   I m sure would appreciate getting the  like  across faster Nice but do know what causes the APY to be that high   Compared to those like ADA   4 5 Ads also compete on so called exchanges as well in the advertising space so the idea of high throughput defi extends to other applications that run billions of dollars daily maybe a little spike but i doubt we ll snap back to 50 right away Sam Bankman Fried considers it the best blockchain  right now  to use for his Serum dex and de fi  with the potential to be much better in the future  At least we have him Nothing will change is not an answer   lol No thank you Where did you see that  Is there a new announcement Not sure what kind of answer you re looking for  https   raydium io info They literally can t rug pull I use moonlet  they let you choose which validator to delegate to  and they show their commission rates you should know Alameda Research invested to Solstarter  not solanium I can sell you more for 60 Probably when BTC stabalizes When in doubt  zoom outIs SOL down 40  from last week   Yes   But the whole marketcap is down 1T Is SOL up a mind bending 4685 2  this year   Yes Chill and stake well Well that s a concern  It s more centralised than ethereum but less than say BSC  For this reason i m still mostly on eth and btc  Solana is a niche  It shouldn t be your main play Remember the question I was answering was specifically about recreating Ripple  a massive cross country cross bank settlement solution  not about general dapps   I m speaking about a system that needs to move a billion marbles and then makes many microsettlements to adjust for fx differences I don t know too much about BNB but on a cursory search it seems to have the criticisms about hand selecting validators  and absorbing some of those fees to be competitive   BNB is decentralized lite That s kind of my bad  You are right  they are considered an AMM  Uniswap is an automated liquidity protocol  but it doesn t have a  CLOB   central limit order book   which means it s just using math to do the price spectrum  I should probably be more specific in the future  but that s really what I am getting at  that Solana is able to power modern market tools directly on chain at layer 1  For Uniswap and the hundreds of other DEXes out there  they won t be able to use Ethereum directly to make a comparable system  Maybe on Eth2 they might  but it would all have to run on a single shard  and that s a risk factor for me  There are a ton of brilliant people working in this space  so I m sure someone will figure something out If you have the crystal ball  you can always long and short SOL I don t have a crystal ball but I have a long term vision only SOL is available on Monday 24     9 am PT This definitely isn t financial advice but for myself I m waiting for the next huge dip in crypto  which is unavoidable by the looks of it    yeah I m new  I could very well see this hitting  19  21 again I bought on friday at 39  too   What a big dip   In your opinion should I buy more at 20 and half ADC If you believe and have spare funds then YES I bought 2000  all in  at 41 42 so yeah you are good Don t worry next week will be more dips This is crazy hilarious  thank you for this  you just made my day Yeah FTX is the natural place to buy SOL and the various tokens that are part of its ecosystem Whhaaat When will be available for trading Dont do this  please Yes  Buy SOL every day VB s arguments are flawed  So what if it takes less hardware to run a node  Your vote is still weighted according to your stake  What will essentially happen with eth2 0 is the professional stakers who receive stake from users like me and u will have a monopoly  But i dont think this is so bad as long as there are more than say 10 validators holding half the stake  Because then in order for them to collude would take 10 entities agreeing on the same thing They need me to clean that room up and order food and coffee I have been asking the community this question too  Specifically  what s preventing Raydium  run by an anonymous group  from doing a rug pull  So far nobody can give me a comforting answer Thanks and will check Its still there  Constant 10 The short answer is correct  you need 32 ETH  but you can run it on crap hardware for  600 yearThe other answer is depends  It s possible to run a full node on AWS for under  30 mo what I think is called a beacon Why is that a bad thing   Newbie asking to learn not to question your statement I don t agree but okay  At 5 59pm WAT it was at a low of  19  If I had known it would reach that low I would have bought at that price  I bought around the resistance of  22 Nah you do fine  I just am a bit pedantic Doesn t it cost a ton of ETH to run a ETH node  I know the specs aren t as high as Solana though  Anyways  Solana is a much better project IMO The mechanism you describe will always have to exist   Some kinds of slashing are always going to be a governance decision   Except for the one or two automatically slashable cases  which can be done by code  and that has not been implemented yet The official twitter page Exactly Bravo  Pretty classy shit content Whats the apy  And is this still ongoing   I have ftx but did not find it  will have to dig further FTX pretty good Still very early ecosystem  For example  Raydium  arguably the most popular Solana app  is run by an anonymous group and remains closed source  Nothing preventing them from doing a rug pull as far as I know  God forbid this were to happen  it would take Solana some time to recover from such a scandal I needed this There is a 21 hour delay fetching comments   Defaulted to

they say multiple times saying there aren t enough validators yet to scale the network   We re not there yet   Not everything that is inconvenient to hear is FUD I am waiting for my deposit 2 weeks  I am sure this never gonna happand  There is thousands of people like me  Now sure what have to be done for close this SCAM exchange First of all  Coinbase listing got delayed  not cancelled  Just look at the whole market situation  Why would someone invest when they know prices may fall  It is a good decision to delay and open the listing when market is steady  Feel lucky you are on board SOL  Many of alts have gone so low like people have no trust on their projects  Look on the bright side  we only hit 19   We all were speculating to go even lower to 10   which might be possible if things go down like this I think you do not understand Solana s specs and architecture The reason ETH has those fees is that the network capacity is too low  When you have high network capacity it costs less to perform operations  Please DYOR before spreading FUD The slashing punishment is not automated  that means the system needs to come to a halt and manually perform slashing That makes it a centralized mechanic The infrastructure apart from slashing is decentralized it s just technically we are still centralized when they have the power to pull the plug on a black swan  We still have training wheels on technically Only thing that sucks about exodus is it auto claims rewards Thanks No weakness   none  BUY Exodus wallet  That s what I do No one concerned about how centralized it is  Ok I guess blockchain trillemma is thrown out the window Yes this is possible but lots of us don t want headache of one day logging in and VPN is off and then we have 48 hours to remove all our crypto from out account Really wish this info was in the welcome to Sol page because I live in NY and have been trying to buy it  This sounds easy  Appreciate it Premium content LMAOOOOOOO at that video Yeah  true  I have trouble explaining these things concisely Don t they say invest what you can lose   Perfect spot to implement   Also  I don t see a real argument that could solidify or deter our faith   there fore have faith I bought the dip  4times   not as low as 19 though Like you  I am impressed by the Solana and its community  But relying on blind faith to make any serious investment is totally reckless  Fingers crossed Matthew Graham   mattysino Who s the guy dancing after Raj Gokal Buy another ledger https   buhlaque medium com solana the goddess of light speed transactions 7740cc829c68 Just to clarify  Solana uses PoS consensus   PoH is a clever trick to allow an optimized method for enforcing the leader schedule   PoH allows validators to easily identify blocks emitted by a validator who is not the current leader  which allows such blocks to be trivially rejected in favor of blocks produced by the true leader   Such a thing could also be done by complex message passing multi round consensus algorithms  but that would be way too slow for the TPS that Solana achieves   PoH allows Solana to achieve its low latency and high TPS by making consensus happen faster   But consensus still is ultimately reached by stake weight voting  which is a PoS methodology at heart Just trying to clarify because sometimes people do talk about PoH as if it s the fundamental consensus mechanism  which is a misattribution of its role in the Solana blockchain The slashing has nothing to do with centralization though   Slashing prevents validators from cheating the consensus algorithm to get themselves more vote credits   If they break the voting rules  they make consensus harder  but they don t somehow gain a censorship advantage I appreciate what you re saying  but I think that s a bit of a simplification   You could also say that  anyone with a PC could be a bitcoin miner   if you ignore the fact that they want to make a profit   Anyone can waste time and money running an expensive PC as a bitcoin miner and say that they re mining  even if they never win a block reward  ever Same with Solana   Anyone can make the high end PC and put it in a data center  but you have to have stake to become profitable   And you have to have  a lot  of stake   Every time I tell people how much stake you need  they are amazed and horrified   It s in the 76 000 SOL range   about  2 MILLION DOLLARS  worth However  everyone also needs to realize that  the stake is out there    There are 333 million or so SOL staked right now   So you only need about 0 023  of the SOL that is staked across all validators  to be staked to your node  to break even   Double that to 0 05  and you are making around  15 000 per year  which is much more than most hobbyist ethereum miners make   If you can be really good at being a validator  add features  work hard  market yourself  and gather more stake    with just 0 1  of the staked SOL  you can make about  42 grand per year    And that s at  25 SOL   If SOL doubles up to  50 again  you re making  84 000 per year   All with just 0 1  of the staked SOL There are about 600 actual validators right now  there are more delinquent ones that are dead and still show up on lists  but around 600 that are actually in operation    That means that if they all had the same stake  they d each have 550 000 SOL staked to them and would make around  80 000 per year each at  25 SOL   160 grand per year at  50 SOL  So ask yourself   do you think you can achieve  average  stake In some ways the deck is stacked against you though   there is a lot of institutional stake locked up via backroom deals with large validators already   So you re never going to get that But there is also something working in your favor   a full 400  of the validators are staked by the foundation and they get 225 000  so they re smaller than average   Many of them refuse to be competitive with commission  sticking with the 10  that the foundation allows them   That means that you can easily outcompete at least them  if you do a good job  and if you are willing to take lesser commission while building up your validator Sorry I went off on a bit of a tangent there   Getting back to the point at hand  Solana is easier to get into as a validator than bitcoin is as a miner  but not easier than it was to be a bitcoin miner back when bitcoin was less than two years old like Solana is     and it s certainly not  easy   it takes a real business plan and capital investment to make Solana validation profitable GOLDmy phone autocorrected to GOLF   i should have just left it and not explained why thats true today  but nobody expected ETH gas to spike to  250 for moving 1k either   That wasnt by design and it happened  tokenomics can get weird  thats what i meant by future   of course another design workaround is a solana L2 to make a ripple equivalent but thats harder and im out of my realm herenot trying to be negative here  and i agree that SOL seems positioned to not have such gas fee problems   but if a billion people hop on tomorrow im not sure those fees look as flat Sorry  let me rephrase   I believe they willNot rugpool becuse Solana is more than any blockchain could ever imagine  The human beings  Behind the technology I believe are excited to work each day and write code and improve the world They aren t some hooligans trying to make some pocket money Also everything I  The solana chain is written in rust  it s Insanely complex and secure  and they vetted their teams I mSure if it  Anonymous    To us yes  I bet you the owners of SOL have spoken tk the raydiumFolk  also  Bc I have the tendency to see the good in people and not assume everyone is out for evil Did you not read your link  They updated it and said it was delayed Dude  it s delayed because of technical issues Still waiting I was thinking the same thing I stake my Sol and get a small cut of that 10 5   every 3 days  Upside it  more Sol  Downside  not being able to sell when it dips  To me  I am very happy with solana and its project  So staking is the best for me I thought that was the original launch time  and that the note above is saying it s suspended until further notice Block explorer How crypto moves it s already like it s leveraged  You want to be careful playing with leverage in alts because yea you might have some solid technicals  but when BTC moves the whole market moves And moves like Feb 21  Apr 17  May 18 will completely washout your account  If you want to play leverage  wait for 30 40  drops and go max 1 5x  factor in a 30 50  drop in your liquidation price But honestly after playing leverage and profiting on when BTC futures go into backwardation  I would recommend just staying in spot and staking your SOL with FTX and get a 10  return  With staking your risk of washing out your account is completely eliminated Yes  I ve learned that by reading the Whitepaper  It s an important but overlooked fact Still  I m wondering why more people aren t racing to Solana  The answers in this thread are helpful though Impressive timing Wow  this might be the first time on national tv tbh Bought 3000 coins at 22 Bought all the way from 30s to 26 Didn t think it d drop below that lol Raised my bag from 8 to 20 coins  That s a lot to me and probably will guarantee my future goal in 3 5 years  Feels great How s you find this

even posts like this   There were congratulations for the  diamond hands  that held from 50   gt  40   gt  55 as well Bought 30 coins at 23 I feel great So when people say SOL can process tens of thousands of trades per second that s purely hypothetical right  I thought the network only does about 800 txns per second right now And commiserations to whoever is still holding  bought in the last few hours   ️ Bonfida and the automated bots look dope That s honestly massive to even be on their radar  Van eck has over  60B AUM They announced a few days ago that they re delaying the launch The delay sounds like good news to me  Such an important listing during a period where everything crashes and the fear and greed index is extremely low  would be a bad timing for a potential pump in the price not reading this right  you are      Haos686      Commands   opt out    delete You are not reading this right Not yet  tried on Chrome browser and Opera browser which both of them did not had

And faster than ETH with no sharding I ll believe it if the up trend continues for more than a week Why not put some into the 3 As the value of your coins grow  take profits I guess it s your last point that gives me pause  I already have a stake  but determining position sizing requires asking these types of questions Any minute supposedly how do you stake your SOL on Binance   Are their time restrictions Yes  totally challenging to get right  especially when the rules aren t ironclad and easy to digest   That said  the onus is on the investor to claim their taxes correctly and accordingly   I m sure if you re worth their attention  they d ensure you got it right  lol All I m saying is if you re aiming to  get it right  straight away  it s much easier to do if you can control WHEN you claim your rewards vs auto claiming Some developers like Rust  I find it impenetrable   When you re working in teams readability is super important and for that Go is king  IMO   Rust is near the bottom   It s fast as hell and lightweight but it s a mess  I hate looking at it    I m really intrigued by Solana but I am not looking forward to dealing with Rust  at all Haha gotta admit I like it for this reason technical issues Updated Friday May 21 at 11 08pm ET  We are experiencing technical issues that will temporarily delay the launch of SOL on Coinbase Pro  At this time we are disabling deposits of SOL  withdrawals are still available  We will provide an updated timeline for restoring deposits  amp  enabling trading as soon as possible   https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 That would probably need comprehensible protocols of validator behavior  to allow for fair voting results  This would put any stakeholder in a network moderating position  Hopefully there will be lots of support among validators and community to develop tools to enable this I like the way you think Please go to serum and raydium telegram  The problems are coused from rpc side of serum and raydium  But not sol blockchain Does it make sense to invest in all  ETH ADA  and Sol    or should I choose just one I would hope that is true in future   But I think you are right  that would be the best way to do it I feel like the taxes for things like this are impossible  Surely the IRS doesn t expect everyone to get this right My wallet Address automatically

me Definitely wrong on the second part  It s literally hundreds of times easier and cheaper to run a solana node than a Bitcoin node Hopefully soon Yes  and in my opinion the single biggest problem in crypto is customer service      Sent to the wrong address    Something went wrong with the smart code    Lost password The answer to all of those is   too bad for you   Worded politely If someone stole my Visa card or made a mistake or cancel a transaction    I can always pick up the phone BTC s greatest strengths is it s absolute independence   But for something more complex like Etherium and Solana  we need constant development and implementation   We need those foundations and they need trustworthy and accountable  think about ETH vs ETC  Leadership is also a tricky tropic  as it can be a strength but also a vulnerability I m not claiming that   I m not saying their distribution is perfect either   I m saying they are many holders   You have to remember that Bitcoin was worth literally nothing at the start and yet many people mined it   Those conditions can never be recreated   Any project that looks remotely interesting that comes out now has big players going for the money grab In our current market  I would say fair distribution is an unsolved and open problem  The perfect coin would give  for example 1  a fixed number coin to everyone on earth in a way that cannot be appropriated by others    I don t know how we could go about that   8 billion tokens perfectly distributed You find it under staking  There is 4 5 different cryptos you can stake with FTX  If Im not mistaken  You find Staking in the wallet  next to the coin Or in top right corner  those four white squares  a pop down menu comes out once you tap that  staking is one of the menu points They re locked  only x amount get unlocked after x amount of time  I just don t know what kind of proof you need  Solana has a good reputation  alameda basically spearheaded it via FTX  I don t think Raydium will do anything malicious and I doubt any singular person has direct access to their locked funds  But don t take my word for it  keep looking https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 I wonder why delayed Thanks for this info They did but then later said it s being delayed but the statement was pretty vague besides saying there s a delay The point is their roles is not being a  currecny I agree that it makes sense for BTC to be supply decentralized as you put it since it fills the role of a currency  But I have no problem with Ethereum having more money in its foundation and being more centralized   Indeed ethereum has a face   I actually think it is good idea  Ethereum has been too socialist  If the foundation had more ethereum there would be more incentive by the developers to advance its protocol and get stuff working  sharding has been proposed for three years now with no success   The solana foundation can use the leveraged solana first to motivate the foundation and second to motivate and incentivize developers to develop by awarding them sol tokens  From a company perspective and a pure human perspective it makes complete sense and it is a better business model You are claiming that there isn t a long tail of btc   eth earned by early miners and foundations Thought they said 9am pacific time There is such a thing as supply decentralisation  and is much more important than validator decentralisation  mining  One is economical power  fair distribution  while the other is security BTC is the most decentralised crypto currency in terms of supply  and that is mainly why it is worth so much   ETH is also among the best in this regard   That is also why big firms are now trying to collect and hoard as much as possible     By forcing you to sell for example with a market crash   If crypto is going to define the world s economy  big wallets  not miners  are going to control it Imagine yourself  one day you wake up and create a new currency  You try convince everyone in the world to adopt it   No matter how incredible it is technologically  what government or entity will submit to you if you hold 40  60  80  of the reserves        gt  They will simply create their own   Like they are doing right now I won t name names  but some of the big caps are like that That is the reason why Nakamoto chose to remain anonymous and never spent  and never will spend a single Bitcoin   If Solana is to be widely and institutionally adopted  it has to be decentralised in both axis  Our goal is to gather as much as possible before that happens Maybe this week The order book across chains with the liquidity pools being shared is gonna be one factor that just catapults sol soooo highsWhat a great projectEth I love but   it ain t light speed for pennys Solana is probably the platform best positioned to pose a threat  A lot of people are interested in developing and deploying smart contracts in Solana  I ve not noticed quite the same activity in other chains It s also worth mentioning that Solana already has the best DEXs in the market  And it s actually bigger  and cheaper   than any of the rollup DEXs on Ethereum  The downsides is that making dapps for Solana is very annoying  it s not yet battle tested  it s hard to verify if the program on chain matches the source code  and at the end of the day it s still in beta Thanks  This explains RAY tokenomics and that 20  is allocated to the anonymous founders  Is any of this verifiable What happens if these large interests sell all their shares Hahahabme too Here is a little road to follow to learn more about  sol  decentralization etc if you wish to get more familiar with what you may already own or invest in 1  Research how slashing is implemented on  sol  2  Then research what groups individuals control majority  And how much  what percentage  is any locked up how long If you are worried  nothing wrong if you are  when I got in to crypto decentralized and centralized were very  loaded  words  it s not decentralized yet  Blockchains are constantly upgrading and being voted on  3  I would suggest you also research other top 20 coins that have changed from centralized to decentralized  Get familiar with the process and the reasons for their change  Both centralized and decentralized have uses and values in the world  One hypothetical example  NEO is centralized  that does not mean it does not have a chance to become valuable and a useful tool  even if the  blockchain mindset  is to be against centralization I dont see rust as a disadvantage  Developers absolutley love Rust  And it currently has 10 times more developers compared to solidity Which one exists as the dominant and only used platform  Skype  Google Hangout  Bluejeans or Zoom Achieving monopoly is really hard  takes really special circonstances and is not necessarily a good thing its already delayed on cb pro  and they haven t mentioned anything about Coinbase yet 1 group of people owning the coins has nothing to do with decentralization  U are mixing two completely different things up This has nothing to do with the tech being decentralized it just means that its new and still being sold  Ethereum also has elite bag holders For 1  60  of the coins in circulation are owned by 1 group I m using the charts on Coinbase and Uphold so it might be a little off idk  But when I saw it go below 21 I scooped that shit up not on pro today  delayed Yeah definitely be careful with leverage not only because it s dangerous but because it s extremely addicting I played 100  gt 5 000 in three trades then lost it all in one  That money could have really helped me but I got greedy and kept betting If you get an amazing set up  take the trade and take your winnings off the table  If not  just don t mess with it It s delayed for today   they don t say when it s gonna be on coinbase pro Yes  but remember much of crypto is based on pure emotion and hype  Ethereum isn t going anywhere though okey dok Today on coinbase pro right  Maybe in a couple of days on coinbase  ‍ ️ Yea totally ICOMP or ICMP would have been way better options Tax implications   Self claiming allows you control to do it in spread out intervals and take note of coin price at time of claiming I meant what I wrote  If you think fundamentals means  supply demand   I don t know what to tell you  That is most certainly not what it means Of course  you re right that fundamentals for physical commodities are measured very differently  But otherwise  I have no idea what point you re trying to make  and I m not sure you do  either You are correct It s been delayed  CB came out with a statement last Friday Probably when the market look more stable   bullish Explain why SOL isn t decentralized and ETH is Its definitely not just AWS  It s a smart contract blockchain protocol that extends to having decentralized cloud servers Right on  I think everyone is still learning solana lol  To be honest  I had to brush up on some vocabulary myself  I definitely mixed my opinions with definitions  Yes  serum has both AMM for swapping as well as a CLOB that it let s any solana project tap into  I m not sure about the exact mechanics behind the swaps and their relation to the CLOB  looks like i ve got a new research project Backrest DCA and see how well it would have worked  Very well indeed ICP is more like a decentralized amazon web services  I absolutely cannot stand the name and think it needs rebranding  It reminds me of the rap group Insane Clown Posse everytime I see it  I don t know how this was overlooked as it is like the first thing that comes up when you type icp into google sol has to be decentralized before one could start to compare them Decentralization may happen in time    but currently it is not realistic to compare the twoCan they co exist  Yes  Also remember the vast majority of Altcoins won t survive the next decade  Will  sol survive  Maybe not  time will tell  Invest what you are okay with losing word  i m new to solana so i m trying to understand it better    so far the tech looks extremely promising though the ecosystem is still catching up   i think you re referring to like Serum right   I thought they had order books like an old fashioned  non automated market maker    do they combine that with formulas as well   i think uni and sushi use bonding curves  and my initial impression was that on serum it is more like a traditional exchange  that s cool if they use a hybrid approach There s a few vids I compiled  here are the links  1 Wojack  https   youtu be VmMQ_8N9w74  2 Falling Off  https   youtu be bAMVQck_77k  3 Slav Dancing  https   youtu be VLW1ieY4Izw Thanks checked binance and seems that the offering is sold out  close Yeah just chose ethereum because it s the most widely used right now  But totally agree that only carries so much weight  Adoption of the crypto industry in general is in its infancy  so really anything can happen We don t know But we will know when they do   Price  ️ Binance I have a similiar issue   I have been just sort of  trying out  the DEFI space and doing a little yield farming with the STEP USDC pool   Well  anyways  I harvested some STEP  swapped to USDC  successfull   and wanted to add more liquidity to the pool     It was a low amount like   5 STEP   5 USDC    Anyways  it showed up in  your liquidity pool  but then when I clicked  add  the button didn t work   I refreshed the Raydium page  and it was just gone According to CB it s delayed  Does anyone know how long yeah  last time I checked was 2 00 pm GMT 7 Vietnam time  the slot was full  maybe if  SOL back to  50  the slot will be released     good luck mate D Yes  using desktop app type SOL from the search box and this would display SOL with chart and have to scroll all the way down and you can see STAKE Did you find it  It s annoyingly difficult to find for me How do you find the APY  I ve been a bit frustrated searching for that info on the website before I deposit my Sol there If youre a long term hodler outside the US  binance runs 90 day  3 day unlock  14  apy hey  whats the original video s name That s Solana   The question is about Serum though But couldn t governance be decentralized  By voting on whether a validator should be slashed It doesnt for me for some reason   ive made trades there but nothing shows up Nice   It is tempting but I feel like I would burn myself no shit   Also  supply demand is literally what fundamentals mean    Price went down because more people sold then people bought    Cool   Good insight   The price went down because leverage got wiped  and the large portions of market got liquidated  then additional weak hands sold into it   That s it   I think you mean on short time horizons  news  market expectations  FUD  and leverage speculation drives markets   You still have sellers and buyers at any time horizon  which ultimately are the fundamentals in the crypto space   This isn t a physical commodity that is literally getting put on a boat and sent across the world   But yes  I agree  if you believe in SOL and are staking  shouldn t matter   Zoom out  go outside  don t follow hourly charts Good points  and yeah I see the advantage of ETH having first mover advantage  but then see apps like Audius already migrating part of it s operations onto SOL  Not sure if there are benefits to Audius using both technologies  or if this is a precursor to them fully moving to SOL   and what applications will follow  Thinking since its so hard to tell I might as well just hold both Yeah  FTX   I have access to up to 20x   I would never want to use that much with such a volatile asset Its more than just Ethereum  Its Ethereum  Cardano  Algorand  Tezos  Solana  The Internet Computer  etc   Pure speculation combined with a lack of actual adoption is what s providing such demand for so many blockchains  That s not to say any of them will just disappear  but I strongly believe that once adoption truly starts taking place there will be clear winners and losers  The  losers  will be the ecosystems that fail to achieve adoption from the big industry players  Once that occurs  the remaining chains will likely just facilitate smaller community style adoption  I think we will see speculation largely dry up for those  Just my thoughts  How things will shake out is anyones guess but I feel strongly that as blockchain matures there will likely be a handful of dominant chains Time in the market  gt  timing the market The answer is 0 The best traders will tell you to NEVER use leverage  It s the best way to blowout your account When you think about it  if you use leverage  it means you don t have the money to invest as much as you want  At the end of the day  you will do as you want but consider learning the trading curves  study and keep studying more   Easy money and trying to go too fast  like by using leverage  doesn t exist work  If you really want to be successful  you need to invest your time knowing what you do  Don t forget 95  of traders lose money because it is NOT easy How are you leveraging that much   Ftx   I was under the impression you had to have bigger balances to use leverage that way the short term threat I see is getting more developers comfortable in Rust and its lower level benefits   whereas ETH has first mover advantage  their move to POS lowers the rewards for validators  miners  so net  its very good news for SOL  i think ETH will continue to need L2s for a very long time as well and for big financial apps i dont see why anyone would would be looking at a slow second gen platform right now or in the years to come It looks promising imo The DeFi environment is pretty important   I m still looking for a pretty good AMM DEX and I m not aware of one  hints welcome   Metamask not integrated  the apps I tested
2021-05-25,31.39634748,33.13012834,26.10007356,I m definitely thinking this  like this is the last chance unless you re ready to wait a few years  I m a negative person though Feels neat to be here during its first tv appearance  could you image remember the first eth tv appearance and being all in no scared of a dip at all   feels good to see a dip since the blind buyers are now going to do more research before they jump back in   the shiny Bitcoin is wearing offf    time to look towards the source of new ecosystem energy    cheer on those devs    look to the sol That s the dip I got too  better than 50s but damn was I envious when I saw that 20 i believe that serum is essential due to the Orderbook  but I think it s telling that they re deprecating their own swap  and refer folks to use Raydium  Plus since raydium pools supply liquidity back to the serum orderbook  they are almost symbiotic  so both Sorry it s only 1k   not 10k How much did you lose though yea I bought the dip at 33 but then it dipped againactually it dumped who are we kidding One question which one is more important for solana eco system   serum or raydium I personally have  I think they re going to continue to be a key piece in Solana s defi ecosystem I think there needs to be multiple competitors in the same space for innovation to occur rapidly  That means multiple blockchain will need to coexist and eventually interoperate with each other Put a kidney up for sale on the black market that s what I m going to do lol Yep sold some of my cardano which I ve been staked in and bought a bag around 25  and staked them I saw it drop as low as 20  or even lower maybe oh well glad I got it for what I did Yeah seems like my checks never line up with dips You should never sell when it dips tho I managed to sauce it the best way possible  swapped half eth for a couple thicccc Sol girls   51     hours before it crashed      Luckily she is a bad bitch   an I love her  So I HODL and lock her away  ‍  ‍  ‍  in stake   I have 175 staked and 25 not staked in case I want to swap for serum or raydium or if the sort   I fucking love SOLANA I ll tel you that rn 300  end of year Yep  that s pretty much my conclusions too   No way to refresh mobile app that I can tell iirc you have to tap staking and the number displayed under unstake solana is your true balance  I think there s also a 4 day waiting period until your coins start staking Should I buy raydium Oh  snap  The coverage is great  but what really gets me excited is what this represents This is one of my gripes with Exodus too   Does the balance on the main page ever update with current balance from staking rewards   I ve been on it for 7 days and only see the number increase in the  unstake SOL  section Solflare is good too  Solflare allows you to choose a validator to stake with while Exodus automatically stakes only with Everstake validator Thanks I ve heard good things about SolFlare but I really don t like the use of the the  digital key file  and that they don t have a mobile app  They are also compatible with a few cold storage devices but I m not into that either  I personally use Exodus because of its convenience  By my calculations I m earning at closer to 6  but I haven t even staked for a month yet Good finding Read this  gt For example  a program executable with the size of 15 000 bytes requires a balance of 105 290 880 lamports      0 105 SOL  to be rent exempt    gt    gt 105 290 880   19 055441478439427  fee rate      128   15 _000  account size including metadata       365 25 2     2  epochs in 2 years I don t think we re in the clear yet  You still may have a chance This is dumb  It s simple   Most cryptos are blown out of proportion by people who don t understand the technology  At the end of the day what will matter is if useful things are built with the tech  And the chain used to build the best stuff stays around the rest disappear  like many early internet companies   What many all of the cryptos need is someone who can execute a product well to come along and build something useful  something which changes things  Then as more people use the product and thus the crypto  its price goes up  rewarding the early investors Sure  but this must not be inherently due to proof of work or proof of stake I mean I have my own explanation  and I think it is correct but I am getting the feeling that there is a lot of misinformation being spread in online forums due to economic incentives No way it fell to 19  for a second during the big crash now back to 30 33   marketing doesn t determine value of coin Really good stuff for sure  No problem  it s my pleasure to share with the community Polygon is a Pump and Dump for the moment before ETH2 then it will useless I think I saw it on their the other day   Step finance had a whole list of all the pools and yields as well that might help Yep  This was an outstanding showcase for Solana If you want get pumped about the future of Solana  listen to today s Unchained podcast  I hit pause  amp  bought another 5 SOL 1 2 through the conversion  https   podcasts apple com us podcast unchained id1123922160 i 1000523014032 See this   https   www etherchain org   https   www etherchain org  Each block on Ethereum  on average  is taking 13 seconds  as per above On Solana  each block is takes 400ms  Thus  32 5x faster to produce blocks than Ethereum Most crypto projects are still building their products right now  so marketing at this point is really limited to building awareness IMO  Cardano s marketing has mostly been done by the stake pool operators  who gain delegators by educating early adopters on platforms like Twitter and YouTube    It s too early for most cryptos to throw a ton of money at their products because they simply are not ready to deliver   Ethereum  for example  is about to undertake a massive shift as 2 0 rolls out   Plus  potential clients may not understand what the use case is  so corporate government adoption will take time too   As that happens  treasury s will grow  and marketing budgets will grow along with them   Bottom line is that we are still VERY early   Love Solana tho  spread the word Yes Huh  I didn t say any of that  You quoted  reversed the theft of some ETH  and said that was a  weird take  and that the ethereum community disagrees  I interpreted that as you saying that the chain wasn t rolled back and reorganized  Are you not saying that They are probably just waiting for the market to liven up with buying volume   Official announcement  https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2 I have the same issue  Sent a test amount of SOL from Exodus  to my sollet io wallet  and nothing came through When I click on the tx link  the Solana explorer can t find the transaction  What happened I m not familiar with Orca  I ll look it up Developers are attracted to platforms that have great tooling  scale  and are stable platforms for implementation and operation That s a good article to read  it s like AIO  All In One  source of information about Solana  amp  the main fast growing dApps buit on Solana Thank you for the article Doesn t Orca have one out Thanks Wow  that is amazing  We need more things like this    Transparency and information play an important role in consensus mechanisms 5 00 grams is 0 04 bananas heavyI am

is 0 06 Honestly  ICP sounds a bit far out there and I haven t had enough time to do a deep dive   I don t like their marketing and I really don t like how they just launched their token with a  50B marketcap   It does deserve more of a technical deep dive on my part though  just haven t had the time PK   for devs that refuse to learn Rust and will be building on a slower L1 Chainlink   a popular oracle for getting offchain data   but likely modern L1s may not need it as much in its current state Polygon   because eth2 will still have scaling problemsI prefer the SOL ecosystem even in it s infancy  Just familiar What s your opinion about the ICP for example Respectfully disagreeSolana s biggest problem is that it wasnt invented in 2015   I also think Solana is easy to understand in a simple table For the layman who barely understands what AWS is  what should SOL explain to them   A column comparing it to hosting your website or app on Dreamhost seems like a mean jokeThen you look at The Internet Computer and I cant even say that with a straight face si Im not understanding your point of view  There was a theft  ETH classic became a literal attack on ethereum  VB has been praised as both a technical and ethical leader unanimously by his users  and you find him unfit and untrustworthy To be fair  every other thread I m a part of is saying the same about those projects  The key thing to remember with Cardano is that old Hobbo was a part of creating Ethereum  That alone gave Polkadot and Cardano some of the biggest ICO s yet solidify their top 10 status  On top of that Hobbo over at Cardano absolutely hates how people keeps trying to shill that project and expect higher prices   he literally couldn t care where it sits that s not the goal of it  You have to understand the space has a stack of amazing tech building at the moment but it s all still growing  Until projects are ready for mass adoption  which most aren t  they are going to focus on the dev team and actually building the project first  I wouldn t worry about prices too much mate    the cheaper something is the more in can buy if you truly believe in it It will be  19 at the end of 21  if lucky  Due to lack of marketing  Also  admin updates on what s happening to SOL are missing  It has to come from the top to supporters  current investors and curious potential buyers Sorry  totally missed your message That message was posted in the Solana discord so join https   discord gg solana first and then click the link in the previous message  The message is still there so you should be able to get to it Poor marketing  Imagine what it s like also being an XLM holder haha Cardano has a leaderless consensus design   That s all that matters   Solana isn t that impressive  tbh Technical issue due to solana being too fast We dont need to know anything but this   Is it a good coin or bad coin   Do I buy or no Thanks everyone for the explanations Regarding the comparison with the stock    While I understand the value is subjective and people buy and sell all the time  ultimately the value is sort of based on EPS multiple  or what people believe EPS will be in the future  because as a stockholder you  own  the company and are entitled to dividends  if paid  ofc   As a Solana coinholder  how would we get value  Will the fees generated by the transactions be given to Solana holders How is that a weird take  That s exactly what happened  The entire community seems to think it was justifiable  but I don t think anyone can argue that hardforking the chain to exclude that theft is not somehow  reversing the theft I think raydium uses as a backend for orders  Serum is the powerhouse of sol ecosystem  Ray is a good project too Sounds good  Have you made a sale yet Everybody wants their coin to have better  marketing Re posting this because the comment chain it is in got a downvote to 0 because someone doesn t like the truth apparently https   stakeview appSearch for Everstake

think is what lead BTC to accepted as well as it has   It s marketing is much easier to digest   understand     Digital gold  or  store of value    Where as other cryptos referred to as electricity is simple in its terminology  but much more difficult to digest once you start doing the mental deep dive Can I ask  what happens if you have a bad i e  delinquent validator  Can you just de stake from them and reallocate  Thank you There is almost no risk when staking   There is a concept of  slashing  which could theoretically risk loss of stake rewards  and possibly even stake itself in egregious cases  but that is not implemented so cannot happen   I haven t even seen a roadmap for implementing slashing  so it seems we are all safe from it for the forseeable future Even if slashing were implemented  a  it would be super rare because no validator would perform the actions that would result in slashing  i e  voting in violation of certain voting rules   unless that validator were suicidal or something b  the risk can be mitigated simply by spreading stake to multiple validators  which you should do anyway When you stake you remain in complete ownership and control of your tokens   The other thing to keep in mind is that when you delegate stake  it takes until the next epoch boundary to become delegated  one to three days  and if you want to de stake  until the epoch boundary after that to de stake  three more days    So once you decide to stake  your tokens  although still yours  cannot be transferred for up to a week   If you want you could consider not being able to sell your tokens for a week  a risk  Sorry I read your question quickly and didn t notice the  of theft  part   To put simply   there is NO risk of    theft    from staking   The validator you stake to never has any control over your tokens   Your private key that gives you ownership of your tokens remains your private key and is never shared with anyone  so no one can do anything with your tokens except you    the standard risk of having your private key stolen because you didn t use sufficient security methods to protect it still applies of course  but that has nothing to do with staking  that s just a general risk of all crypto Everything around AMMs are worst at explaining what they do or how people can do thatWhen new farms  raydium lingo  pools  are launched  often people don t understand how to deposit  Sometimes you ll see answers like  just deposit your LP in the pool  or  get your LP first  in discord  which is basically useless for anyone new In case someone is interested  some of this stuff was discussed  here  https   www reddit com r solana comments n8jja8 raydium_raysol_pool_has_top_5_volume_out_of_all   Also I assume that even most DeFi people don t really understand the economic rational  e g  how LPing and Farming are very different  so they are sticking to their jargon  amp  are happy as long as  number go up I have been told by devs on Discord that there is an issue with the Serum dex suddenly submitting lots of transactions   not sure if they re bad transactions or good transactions that are just excessive  or what   This is combining with some lack of optimization in the solana code base to cause block generation to take a little too long  which then leads to other validators skipping that block This is all heresay though  I can t vouch for any of this being definitely true The devs claim to have some strategies for optimizing some of this but I really don t know what the solution will be or how long it will take to arrive   I guess that s why it s still  mainnet beta   lt shrug gt So weird it was suppose to be up yesterday I m familiar with etherium but can you explain why Polkadot Kusama  Chainlink  and polygon and why they will rise on top The price of SOL is mostly determined by that strange social phenomenon of value ascribing    It s the reason that stocks on the stock market are assigned value even though all that you are going to be able to do with the stock in 99 99  of cases is sell it to someone else   Crypto currencies are similar   Solana has practical value in that you can use it to pay the network to do useful things for you  but the vast majority of its perceived value comes from that strange human trait of assigning value based on a belief about others  assigned value In the world where Solana succeeds as well as we all hope  it s running 50 000 TPS and burning  50 per second in SOL while doing so   The continued desire of people to use the network and buy more SOL to pay more transaction fees for using the network  combined with the constrained supply  is what would keep the value of each SOL above some minimum But the majority effect will almost always be value ascribing Great advice   Other sources of information about validators https   validators app      for some details about how well validators are performing from a Solana network perspective  although I think their rankings are a little arbitrary  at least the data is there and you can deep dive into any validator you are interested in https   stakeview app     for pure and accurate details about validator APY returnsDisclaimer  I made stakeview app https   stakeview appI made this site because I want there to be accurate information out there   You should double check my work  there is no reason for you to believe me over anyone else  but I can explain my methodology and you  can  double check my values Any wallet that lets you at a minimum pick from multiple validators of your own choosing   I have heard that Solflare and Moonlet let you do that   There may be others It s funny you mention that  I just sold all my safemoon prior to the crash because of that exact reason  Yes I know it s your classic  shitcoin   I was impressed by their marketing  massive public following  and holders community obsession and loyalty  When it came time for them to not be a shitcoin and tell 2 million people who invested what the hell they are going to do  they had zero clue  It was going from wallet debit card  video games  NFTs  African currency lol  I said ok I m out  I have an appreciation of the work developers from the likes of Solana have done and the work they put in  knowing it s not an overnight project  Also  I know what happens when you start trying to do to much rather than one thing great when starting a business SBF They are talking about different thing a bit  you will be fine staking on exodus Any kind of transaction on the Solana network needs to pay transaction fee  similar to gass fee in ETH  and as more and more projects start to use Solana they need to buy and hold more and more coins and this is how usability will affect Solana Solana crypto  Ethereum killer Remember that stake should be decentralized and Exodus only allows you to stake with one of the largest validators already  Everstake   which leads to centralized voting power i e  hurts network security  I would recommend staking with Solflare  There you can stake with any  even multiple validators and improve network decentralization  Pick a validator you trust below the 1 3 cumulative stake line on  https   solanabeach io validators  https   solanabeach io validators The best thing we can do is educate others  create youtube videos  write blogs  design infographics   literally do whatever you can personally to show people the Solana s value Been waiting for this for a long time Well  buy it up before it catches on This is because most crypto projects kick off without asking themselves  What does this do   they just launch with dollar signs and Jargon then pander to the dev community in hope the devs will tell them what it could do and expose profitable uses   The primary team then will pivot to the dev sub project that is the most profitable   Startups are gonna startup    it s often half an idea and half bullshit in the beginning to get things going      Beyond a year or so though    the primary team should be able to explain their value and point of difference to competitors in 30 seconds or it s a rudderless ship Yeah that s probably the technical difficulty  they bought when the price was higher   ‍ ️ And what benefit will it have if the price of the token goes up  I mean I see that people can make money I guess but what is the benefit to the actual project I think the main question is to what benefit to the project is to pump up the price of the token  As we can see with ETH the gas fees are an issue  If the project wants to market itself on the basis of lower fees  among others  why would they want the price to moon  for whose benefit my guess is it s because of high liquidity and they want to do it on a more bullish trend because they buy before they list for sure Literally decided to invest in sol the day before the crash      but i have faith after reading what sol aims to do gt  old cryptocurrencies that are power hungry and killing the planet Stopped reading here  so weak pushing FUD in an attempt to promote their own shitcoin I would ask you to keep quiet so i can keep accumulating at this price range We dont now  They have to be more transparent about the listing That s what the other post in here talking about the marketing part and why solana isn t on top 5 is about  Took you a week to understand this  I really liked your explanation and eli5 example  But    people in general will go crazy like  what the hell they talking about    Thanks  mate  Really appreciate the info Delayed  No one is saying when Fix it People like products  People like to use things  People don t like to understand how something works or the tech behind it  And how do u  sell  things to people  Really good marketing  Lot of cases  u convince them they need that product in their life  Crypto doesn t got there  yet  The only ones around here are the ones who cared to do a little research about it or are already in this field enthusiasts   And those who see an opportunity to make money  but don t know anything about the tech or what it does exactly It was supposed to be yesterday at 9am but I still am unable to buy I consider myself one of those  illiterates  in crypto  Nonetheless  when I m reading and DYMOR I can grasp basic stuff  why these could be better than that other one  etc    but  I can t explain to others why that is  Another problem is the shitcoins scammers   Why isn t this one a scam like the other ones I ve seen   They may say it  What I think will solve this  practical use  Right now crypto may be in a phase that is more interesting for tech nerdy geeky people  They go a little deep and read search for better options  People with money  in general  just look at top 5  find if they can  make money  out of it and invest on it  They don t do research or anything  If solana goes  and I really think it will  top 5 10  they will put their money in it  But  until practical use  a looot of people won t make their moves into the crypto world  For me we re still early  Example of what I m trying to say  people use credit cards  Plastic cards that pay for things  They don t care how they work or the tech behind it  They just use it  When crypto chains start having friendly and really simple UI uses  it will skyrocket not sure If you should trust this one boys  this account is made to just shill coins by the look of it have a look through post history  just copy pastes to different subreddits a fair few got removed and people saying scam in the comments of older ones  As always DYOR If you re talking crypto prices  yes  we re still in a bubble where traders and influencers say ADA and everyone buys  If you re talking business  I think vision is what s really missing in this phase but just because nobody knows which direction this whole thing will take Cardano also has been on the scene for at least year and half No  your exchange sucks balls and your fees are abhorrent  Take your ad spam somewhere else As someone who has also finally gotten a few friends into crypto after weeks of trying to explain what it  actually  is under the hood  this is very accurate We need effective communicators to start hitting the scene in order to boil these projects down into something the average Joe can understand without writing a dissertation on software engineering These comments lmao  Fuck off with your pump and dump i tried to buy the dip but it took several days to get the fucking bank transfer done lol  Lesson learned Its a very fair question  but I don t think ethereum will be as cheap and have the same level of throughput  However thats all speculation until eth2 launches  This is critical for market makers and trading technology Really cool Informations mate  thank you See I m not quite sure how effective these types of arguments would be once Eth 2 launches with upgrades to scalability  Not trying to be a hater  but I m genuinely trying to imagine where Solana serves better As someone with a marketing company  the entire crypto industry has an issue with marketing  Nearly every project crypto can hardly explain their project in laymen terms so that every day people can become interested in it  Most cryptocurrency projects seems to be a circle jerk of tech words to look good for developers and a bunch of confusing jargon that no one has any clue what it is unless they re deep into crypto  in order to impress fellow developers  I can promise you the vast majority of potential investors and adopters of these projects do not care about POS vs POW  validator nodes  tokens  etc I ve literally talked to over 100 friends and family the last month about  None have a clue wtf is going on and how certain projects will change the industries they are in  Then when they read about them  the project does such a poor job at explaining it  it seems like BS  I m not talking about my boomer relatives  but friends I have who are very successful in the non tech corporate world  trying to grasp what these actually do  None of this is a slight at Solana  this is an industry wide rant Do you want to sell them You want to sell them I agree  DD is good and i love challenges so that  even if I am wrong I can have a more accurate view of the crypto space  Node requirements for solana are the only possible drawbacks  But i just dont view it as a big one  Anatoly recently said he is looking for someone who can help make a ps5 be able to run a node  because it has enough hardware to do so  Eth I would argue is not very decentralized rn because of mining pools  It will be with PoS  It will be the most decentralized  However  there comes a point imo where the tradeoff between decentralization and performance can and should be made  That point comes for me when everyone who is using solana can  if they wanted to  afford to run a node but choose not to  Cardano is even worse as far as node costs go  Also while anyone can start an ETH node with a raspberry pie  you have to stake 32 eth  Thats like 100k  Way less decentralized than solana  Lmk if they are gonna change that in the near future This could be HUGE  Where do I sign up at still yet TBD  This isnt FUD  this is DD and care consideration for the possibilities with our investments and not turning a blind eye to those cracks  I can counter argue some of those claims by going deeper  IE  more decentralized than eth     look at the node requirements for solana  we can argue all day  My point is dont be caught off guard if the worst is exposed  you cant say you didnt know werent aware of it   I know the pros and cons of all my projects  I dont see a perfect system yet  and even the top academics and top programmers engineers in crypto dont see a perfect system either Its been up and running for over a year  There is plenty of incentive for people to try to fuck with it  There is also a testnet where hackers are paid to try to fuck with it  Over 1 400 nodes  I would compare security to eth  Especially since eth is switching from pow to pos  the security of the chain and the transition i would say it lessend than solana which has been pos for a year  I do own eth  because network effect but solana can really outperform over the long run  Look at all the devs who are switching over  Big time devs like creator of maker and the ceo aave etc  are sponsoring and getting involved in solana It is decentralized  Please watch this video  It will explain alot https   youtu be TS2mSjvE3Ok Its not decentralized   As far as secure  TBD  PoH and is novel and new  yet to be tested  Scalability yeah for sure Perfect  i just voted for Solana too Come on guys  we have 19k in here  if we just get 5k only to vote  we will win this Poll Voted for SOL as always I like to see it there I just voted for Solana   Commented Thank you for this  Let s do it folks You re discounting a lot here  Cardano took time with peer review to prove it can scale to billions of users in a secure and de centralised way  It s at it s market cap because it s already de centralised  got staking right in a user friendly way  it has cemented deals with entire countries   markets itself very well and is on the verge of releasing smart contracts  Much of the pricing is anticipation  If Cardano can pull off smart contracts in the way it says it will  easy migration from other chains  ability to use multiple programming languages like Java  C    rust and python  it s value will rocket  All of that is an if though  They may not pull it off  If you or I knew the answer to that we d be millionaires I the future stable coins will be used to pay for day to day transactionshttps   youtu be WDSY8JXF9j0Watch that video between visa  sam bankman fried  CZ So the question becomes  which chain can be the most efficient in moving stable coins around If Sol accomplishes this  sol will be required for gas fees and for moving transactions Serum will be used to swap from stable coins to individual token assets  like NFTs  other tokens etc   or trading on solana etc At least that s how I see it Ethereum  Polkadot Kusama  Chainlink  Polygon and Solana will be on top of the crypto world  Just a matter of time Website looks scammy  Be careful folks Thnx Ok so I signed up and used FTX   the technical implementation of that site is SO GOOD I wished they supported more currencies and had other financial products  It s excellent Where did you find it  I looked all over Coingecko  CMC  and Raydium Dex Yes Y x3 I m not heavily invested in bitcoin but bitcoin is good for eth and good for alts  Good analysis and like the other commenter said  no annoying hype gt  ignored Looks fabulous  I want a piece I already asked The thing is  there s so many  alternatives that could dethrone BTC and Eth that are already a better solution Solana isnt the only one  I m almost positive one will end up as the new defacto  but I cant say if its Solana  Algorand  Elrond etc    there s so many so diversify I don t why don t you ask their discord lol they re active  I don t understand why you re asking in solana sub Awesome Sounds cool  looking forward to seeing what you come up with  Sent a piecette for support  Cheers guys Appreciate the info Because serum swap used in house pools and didn t use serums order books  ironically  Swaps on raydium  and on every other app on solana  use serum and provide liquidity to the order book   So   serum decided to use the recourses for other things rather than Keeping it on Why is that Serum swap has been deprecated There s a lot of building on KIN which is part of the ecosystem  Here s a good place to start that s relative and recent   https   cuppakin com fiyer ama announcement   https   cuppakin com fiyer ama announcement Serum swap literally never works for me though I want it to  I end up always using Raydium Most definitely  I think once we stabilize in a few weeks we may get some news about it but will re enter at around  18  25 before that news But i dont know why should be a dev anonymous in this time were the crypto Industriy is full of scams Raydium uses the Serum Dex s Orderbook  In fact  most of the dexs on Solana do  Raydium is your best bet as the go to dex on Solana s defi right now  They have lots of liquidity  fast trades  and plenty of farming and pool options  I should add the Serum Swap is technically available but it was deprecated in favor of Raydium Agreed  Wouldn t surprise me if they delayed it because the market was going through the worst dump in recent history  Wouldn t have been a good look  Especially to newer investors A must listen for everyone in here  It features Kain Warwick  founder of Synthetix  who takes the Ethereum side of the debate and Kyle Samani from Multicoin Capital who is tasked with arguing more for Solana BSC although Multicoin also holds a huge position in Ethereum themselves  They end up talking more about Solana than BSC  which is pretty interesting  Samani makes a bunch of tremendous points about the future of Solana and why he is so bullish on it  it s an alltogether amazing listen for people who are optimistic on this ecosystem Same at 47 and at 37 then I realized we re in a panic selling zone so gonna wait a few more weeks to re enter Is there a source  Twitter  blog etc we can follow for updates or announcements about this  I tried Google  but no luck and the Sol Twitter isn t providing updates No I don t think so  We re in a panic selling phase  We ll start seeing significant leg ups end of June into July then into August IMO Did you notice that the whole market was going up in unison yesterday  That s a big red flag but we re going to be just fine Hey sorry  Had a problem with the video Just updated the link now Thank you so much Any reason you deleted the vid Looks like papa s found himself a new gem   Lorax for the win  Loaded to

charity funding Yes Yes solana Has anyone built on solana and ethereum  Curious which is generally easier to develop on gt reversed the theft of some ETHWeird take  Literally the entire Ethereum community disagrees Here s a great first Example  Solanium just launched their permissionless pair today  SLIM SOL  https   twitter com RaydiumProtocol status 1397160082664611841  https   twitter com RaydiumProtocol status 1397160082664611841 The mist important what a learned in my short time in crypto TAKE PROFIT never be greedy Serum  You can think of raydium as a face of serum  bonfida as well  and any other AMM dex interface out there on solana  On any other blockchain  liquidity would have been held within that same app  For example all liquidity on uniswap  in on uniswap  Not with serum  Any app can hook up to serum and provide liquidity and access the liquidity of all other apps from the solana ecosystem  As mentioned below it is symbiotic  and as more apps connect then the liquidity becomes better and transactions faster and smoother  That s what a central limit order book is Genius really I ve been staking on Exodus for about a month now and it  varies from 6 8 5  by my calculations  There may be some exaggeration but the APY also depends on inflation  Either way  even at 6 8  we re on par with your average Boomer 401k with the possibility of the 10 1000x upside based on the underlying appreciation I had a few coins back when it was 14  This past week has allowed me to jump in again     Where is the best info on staking SOL PUMP SOLANA Right  I hope the entire market stays low til the end of the month  Hoping I can yolo a chunk of my pay check on cheap crypto lol English Solana fees are too high  For a few tokens  is better to use exchange stacking  Even binance is offering 10 How isnt it  It decentralized  fast  and secure it will only become more decentralized over the next year I don t think we re entering   I think we already are  My personal feeling is we re in a bull trap at the moment before a big crash I have liked Moonlet wallet so far  Simple and easy to use Let SOL be at a discounted price so that I could buy more Thanking you  That was a worry of mine with exodus  The  apy being misinterpreted DCA all the way to hell I did   47 if that makes you feel better I m knee deep in Solana and ran out of funds to buy the dip  I believe in the project on the long run   Never selling Yes  solstake ioBackground  Some friends and I are currently working on a project for the Solana hackathon which is designed to make staking as easy as possible   its still being built but you can paste you wallet public key If you like it please let us know and follow our Twitter  solstakeio Bear with us as we re ironing out lots but any feedback thoughts  or a vote later on   would be much appreciated Very well explained What would you recommend SOL has been on a discount for sometime now Thanks thanks We are all going to be very happyHolders in 5 years Edit  thanks for the share  We need this sort of boost and validation during the hard times Usually  I just paste my staking address save in notepad   to  Solanabeach io You can view it over there https   explorer solana com  and use your staking address to see the balance Mmmmhmmmm I did  At 40 Do you have any idea why the skip rate is high I d hold COPE in the solwallet to guarantee airdrops I got 16 sol  what does this mean if I stake them on exodus  I am lost for words with this wizardry A doubter is a pouter Yes  would like to back test it  Do you know any cool back testing tools templates gotcha   you think we entering bear market Proof Maybe serum concentrate on building ecosystem inside itself to provide better service to consumer I m not suggesting anything  but Solanas isnt made for this specific thing 4 days after the re listing announcement you sound like an ez fish to hook Agreed Oh I do believe in Solana  I believe in a lot of crypto projects  But whatever happens to bitcoin effects the entire market  Look at what happened in 2018  and look at the charts now  I m not saying it will definitely drop  but if history repeats itself we re heading for 15 20k BTC and thus everything else will fall by 70 80  as it has done before It s the future   Pretty cool they did itI m curious how reviews work on the decentralized web  Age of wallet and contents are a valid user   How do you figure out customer reviews when you don t trust anyone In the context of trustworthy pools  good experience using  and so on  just as an example  Or is a centralized web better for this sort of thing Centralization  Gotcha Yeah  no  For what it s worth  yes solana is indeed fast  possibly the fastest current blockchain platform   But it has not solved the blockchain trilemma  and it isn t the closest to doing it either Proof of History isn t a consensus mechanism  Solana uses Proof of Stake consensus like most other crypto projects  Proof of History is just a timestamping technique  Its what allows Solana to be hyper performant As for why other projects aren t using it  well because it uses the SHA 256 hashing algorithm to timestamp blocks  and tons of crypto projects opted not to use SHA 256  As for the rest of them that did  I imagine that its likely a nightmare to port that functionality into your blockchain  It might not even be possible without hard forking your project My biggest concern about the project is the coin vesting schedule  They haven t exactly been open about it  The one online interview with Anatoly giving an answer to the question of the vesting schedule had his answer edited out  That doesn t exactly inspire confidence cheers ETH Classic forked because Vitalik reversed the theft of some ETH by executive fiat  Things didn t go his way  his project was exploited in a way he didn t forsee  so he took his ball and went home  He s the absolute last person who should be talking about small groups of elites making decisions that benefits their revenue first  The fork of ETH and ETH Classic should have been all the proof anyone should ever need that Vitalik isn t someone to be trusted with any sort of power there is no easy way until a central exchange available to NYers like coinbase  coinbase pro  or gemini  start supporting SPL tokens https   www reddit com r solana comments ndmqe7 purchasing_sol_in_nyc https   www reddit com r solana comments n3l7ov how_can_i_buy_sol_in_new_york This Buy Raydium  and join an LP or Fusion Pool at Raydium io You don t believe in the project  Can you tell me what reasons  I m thinking of investing but would like to hear the other side For three reasons 1  They are oversized   Ideally you d stake all your stake with validators below the  censorship line    Everstake is already  3 in size and only growing   It s bad to concentrate stake in large validators because it leads to centralized power in the network 2  They exaggerate their APY   They do not get the 10   they claim  they actually only get a little over 8    I consider misrepresenting your APY for the purpose of growing an already oversized validator even more  to be really bad form 3  Their wallet  Exodus  does not support spreading stake among multiple validators   It s really greedy to not support that feature  all users should demand that all staking front ends support splitting stake across multiple validators   It is quite simply the best thing for the network and it s irresponsible to not support it Those are the reasons that I say Exodus Everstake is bad for Solana I made this video yesterday when the market was way down  First of all  the price of the coin has doubled  I didn t buy any yet because I need to move more funds to Solana  It takes some time and I am working on it and hope to be ready as more projects launch and stuff gets going  SolFarm is in place to be the first place to find a yield aggregator vault  Holders of the new Tulip Tokens will be able to vote for projects in or out of the vaults  They will also be able to help pick out the rewards rates of Tulip going forward  This isn t live yet but that is the kind of stuff that will drive value to the token  They also now are tradable on Raydium but that happened today so it was missing from the video  Because users can add it to LP pool now Solflare with Ledger is the best option for long term staking time it right and to the mooooooon SOL is OP make sure you have the correct crypto to fiat selected  I was in ftx usd and realized that I should ve been in ftx usdt for my buy  Maybe this will help you with the situation Dead cat I should have known when those certain ppl reach out and start asking about crypto Binance Holding SOL  Cope  Rope  Serum  Kin in my TrustWallet  Frog  Woof and Dogana in my SolWallet  is not holding everything in my SolWallet prevent me from occasional Airdrop 1 on Raydium The answers above  As I ve read through this sub and I m not a crypto expert  I m looking at 500 1k dollars  I live in Brazil  so  I ll probably be able to  retire  if I want and have one minimum wage to live off   Btw  one minimum wage here is around 200 250 dollars and it s the default retire plan when u get to 60 65 years old KIN made like 50 million accounts  so for them  the rent exempt minimum is significant If you have a coin that is so value less that you can t even monetize your user base for more than 0 0026 SOL per user  you re probably doing something wrong I don t understand exactly what you are suggesting   That all these coins and accounts get to be made for free   That wouldn t work Exodus is convenient but why are they bad SolFlare is a good platform to stake but the only downside I see is that we have to store the Keystore file in a safe place just like how we store the seeds  The keystore file is required to login to the SolFlare wallet and access the staking page  Other than that I like SolFlare very much FUCK EXODUS SOLFLARE Exodus exaggerates their APY   Their APY is mediocre at best Yeah  I m in like  500    50 CDN Literally crashed after I bought lol Not Exodus   They re bad for Solana Per CB  when the liquidity is met  Looks like not many have transferred their SOL to CB yet Pretty sure Serum runs on AWS too   It s hard to get around this right now Imagine thinking running nodes on aws is decentralized lol Just bought some dip and immediately turned and staked it  Sol is on sale  take advantage Well said and appreciate your response

The exact number may vary as validators and service providers earn compensation  but the number is not expected to fluctuate by more than 5   The exact time is determined by the stake weighted average of dates submitted by validators  These tokens include   Employees and Service Providers   18 282 534 have been committed through contracts with service providers as part of ongoing or completed efforts  Many of the contracts specify a vesting schedule with various dates to consider   7 172 862 are projected to have been earned and will unlock on January 7th  2021   SAFT Investors  All of the SAFT investor tokens will be unlocked at the same time on approximately January 7th  2021  The amount of SAFT investor tokens is  176 949 616   Founders  Half of the founders  tokens will be unlocked  This amount of Founder tokens currently expected to be unlocked on January 7th  2021 is  31 250 000  The remaining half of the founders  tokens will unlock monthly over the following 24 months   Validators   3 271 751 have been committed through contracts with validators as part of ongoing or completed incentivized testnet events and work on mainnet beta as of May 1st  2020  Not all of the

fully unlocked  The remaining SOL that are earned will have various unlocking dates through May 2021   Community and Foundation  Remaining tokens are held by the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs  The Community Pool is not currently locked in a smart contract  as has been the case since the token generation event  However  as outlined above the Solana Foundation has committed to introducing no more than  8 000 000 into the circulating supply each calendar month through the end of 2020  and will  to the best of its ability  provide transparency into these activities through reports such as this one  The  8 000 000 per month applies only to tokens held by the Foundation or Solana Labs  including any inflationary rewards earned by either entity Dude come on be serious we are talking 7 digits Don t forget staking Totally fair  I have the same fears about losing my cold wallet but as you say it is the most secure solution otherwise  Thx for the explanation Solana needs to break into that top 10  People will start paying attention quickly after that Alright Solana  quit messing around  It s time you are a top 10 coin Currently at about 60  41 is staked cause I love the network Thanks There was a  000005 fee to stake  Not sure about unstaking  Haven t done that yet you can stake in phantom 6 digits by 2030 Hard pass  nice one lol Is there a fee to unstake So which of these do you think is the best way to divide  Best for the people  that is I just got my first 20  too  Twinsies NY politicians wants to keep Wall Street happy so they can get board seats when they retire Binance Solana Research  https   research binance com en projects solana I seriously read your comment that you puked up Solana  I want to take you out for some drinks now According to Binance research 3 2

35 SOL and with higher volume Nobody can really guarantee a rate since it s based on inflation  Admittedly  I don t know enough about inflation in a crypto context Anything to knock Ether down a peg or 2 would be nice Why do they say 10 8 then Even though I don t like to keep crypto on exchanges  I might rather put it on ftx and stake it there It will be available when sol hits all time high ok I haven t yet  just figured I d ask before I did  How do I go about bridging it and thank you very  much for letting me know Solfarm io Thanks for the feedback Hopefully Coinbase gets its shit together soon  and as long as you can still buy it under  40  you re good That s neat  man  I keep buying when it dips and sell when it reaches an high  Really exhausting but yeah  Unsure how long I can do this for  The indicators  price alerts and limits are all good but it gets exhausting and time  amp  attention demanding  What do you recommend I used exodus   paying out closer to 6 8  after 1 month It s still delayed I reckon triple digits by end of the year at a minimum I was talking about bitcoin Brady has been pumping it for months Your wife has good taste Nice buy price jay my man Way to build a welcoming community here  chief Coinbase don t have to sell anything  why you make you think so  The liquidity is based on the amount of SOLs in people s accounts  And then the order book will adjust the price    They don t have to sell anything Great future ahead Excellent choice Just pkd up my 122 Solana  Consolidated alts and bought  Big upside here all future predicts are close but all in 1000 00 range 2024 2025 Mark Cuban knows his shit  that s a helluva endorsement  And btw  for anyone who doesn t think he knows his shit  I d suggest watching this  Dudes legit  Hopefully Sam can get him on board https   www youtube com watch v V1 5IKj6fHs I use ftx  Easy to setup and does the job    10  annual Possibly a legit technical issue  but I think Coinbase doesn t want to sell all their SOL at  25 How is he obviously pumping it  He told SBF to DM him bro    thats it  And yea  Im fairly certain he s not broke  His wife alone is worth like half a bil  Either way  I didn t come here to argue about Tom Brady  You don t like the guy then fine  but if when he becomes involved with Solana  it will not be a bad thing  and it will benefit all of us im trying very hard to be a sol maximalist but it s pretty hard ngl Use solflare  You may not get the best returns but it s the most secure way of earning on your sol  Eventually PsyOptions will get built out and you ll be able to write options on your sol  probably per 100 tokens like stock options   amp  I think this will be an important part of the ecosystem He s obviously pumping it  Right or wrong  Maybe you don t know as much about his financial situation as you think you do Get some btc  set up a sollet wallet  amp  send btc to it  Trade that btc for usdt  Trade that usdt for sol  You ll need some sol for gas tho    set up your wallet  amp  send me your address I can help out There are a few that aren t like Brady  Cuban  etc  doesn t change the fact MOST are washed looking for a payday You dumb bitch  Read my first sentence  You must not understand English You get rewarded in Exodus every Epoch   meaning every 2 days  The exodus app is kind jenky and it won t show this on your  balance   It always stays the same and ppl on the Exodus sub always freak out lol  If you just click a few tabs and go to where you stake it on the app in the first place you see your rewards being added to your balance and if you wanted to unstake your original amount plus your rewards it would take 2 days to process  Again  your balance will NEVER change   you need to review your rewards in the stake tab It s stupid because coinbase people are going blto buy at higher prices  It s probably really a technical issue Rather than decisions of when Not true  Mark Cuban just invested in polygon  Love him or hate him he s not washed up How many days does it take to get your reward after you stake  moonlet takes 2 3 days Moonlet  11 62 I can t find Solana on KuKoin Welcome to the club  wagmi Why does a VPN not help again I am pretty sure KuKoin doesn t require full disclosure of identity other than a phone number or something  KuKoin probably wouldn t care  Not sure if they sell Solana though Buy usdc in coinbase pro  Create and FTX us account but don t register your identity  Deposit usdc into FTX and but sol with usdc gt Believing in the foundations of a technology is a good way to find a place for your moneyThis  I invest in things I believe in  but I also don t invest in them to lose money either congrats Exodus says 10 8 Agreed Why do people put money into stocks or 401ks  To see ROI It s called investing for a reason  Believing in the foundations of a technology is a good way to find a place for your money  but you better believe ROI plays a roll in almost everyone s investing choices Nawww MAGA Tom is hard pass Maybe try thorchain or a decentralized exchange Here s a recent vid with one of the people in charge   https   youtu be RxAwD9Yx7VU  https   www youtube com watch v RxAwD9Yx7VU amp t 1007s It really comes down to whether you think the project has good fundamentals and the team are still fully invested  If they are then it s an opportunity to get it at a big discount right  And if they aren t the don t have anything to do with it I ordered one from their store as well   When did you order and how long did it take to ship   I haven t received any type of shipping notification NODo not send it directl to your ETH address  You will need to bridge it I m right there with ya  bud  Dying to get started on my Solana journey and am blocked at every turn because I live in New York  Looked into FTX US today and that was a big nope  Long past Binance and other obvious choices  Searching  SOL  about every 15 minutes on Coinbase Pro hoping it will pop up  Why  NY  why   I m so sick of the restrictive regulations in this state  Digital asset exchange should be all or nothing countrywide  If they continue to restrict access I hope it escalates the flight out of NY and they lose billions in lost taxes That was me  Solana needs a face  but I wasn t expecting Tom Brady It makes Tom Brady look broke  What  Do you understand how much money he s made in his career  Do you know who his wife is Thanks  BTW  where is your validator located  If I recall from previous discussions here  you re in the US right  Also assuming you re Shinobi  I did finally get a Ledger so I may revisit this and go back to Solflare since I understand it supports Ledger Get real  solana is beta still  Thats why some apps haven t been able to implement it full scale Does anyone know what the network fees look like when you want to unstake and withdraw your SOL Go rattle the guys at Coinbase and ask why they stalled this week on letting people trade solana gt Honestly I don t think it makes the industry look bad  it makes those individuals look broke tho I mean  look  I get it  he s a meathead football player right  But maybe just maybe he s not as dumb as you think  If he were broke he wouldn t have played on a discount in NE as long as he had Hi ftx is an exchange  I think most people use Exodus wallet  which s pays about 8 It s surprising to see Brady  It s usually washed up celebs trying to make money again  Honestly I don t think it makes the industry look bad  it makes those individuals look broke tho  There needs to be someone super credible that s liked  Unfortunately Elon is perfect If that was true then Doge would already be at 1  or more since its the most advertised crypto besides Bitcoin You can stake it on ftx for 10  annualised return paid hourly with a 7 day lock up period  That s a relatively easy way of doing it without much faff been wondering the same  ive been using the alpha dashboard and while its still very simple i like the job it does  looking to see the price recover but wondering if when Thank you  Appreciate the kind words and the feedback Sol  working smart contracts  ADA   Imaginary ones Once the bridging from Solana to ETH is done  confirmed   of course you ll get the original ETH again into your ETH address  If things didn t go well for some reason  contact    Serum Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6    amp  post your problem in   Sollet   channel If you re goal is to let it sit  you may want to look into staking it  If you stake it  you can gain APY on the staked coin  As for keeping it in multiple wallets  if you lose access to a wallet you are literally SOL  sh t outta luck   so to have it spread  you won t lose all of it if a wallet is lost For the staking  I just setup a SolFlare account yesterday and staked delegated about  450 worth  On the next epoch  it should activate on the delegated node and I ll start gaining interest paid in Solana If you are curious how to stake and delegate  it s best to figure that out on your own so you ll have a better memory on the process Hope this helps Amazing  simple  amp  straight to the point  community definitely needs simple   How To   stuff like this   PS    Edit your main post  amp  add a link to your   Part I video    it will be good IMO Different wallet means more security  if one wallet got compromised  you have the other ones as backup  so you don t loose everything in one single wallet hack  if it happens  Avoid using your crypto browser  GoogChrome  FireFox  Brave  Opera  whatever      into something else  That s what i do  i have a whole Browser just for Crypto thing  exchanges  trading  wallets       just to have some Extra Security IMO    Having your big chunk assets into a hardware   Paper wallet is the best you can do    Store your assets into an offline storage device is also a good choice The above mentioned are just extra paranoia of myself when it comes to crypto That s what i call a real SOLdier Did not know that These are fantastic u ansi09  Thanks for doing these  keep them coming Ok I have a similar question  if I send wrapped eth from solong to metamask  will it show up as regular eth in my metamask VHS and Betamax could coexist in harmony  Betamax went away I m curious  is there a way for me to tell the start stop dates for prior epochs  I ask because I moved some things around and pulled out of Exodus and just got back in with 1000 sol on 5 5  however  I m not sure when it was finally staked and earning  What I do know is that so far on that 1000 sol I ve earned 3 46 Exodus IS NOT 10 35    It just isn t   I can give you at least three ways to prove that Exodus  returns are a mediocre  for Solana  7 97  over the past 42 days https   www reddit com r solana comments nkawma best_place_for_rewards_and_to_stake_sol gzfk9ay I personally am adverse to cold storage because I m afraid I ll lose it or lock myself out  It has the benefit of being virtually unhackable but also riskier to keep track of that thing  Ironically the iPhone is probably one of the most cyber secure places to have your crypto wallets but this too isn t full proof and nothing really is  I m also lazy  so exodus  only  giving me 6 8  is still an par w 401ks but with the added benefit of crazy upside I have both too  Good points discussed above I hope a few blockchains can co exist together so everyone is a winner This needs an NSFW tag Great read  Thnx Curious why you think the option to stake on Solflare using a cold wallet is  problematic   I ve been exploring this option but haven t pulled the trigger yet I owned both SOL and ADA probably more heavy into ada  After reading thru SOLs whitepaper and using apps on their ecosystem  I sold my entire ADA holding and moved into SOL The reality of the matter is this  Cardano has been around since 2017 and only really became  decentralized  this year  still no smart contracts  Charles Hoskins was an OG from ETH which pioneered smart contracts  but still did not push anything out  even for a testnet  might be wrong here  just going based on what I read   So tell me how is ADA valued at  58 Billion with no apps  no smart contracts  but just based on so called  partnerships   The reason is hype  Charles is a master of marketing and shilling the shit out of ada whenever he can On the other hand  SOL solved some pretty big issues with consensus speeds by incorporating a time system at the center of its consensus algo  Doing that   having an entire ecosystem of apps running on main net  SOL scaling of hardware means the transaction throughput will increase as computers advance  SOL is moving fast and doing it under the radar  They don t have to hype the chain to get users developers  they are naturally coming due to the experience  Ultimately they are getting real world scenarios running on the chain which is giving them a huge advantage to become the AWS of the public blockchain world  Whereas ada spending so much time researching and not testing is more likely to become the Google In the cloud world gt publish0x com stever   Probably because they what some privacy   If I was building something with as much financial upside as a yield aggregator on Solana  I would not like personally identifiable information on the internet Exodus is 10 35   I know they use Everstake  but at least for their arrangement with Exodus  that s what they re offering As for compounding it was not a feature when I was using Solflare  Like I said  I was told this changed  but it wasn t available even a few weeks ago when I moved my stuff to Exodus Either way  it s a temporary solution for me  Yes it would be best to use Solflare  but also yes  it s a fuckin PITA and most people aren t going to want to bother when there are easier options  This is another item that needs worked on IMO because it s not nearly as easy and straightforward as it ought to be Using solflare and ftx  Solflare is currently returning 6 8  varying thru the epochs  Ftx is giving a flat 10  paid out hourly So basically you re just looking for a certain type of influencer  I mean  that s all well and good  but your average person is not ever going to be into this stuff for the reasons you and I are and you need to understand that Exodus does not have a competitive APR  https   stakeview appExodus stakes with Everstake and you can see that it s WAY down on the list every epoch   It is beaten easily by tiny validators who have high 10  commission All staking compounds on Solana   ALL OF IT  REGARDLESS OF VALIDATOR   So that s not even a feature Exodus does not pay 10   It has a very mediocre returns  And it concentrates all your stake in one oversized validator  It s not what anyone should be using to stake Solana https   www reddit com r solana comments nkawma best_place_for_rewards_and_to_stake_sol gzfk9ay Awesome  thanks Marketing is all about  image  and mental association my friend  A comprehensive project like Solana would benefit from this type of marketing if it was supported by tech CEOs or prominent industry figures  When you get a quarterback who has no background in any sort of tech it s association now isn t one of high quality  because what the hell does Tom Brady know about crypto  Are you more likely to take a project seriously being touted by Tim Cook and Bezos or Tom Brady and Mahomes Regarding your comment on ROI  yeah ROI is great   it s why we re here  That being said people jumping in purely for profits and no interest in tech cause hyper volatility and a community of degenerate gamblers  Celebrities with no knowledge of crypto are conducive to these very conditions Marinade is liquid staking  Check it out here   https   marinade finance   https   marinade finance  And no  there are no browser wallets similar to metamask that offer it and not sure if any are looking to What s marinade  Do you know if there s any wallets that will offer staking that are also trying to be a  Metamask  type wallet  I use Math Wallet  amp  Coin98 for Solana DEXs but as far as I know they don t offer staking Until such time that marinade  or something similar  is finished  I just use exodus  It s a competitive apr and they auto compound  although someone did tell me solflare has auto compounding now  but I ve not confirmed I m not really a fan of web wallets but I like the integration with Ledger  I ll check this out  thanks Can you explain color Huh  interesting  I would love to know how much infighting there was when http and the other early internet protocols were emerging   It ll be interesting to see which technology rises to the top  I know adoption and marketing matter a lot  but even more so functionality and ability to integrate or form the new back end for legacy systems I ve been following some of the Hedera discussions groups  They re planning to use sharding to improve tps once they run out of throughput without it  According to Dr Baird  it sounded like one would want to split up data between shards for security purposes  I e  while it would be feasible to have a single credit card processor stores all of their data in a single shard  it would be safer to have it stored in multiple shards  although he seemed to feel that a single shard can be made as secure as an unsharded system if you have enough nodes validators in each shard  What sounds like it gets really complicated is bridging between shards  So say you are trying to have compose a Dapp that needs to find and pull data from more than one shard  you now are interacting with multiple shards  and the problem grows as the number of shards increases  I m not a dev  so take it was a grain of salt as I really don t understood enough about these protocols  Anatoly s argument that you are best to avoid it unless you can t avoid it is compelling  Similar with the layer 2 solutions for eth  If you don t have to go there  maybe don t go there  Every time you introduce complexity you need to spend more time and effort on building out interoperability  Although certainly not everything needs to interact with other projects It is a web interface  Currently the only wallet integrated with Ledger  Solflare com Is Solflare a web wallet or software wallet Solflare with Ledger is the safest long term staking method I wouldn t put an end date in just yet  Things are gonna get spicy over the next month  May futures expire this Friday  and quarterly futures expire end of June  Futures are always short Well doge doesn t exactly have a blockchain for developers to really build anything on Sent you a DM Can you screenshot so i post it into Sollet  Serum Discord   May be there is a way to   merge   those 2 accounts into 1 single KIN SPL I ve worked at a marketing firm and this is a color by numbers kind of influencer activation lolHow many signoffs did this take  I wonder you need to use the   with rewards flag Lmao  let Sam talk and do the marketing There sure are Definitely  I have plenty of SOL in my sollet  But now I have a KIN SPL wallet inside my KIN SPL wallet  and I have no idea how to access it Phantom  sollet  solong   all good Exodus   desktop wallet  Your keys  your coins I m not gonna lie  it is frustrating sometimes to see obvious areas of improvement like this that aren t there yet  At the same time though  I realized this project was going to win when I was watching an interview with Anatoly and he said that he is singularly focused on building and improving the chain  specifically pushing the performance to the max they can achieve  Like they said  ironically  in their promotional bits for the hackathon  if you build it  they will come  All of these issues with UI  marketing and documentation will be solved in time by the folks that are best able to solve them  In the meantime the founders  who are serious engineers and not design ppl or marketing ppl or whatever  are focused on the things they should be focused on and not hosting their own youtube channel and shilling bullshit  etc Their documentation could use some work too  For instance  many here  myself included  became interested in running a validator node  but their documentation is sparse and missing a lot of key bits  I generally give them a pass though cuz these are serious engineers who are singularly focused on building and improving the chain  however  they def need to get some people on the team to handle all of the areas where they are deficient now that they re experiencing greater adoption https   docs solana com

idea about this      IMAGE    https   i postimg cc BbmnknHF image png    2QK9vxydd7WoDwvVFT5JSU8cwE9xmbJSzeqbRESiPGMG You ll need to have some SOL in your Sollet BEFORE sending your KIN there  That amount   0 0025 at least  will be the Fee of minting your KIN SPL version in your Sollet wallet Exodus seems to be the easiest via it s mobile app  It s advertises 10  APY   I ve been staking for a month and it s closer to 6 8   I ve staked half of my SOL here  I plan to stake the half when I set up Solflare   Supposedly solfalre is better but if doesn t have a mobile app and requires you to store a digital key file on your laptop or cloud in order to access the wallet  It s also cold storage compatible   both of these things seem a little problematic to me but you apparently get a better APY and can choose your own validator  Hope this helps Totally   average consumers have no understanding of telecommunications but can use a phone quite happily  Average consumers can use a bank account without understanding how banking works  If you are investing you can know very little and happily speculate although as you learn more you ll probably put up a bigger proportion of your stack  In any good product the user doesn t have to grasp the underlying  otherwise what is the roleOf the developers  PS solana is a growing ecosystem and we ll have our day in the sun dw bout cardano ADA is for the shills Ask in the kin foundation subreddit  Theres some really helpful people there How is that not legit  Is that not a correct statement  A smart contract block chain that has no smart contracts  and has been around since 2017  seems pretty sus to me  but ymmv  And even if it was ready  there is no developer support  What it has going for it against Solana is a grifter salesman  people who shill on YouTube and a price that is attractive to n00bs I watched half on my way to work  It s a good show actually   The barrier to entry in running your own node and the devolving language for each chain both have pros and cons But not Kin I ve been learning development still a beginner  for both chains  I think I can give you a decent comparison Speed   Solana is pushing 50k TPS when required compared to ADA s expected 50 TPS for Gougen  Fees on ADA are in the same boat  Solana blow s ADA out of the water Marketing  Cardano has the best marketing in Crypto  The fact that they are at their market cap without smart contracts and low TPS is a true testament at their ability to create a brand  Solana is doing a good job in my opinion marketing but it s been pointed out that there are a lot of areas to improve and they don t hold a candle to Cardano s marketing  Dev experience  Bit biased but I dislike Haskell  Cardano has some very nice UI s for testing transactions but I don t really need that  What is nice about Cardano is that you can attach fairly flexible types of data and information into their transactions and access them as you please  I m not far enough yet in my Solana experience to comment on whether these features are more or less convenient in Solana  Cardano has a lot of SDK s in the works though  They plan to support every language  I m judging their Plutus platform which is admittedly very rough and contains a lot of boiler plate and inconvenient code but you can see the potential once it gets cleaned up  The main reason I didn t just stick with Cardano is the type of dapps I want to make will not be feasible for high 20 cent plus  network fees that I don t see getting better for years Decentralization  Cardano is from my perspective more decentralized there s arguments against this   Right now validation is community handled IOHK does not officially operate any nodes   By technical definition Solana is considered centralized still because slashing is not automated but the infrastructure is there for it to make the technical push to being  Decentralized  whenever slashing has been decided on  People argue that Solana validators have a high barrier to entry because of hardware costs  I disagree with that take  You are not going to get people pledging to your pool unless you pledge a substantial sum on any POS chain  Hardware requirements in that case don t make much difference  What it does enable is for people to use cloud services instead of their own computers on Cardano  I m not sure that validators using centralized cloud services to perform network operations makes things more decentralized than heavy hardware  Cardano also has a saturation mechanic where stake pools give you less rewards if too many people stake in that pool  This feature does not amount to much as those pools just make more pools and get large network control anyways so we are at the same point  They both suffer a bit from top heavy staking  My tone on decentralization is a bit negative but you have to understand things will probably never be completely decentralized  this amount is enough in my opinion to properly sustain these networks down the line  Even Bitcoin has majority in China  the important thing is that the reward for destroying the network will never outweigh the cost  Cardano is very  very ambitious  and while they are slow  they do deliver  Their following gives them incredible presence that is starting to reach the public  Their work in Africa is beyond every other blockchain on the political side  They have a lot of credibility A lot of issues Cardano has put the effort in solving are in my opinion already solved in Solana just by Solana being fast  Cardano put extra effort to make cross token swaps and failing transactions not charge you  Solana s fees are so little and transactions so much faster that those aren t ever issues to begin with Conclusion  Solana is more practical  will still be useful in an Ethererum dominated world  Solana is FAST  Cardano still needs more time in my opinion for the technology to thrive  Ethererum is going to scale before them I m pretty sure  What they have done on the public perception and political side is un matchable and I can t wait to see what they look like down the line  Investing in Cardano is more like investing in a company than a blockchain for me Most people can t be bothered with using an hour of their time I guess  I wish more people did I think that it being competitive is good  it pushes all parties to do their best  But it doesn t need to be winner take all  both Solana and Ethereum can be thriving at the same time  That s something many people agree on The founder is highly credible like I mentioned and they re based out of thr bay area  so we ll see some big name backers Going to be interesting to see how they progress moving forward RIP Crypto Bear MarketMay 2021   May 2021 I would add that SOL has synchronous transactions whereas in the current ETH transactions can be rearranged and front run  which is absolutely bonkers and makes me angry that this crap is popular The AWS of blockchains would move some money   I hope the SOL marketing can leverage this buzz carefully without over promising Does that hold true with doge This was very useful  Thank you for your time  I hope SOL makes all of us rich Will watch  But it does not have to be a competition  The future of multchain imo I ve been trying for days but my SOL wallet address on CBP won t load   ‍ ️ He s butthurt about something else and just being a dick to you to make himself feel better Many of us are holding both projects  I am holding Solana for the present and future and I am holding ADA for the future   Advantage SOL   I hope the both become the best two smart contract planform of the near future  I got in both ADA and SOL early into the project  probably because of that I feel a personal attachment for this two project  I am not faithful to any other projects beside this two and unfortunately I keep pouring money on weekly bases to both on Paper Solana is the Best blockchain  as far as Transaction fees and speed  As for ADA the community will play a huge role one institution start announcing the investing into the project  also Hydra could be the real difference if they deliver  regardless I will be very wealthy That s what I told them  and they said proof of stake was not what made it faster  but loads of unrelated upgrades  However these upgrades are only even possible with PoS  Just another case of misinformation being spread for the sake of securing market price Marketing if done properly directly translates into growth  The ecosystem is likely to grow at not only a larger but faster rate if Solana had comprehensive marketing  They re inextricably linked my friend https   solflare com   https   solflare com   has a contact form at the bottom of the page  Don t count on them being able to help you though  although I do hope this gets solved  Just being realistic Do you have any guess how they could have gotten your credentials Looks like you guys need to see Cardano and it s white papers and academic peer reviews   I think Cardano with Charles hoskinson is taking a long approach to develop the marketing and user friendly to reach as many people as soon as possible in a economy ready for decentralized banking You want a simple explanation  Cardano was released in 2015  has proven many time it s safe and reliable  has clearly been one of the most advanced coin at the time   And you compare it to something launched one year ago     Also  I like Solana project a lot  but there is a terrible lack of information  at least reviewed by expert  Cardano market was also weak  but it managed to reach a good position  Give time to Solana project  and if everything is as good as advertised  it should reach the top too  But saying  iT ShOulD BE At LeAsT aS HiGh aS CarDaNo  is just showing how little you digged about this topic My simpleton view Solana  already working  very fast and very cheap  Cardano  might be working in the future  Great potential I hold both  but i am an active user of several of the apps on Solana Hey  I saw this post and decided to follow you because of it  P  Awesome right up mate  I sent it to my buddies who needed to know what Solana was haha This should be on solana s 1 pager marketing brochure Sol better in every way makes ada irrelevant Lmoa  Haha   ASS  I guess that would be the next biggest thing A very good episode  why this video doesn t get more upvote in this sub is beyond me It is not just the UI  There are more ada pools and distribution of staked coins is better  because of the saturation point  So cardano is way more decentralized than solana right  Correct me if i am wrong Sure someone is going to come in and day SOL has actual smart contracts and ADA does not  But I d also like a legit breakdown and  comparison  I ll also be doing more research on it on my own biu Before the crash occurred  I was expecting SOL to hit around  350AUD by end of 2021 I will still stick to that figure That is just my humble opinion Even I d like to hear an answer to this  as I hold both of them too Interesting  thanks Marketing is just a really broad term The way you are describing it I completely agree that there is some positive stuff to be done in terms of reaching broader crowds and user friendliness etc I m against the pump price schilling aspect  I want the moon boi s as far away as possible  the way they increase exposure is a net negative in my eyes I m not here to shill Harmony even though it s great just like Solana  Just giving trade tips for  SOL buying I mean I dont completely disagree  Good marketing would also attract developers  But eventually for people to use their dapps and get to know them good marketting is essential  One example is Binance exchange vs FTX  FTX is a much better exchange which doesnt go down during market crashes and has a host of innovative products that binance copies and a better and easier to use interface  But because of lack of marketing and shilling it doesn t get as much recognition  So even though you may have a good product most people dont have the time to find out that you have the best product  They just use the thing other s use  Will this eventually change  probably  But with marketing it would change faster You re welcome  glad to help   I want people to be able to use these tools on their own to make the best staking decisions for themselves Great read friend thanks Not only that but it seems like many of the founders speak an alien language  Just listen to the interviews with the founders like Vitalik Ethereum  or even Antoly Solana  it s like they re on a different plane of existence  It s all very technical and everything just goes over your head They came back  How d you manage to get them back Right  I see what you mean I have PTSD from the Harmony subreddit  I m a bit out of touch with that being understandable kind of stuff  I m so into blockchain I forgot people don t even understand Bitcoin still  back to my cave then I second this     Solana is more than a legit coin  but I would love to be able to hold this in my trezor Thanks for taking time to answer this I dont agree  good marketing would also help with Solana s growth and faster adoption  Look at Ethereum s webpage they have wonderful easy to understand explanations AND a good blockchain Thanks for the info mate By the way  you can directly use

Python modules  just by doing HTTP POST queries good points Look at the price It will start gradually increasing with constant steam for 2 3 days before Looking at how SOL is not moving right now compared to all the other currently hit cryptos  I would say it won t be listed for at least a week  probably two Solana is fine  it s some of the apps that are buggy since they re all so brand new Matic is erc20 I plan on holding Bitcoin for years  Guess I should prob just buy conventional to avoid any potential risks It is getting higher currently Yep has been for a while You are wrong  chart is as important as fundamentals  If a project didn t perform well in a strong bull market that we had there is a low chance that it will perform well in short and mid term Another reason that chart is as important as fundamentals is market is literally full of thousands of different coins and projects need strong marketing to be seen  get traction and go up otherwise market will forget them and the best way to detect this is based on chart True  but thats really just UI  Much easier to fix than the actual chain Im personally buying 80  sol staking on Sol Flare  and then 10  ray and 10  serum and staking some ray on Raydium and and have some srm ray in the liquidity pool  Still looking for a place to stake my serum thats not in the LP  Ray and Srm seem good for an LP pair to me since they are symbiotic and should rise and fall at the same time but I am still too worried about impermanent loss to put all of it in the LP  I plan on trying to stake some ICOs with Ray on Raydium too Solana right now is lil bit buggy but devs are working on the broken code  once it s ready it ll have the ability to support billions of ppl transacting everyday  so with that on mind always do a small test transaction and never ever give or enter your seed words or private key in any place  public keys are fine You can say that a higher price   more successful blockchain   more developers users due to generated interest in the project but nothing really This is the way   or  the way this is 100  safe  nothing in life is      martinez661      Commands   opt out    delete Nothing in life is 100  safe I mostly agree  but the average Joe doesn t need to understand the tech or anything really  When we get there  the average Joe will be on the blockchain without really knowing it  Solana is still laying down the tracks IMO and attracting developers to create cool shit and join the ecosystem and in 2 3 years that infrastructure and ecosystem will be ready for average Joe and he won t know what hit him What about atom instead of dot or ergo instead of link Sorry for your loss Did you turn on auto transactions Did you give an impersonating  support mod admin  your seed phrase You re gonna lose a lot of money if you dont start learning and verifying things  Transactions are final  It s not VISA or American Express APR is the right hand column of  s Wow   Without a doubt the most in depth and  real  reply I ve had to a one word question on Reddit  ever Thanks for sharing your knowledge that stinks  i stake on solflare but thru my ledger   i would recommend using one next time If I understand you correctly sharding improves throughput  through parallel blocks    but does not improve latency on its own And are there any risks to sharding  I would imagine shards are harder to coordinate and easier to attack Yes  makes sense  Seems like Solana has really pushed the boundaries for proof of stake  Too many people have not realized this yet   but even I lack the in depth knowledge to put it all together on the spot Maybe use Trust Wallet if you re planning to just hold it or Sollet if you want to interact with the chain  dexes  swap  etc True  And in my opinion  same reason that Elon Musk is sometimes giving the cryptoverse heartaches when he is tweeting  To me  he is saying he likes doge coins because it sort of reaches the masses a bit more even if it sorely lacks technical advantages I must say that  cardano s stake system way better than solana Thank you   Funds came back Actaully it s like BTC   typewriter ETH   smartphone Solana   talking Japanese toiletI joke  Yes to your Analogy  in a weird way soo my 3 years old self understood this as Other Blockchains    brick and motar storesSolana    Ebay It will be ok  The terms technology can be confusing sometimes  Just give it some time and the coins should be returned There is a fundamental limit   Proof of Work cannot emit blocks too quickly or they will suffer from an exponential and unsustainable number of forks   Proof of Stake can avoid that through the cooperative mechanism of leader schedules  and the Proof of History mechanism can then be used  as it is in Solana  to quickly eliminate the possibility of most forks without slow and complex message passing bless you sweet one Step was heavily shorted on FTX especially with the farmed tokens  Traders had a field day shorting it from ATH to the ground That makes sense  Sort of  You make sense  The website description is a bit misleading K so I read the thread and it seems you re looking at an erc20 token but it says  Solana SOL Futures  xSOL  ERC20  and that is not the same as the SOL   That is a token pegged to SOL per se   But it is not SOL  It has its own blockchain   Trezor should clarify this Solana solve alot of problems without all these stuff L1 L2 etc   Its leading in terms of performance for sure  Am not saying ETH is bad  It is a big boy coin since they are the first few project that allows smart contracts but that s about it I sent some XRP to Exodus and then swapped for Solana  Looking to transfer that somewhere now  But thanks for the info  I haven t dove to far into Harmony but I ve been seeing it making moves and looks attractive I think people just see  1 50 and think they re early on the next ETH that ll hit  4000  Not realizing market cap makes it the 3rd biggest and it s not like getting ETH at 1 50 at all I totally agree with you  In the current era  a subpar project with awesome marketing will seem to lead first while an awesome project with not much marketing may lose out first   But with proper marketing  we can identify which is good and which is not Solana is worth Ethereum level  Cardano has alot marketers  50 KOLs if not wrong  and they shill alot even without much progress after so many years  I prefer action takers  Am a marketer myself hence I can differentiate between quality projects vs marketed projects that are of low quality Yes it does  marketing leads to awareness which leads to interest then research which leads to use and adoption which results directly in a higher demand i e  a higher coin value  I agree with many people on this thread that say there needs to be a bigger voice that leads solana unapologetically to adoption  If the owners of Solana aren t up for it I would get someone to kick off something at least to get Solana as a topic onto the proverbial kitchen table This was a good conversation  good back and forth and the moderator asks thoughtful questions https   www reddit com r TREZOR comments mntmdz very_disappointed_is_trezor_just_a_scam This was what I saw   Notice how they have erc20 next to Solana https   trezor io coins the link Is what also Chainlink  ERC20 token  Matic Polygon  Polygon  MATIC  is an Ethereum token that powers the Polygon Network is  this  https   solana com wormhole  akin to what you were reading Harmony One is great On Trezor  it said that SOL was supported as an erc20 token   When I converted all my other tokens to the ledger on Trezor from MetaMask  they were also ERC20 tokens  and transferred in on the Ethereum network So  I guess I m confused about which tokens are actual networks   vs tokens   For example ChainLink or Matic vs Solana I can t even explain this stuff to my nerdy friends and I ve been into tech for 20 years Pretty much the same thing applies to UI UX across most of the crypto space  Gotta realize most of the people starting up projects are developers and engineers  They can build solid code  but don t focus too much on user experience  interactions  and marketing  It s also kind of understandable  Why market a tool that s usable  but not complete  Speculators want the token price to rise as rapidly as possible  but marketing a product that s not ready for mainstream adoption  and having it crumble under the pressure can only do more harm than good  There s gotta be a balance  where teams make the product work first   speculators are free to get in at the ground floor  but the expectation should not be lambos raining from the sky right out of the gate  UX  amp  marketing need to be considered  but in due time I am definitely an investor  and interested in the long term  but I am new and I am learning  Also I am older  and this technology is not user friendly Correct  I just want them to be a bit more active in informing us on what is going on  For example  we should not be guessing why is SOL not on Coinbase  Tech problems  of what  SOL Owners should know and explain why delay  we should not be guessing   it creates FUDDDDD What made you think Solana and it s ecosystem existed on the Ethereum network No 0 06 is the   change in one epoch  i e  3 days   Actually it s rounded  the actual value is 0 0005566234 The APR is how much you d make in a full year at that rate   It s 6 41  for epoch 184  a particularly bad epoch  it was bad for everyone since it was an unusually long epoch  APY would be a bit more than that because APY includes compounding interest  which APR does not   APY is more accurate because if you don t do anything  your stake rewards go into your stake and then compound  so APY represents what you will actually end up with after 1 year According to stakeview app  which accurately calculates these things using the same source of data as the command line tool  the APY for epoch 184 for Everstake was 6 62 They don t even really think the everyday people need to understand it in the beginning  as long as developers are building apps that people can use they will invest in it  I m sure most of the crypto you buy you use  I do   any dex I like I have I buy the coin to use the dex  even if I don t quite understand the different layers That s because more people know him as a co founder to ETH and they don t know the founders of Solana as much  I mean SBF is on CNBC sometime but is he a co founder of Solana or just a co founder of SRM I know it doesn t directly answer the question  but there s a reason eth 2 0 is moving to PoS I think that s a naive take   ETH 2 0 still won t be able to handle transactions half as cheaply as polygon can  Plus  I think as the web 3 develops  there will be new  memory intensive demands that solutions like polygon will be able to support True True This claim needs some serious foundation  Let s hear it Maybe there is a way to make use of the work that is then used as a proof but otherwise PoW will just always have to perform more computations than proof of stake  which will take time yes exactly but my point is  maybe im wrong idk  there theoretically could be a faster pow chain that could out compete some current pos chain  for all intents and purposes pos seems to be a better blockchain solution for throughput than pow How many of them actually work Kin for sure  it s integrated on to a few very descent apps   There is speculation that it is going to be integrated on to Whisper app soon as well if you re choosing between serum and raydium based on the chart performance  then you shouldn t be investing imo  learn about the projects before you look at the chart there are several medium posts about the serum swap pools being deprecated and why it was  good for both raydium and serum  google is free Right  and consensus is required for the network to process transactions on a common fork  The longer consensus takes  the slower transactions are confirmed Reported  Mods please take this down Anatoly is on in Twitter a lot  So the others  YouTube channel always has some lives talking about projects  They are doing stuff  The problem is just marketing Check out KIN It s not necessarily faster it s a conensus mechanism  Eth 1 0 is proof of work  amp  is faster than btc s proof of work  Solana s proof of stake is faster than stellar s  Like with most things  it depends Stellar who Everybody there who says this  project  is good has less than 1 karma    just be careful guys I like both But actual ETH 2 0 in all it s glory is not around the corner  Matic will grow during that time and be far from useless  It will be years before ETH wouldn t need solutions like Matic Omg  Sorry not to be kind to you  But you don t even read carefully to invest  Only mooning is what you care I guess  Anyway  The trans would be failed and funded back to your account  Don t worry  But it takes time Thank you for the guidance Petition to get people to stop spamming  when price go up Amen If  I recall correctly it takes one epoch for stake to activate  I think one Solana epoch is 2 3 days  You can either check then or try a beach explorer like  https   solanabeach io   https   solanabeach io   and check your stake account  Hope this helps Cardano is quite frankly trash compared to Solana  I wouldnt worry too much about this I bought  250 worth and I m at  360 rn but I m gonna hold for a while hint   hint    the AAVE Github has Solana in it     Also  AAVE is going cross chain that is confirmed  so    just a waiting game to see where they also land on  My bet is on Solana for now Well executed product examples would be   odysee com  https   odysee com    capsule

mature from thee I was also looking for a wallet to stake Solana  Reading the documentation  Solana   they are the ones who recommend SolFlare to you  So I followed their advice  creating an account is very simple but to log in you will always have at hand the Keystore file which is as if it were the password of your account   Personally I m finding myself well and I recommend it  as a validator I also recommend  melea xyz   Staking P  L FREE Validati n service all 2021  which for 2021 has 0 fees and for 2022 less and less than the others I ve been right all year and yes I m retarded They re not waiting on liquidity until they announce they re accepting deposits again Got my first 45 yesterday 1 Sol   1 fitty milli FTX Pro gives you 10  Apy  paid hourly  Message me if yiu want a referal They are incomparable I made  This Spreadsheet  https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1vpBQI2DFUk7zXS4TCs9ZOnatvWHiYf5jHjKgKpfJG5Y edit  to compare interest rates on a bunch of coins across several exchanges  but some of the exchanges offer staking  A couple of them have really great rates on SOL A lot of drinks Must hurt to be that dumb I like this Ledger com Yess u need to keep seed phrase for all wallets  hot or cold Seed phrase for cold storage  I have plenty of seed phrases for my other wallets Didn t know you could stake in Sollet Who cares Try simpleswap io hi what apps that you currently using Hi buying in soon  I m dad thanks  I m buying in soon This is the way I think liquidity probably means building a reserve for their margin trading operation  That s takes some serious coin  but of course now is the time for them to buy Seems like they re involves with compound finance  Definitely gonna follow up with this thanks Yes it works flawlessly Why isn t if be on coinbase pro yet  It was suppose to be on there last week Here s another actuallyhttps   twitter com fluiditymoney Fuck yes    Get some Can you use moonlet with a ledger OP is lying fraud BTWSo is Melker but so is OP 4 days and still not unstaked in Exodus Wallet  shows 0 balance Guys a clown  never seen him shill Sol thoProbably cause he hasn t Looks interesting thanks I think it s better to hold off the debut until it rebounds til around  45 50   No clue why it s delayed besides the prior coinbase blog post letting us know it s delayed but might be a blessing in disguise Check this out  looks interestinghttps   twitter com SoteriaCurrency They say they re waiting on liquidity    yet I m unable to send my SOL to my CBpro wallet   ‍ ️ That s not happening on other exchanges   It s a Coinbase issue  not a Solana issue I don t think it s on Sol end  it s on coinbase end  so basically a waiting game Good choice I have bought mine 139 at 28  and 100 at 16  Solana it seams to be great tech  investment although some reason Eth making a trend  it s look like If Eth is going down all altcoins does as well wonder why hmm solana got own ecosystem isn t it But for Solana Exodus always shows  0 SOL available  and Claim rewards button is disabled  I assume it s because it only allows claiming 1 SOL minimum  So I have to wait until I get at least 1 Sol before I can claim  no oh cool thanks  i didnt realize there was a simpler page for monitoring epoch progress   thank you It s moved down a ton since you asked this question  which is typical of such high starts peaks for an LP  amp  x200B You can expect a high yield for a short time to fall off and either crash and burn or stabilize  We are waiting to see which STEP is going to do but I am holding and making a few bucks a day at a very low investment point I m seeing the same thing  stuck at 43   This pages says 57 3  right nowhttps   explorer solana com Waiting as well  I wanted to swap over a bunch of my holding I had on coinbase during the dip and now looks like I missed out on the sale Moonlet all the way  11  apy super easy to use You can use a vpn   Just use your email and google authenticate  instead of your phone number  for 2FA   But before you do anything make sure you can move coins off of whatever site you choose without having to do kyc   Some sites require kyc to make withdrawals and you don t want to keep your coins on a site that you can move it off of now because they might change policies or whatever Its 2021 and they both are far from being complete  Invest in both and see where they go in YEARS  Anyone saying one is better than the other is a time traveler cause we are investing in the future  Also based on history  what s the  best  does not mean it s the one to survive and succeed  Diversity is your friend Wondering the same  I can t even deposit any on CB Pro  If I try to get the wallet address  it just spins forever  Desktop or app  doesn t matter  Been like that for days We need Michael Douglas  as Gordon Gekko  to stare  in the dark  quiet room  evening  at the 100 inch SOL Screen with all projects on it  for 10 seconds  without saying anything Then make a quick phone call to his guy    and says   Buy SOL now  do your job  I should ve know about this one already   15 seconds commercial  Then tomorrow  in reality  price of SOL goes to  70  I bet this would be the case  Which one is your favorite Ill look into it for sure U need to keep multiple copies of ur seed phrase anyways as good practice and then u are fine   Those that are prepared are ones that win in the long run lol tb12 getting in on the action https   github com certusone wormhole  https   github com certusone wormhole  and  https   solana com wormhole  https   solana com wormhole  are the only sources of information I can find on this Coinbase is building its exchange and using the tech from these companies   NDA For context  SBF is the founder of FTX  amp  Serum  A major face for Solana  Serum is built on Solana  Again for new people that are still learning Welcome SOLdiers I could be wrong about this  but I heard that if you stake on Exodus  it is all being staked to a single validator and therefore not really good for the network   I stake over on SolFlare and I get to choose my validators and spread my Sol around   Currently I have 200 sol staked in 20  10 Sol lots to 20 different validators Exodus is where I stake  I convert my BAT to SOL on Uphold but they dont allow SOL withdrawls  so I convert to XRP  transfer to Exodus then exchange to SOL  this is an expensive process but works Where are you staking  I m waiting on this damn Uphold  cool off  to end so I can transfer to cold storage or stake   Raydium seems a bit sketchy from a bit of reading thats a trash brokerage Did you not know that you couldn t withdraw certain cryptos from certain exchanges   For example you cannot withdraw SOL from Uphold   Now you are pretty smug in thinking that you were all knowing on the subject   you come off as arrogant and dumb  but I wouldn t call you retarded You guys know what the max price is or realistic one is for 3 years maybe thanks Or just use FTX Everyone buy the top  s I check every night when I get home from work  been wanting Solana but it is honestly the hardest coin Ive ever tried to buy   I live in NYC  Looking forward to just getting it on cbpro 2 epoch   4 days did you honestly just ask if you can withdraw from an exchange you sir  are retarded Exodus  https   support exodus com article 1551 solana staking faq  wallet Wow congratulations Twitter has notifications Where can you stake  Seems FTX us doesn t allow it cheers for constructive reply   asking because only been around a month or so  in trading but I did my research around solana  before investing it seams that it has an solid ground with all ecosystem around it self and consider is fairly new  in my opinion there is a lot of peoples with negative thoughts about cryptocurrency   too many kids which want to be millionaires by investing money in meme coins instead research  and look into mid long investments and of course ending as paper hands they are You can t stake on their site  There are numerous options and there are several posts here about to check out  I d suggest reading up on it cuz there are several options and several considerations Same     Hopefully they ll give us an update soon It says I can t stake Sol on here     Is it only me I m sorry but unless you re a day trader I feel that level of awareness is unnecessary and potentially damaging to your mental health  Maybe time to unplug What s the APR on solflare Seriously what s your opinion on it  The info on CMC looks good  It isn t a hype or meme coin  It s already been as high as  2 98 but ya know   Crash  The beginner  novice  or meme trader probably has no idea how to trade this  I can t find too much on it  since it s an SPL token I thought this might be a good place  It s just hard to objectively assess potential with such a lack of information Yes please avoid Binance  It s an absolutely garbage exchange now  FTX all day Now it s on my radar Hmm I have Sol in my wallet but no staking option anywhere  I messaged customer service and they replied with this  FTX US doesn t offer staking  More info on margin here    https   help ftx us hc en us articles 360046850054 Margin Trading I bought in binance us  but you can also exchange in exodus  Soon you ll be able to buy in Coinbase pro Coinex is my go to for SOL  but FTX us has 10x the volume Yeah solanabeach io seems to sometimes have data capture issues   It appears to have not updated its epoch completion bar in some time   Right now it still says 43   here is the actual       solana epoch info        Block height

really excited for them to get to that next stage Congrats you re now a millionaire lol European  But     Solana is universal  We are all one Ftx us is the best place to get sol if your in the US Exactly  I do not think so It s not the end of the bull run  Look up Plan B s S2FX model  Next  account for the amount of global money printing that didn t exist in 2017  aka inflation   The model suggests the cycle is about half way but I would argue unprecedented inflation adds a multiplier effect I think we see a  500 SOL minimum this cycle but likely higher as laggards realize there s no use in building atop the current popular chains  Unfortunately  there s still a ton of emotionally bias driven narratives that have yet to fade   New blood  won t have the same level of bias Only CB can tell Not sure what you re referring to with BTC but big money will absolutely dominate the crypto market until there is 10 trillion or so float and or there is a utility driven liquidity asset  Expect retail to continuously get rinsed until its common place for your financial advisor to offer crypto advice products  Very annoying and sad state of affairs but immensely profitable if you can control emotion and simply hold as the market matures Pretty sure he s referring to the unlabeled token  Which admittedly  is an annoying trait with Solana and these recent airdrops  I would assume it s an easy fix though any rumblings of when it might be added   Want to get in on SOL  but not wanting to setup yet another exchange just to get it  esp when it should be available on CB Pro soon Here come institutions again trying to play the Bitcoin and the whole market  They got BTC Dollar pair marked for whatever point they like to suck retail money    The market has totally changed  Abandon Bitcoin for the market indicator Mandala Exchange is the way  Binance but cheaper and not cucked Coinbase soon my friend It is currently  They re in like stage 0 or something I think they called it  In the near future theyll go to stage 1 and implement on Solana I m a little confused    the faq on their website says it s an ERC 20 token Just buy it on Binance US or Ftx US and move to a ledger and stake on Solflare imo  They aren t gonna release it on CB until its at least  40 unless you actually believe the technical issues excuse Please edit your OP title with something that people will understand  amp  may help you in return What s your question again What happened to the press release that it was being listed on Coinbase Pro May 24th  It s still not there Solana Already had a face but you don t know it yetTrevor Lawrance   1st Pick Overall yet TB12 is the GOAT With the current inflation rate 10  if the economy slow down with just 1  it would mean an increase of 1  inflation  Most of the people will not understand      Overall the economy of the world has it peaks and lows  In the following years we will have a rise of the economy  it maybe months  until the cycle is completed and after that there s a slow down and this is the moment where the inflation will start creeping up  In this way of thinking we must have CONSTANTLY rising economy growth to prevent rising of the inflation  because the government can t stop printing money  However the point is that soon or later the price of bitcoin could be really 500 000   but you can buy not a Lamborghini  but only a computer or the new iPhone 21 for example  In this way of thinking Solana fair price is 2726 37  which will give 10 Trillion dollars marcet cap  Which will give price of 300k  per BTC    life is good  fuck now  live now and drink now  because you will have to pay 1 BTC for beer   tomorrow Appreciate this  Love Coin Bureau too thanks This Coin Bureau video explains when you ll likely see SOL listed  basically after the market recovershttps   www youtube com watch v ltcnTTeDFjY Pretty sure it s sarcasm  Lol One day in the distant future when Uphold finally approves me I will be able to pull out my BAT from brave I came here to post that I 100  agree that binance us is ass   This is my peace It runs off of ftx     like I said  ftx with extra steps And I m all for  FTX us  https   FTX us   as others have mentioned   I ll look into Blockfilio    just what I need  another exchange to deal with good price  258 is      Affectionate Type 89      Commands   opt out    delete 272  is good price Just came across this tweet  thought back to this convo https   twitter com trungtphan status 1397927119116660741 s 21 What financial information are you asking about  I got a lot of my information from coin bureau and Solana s website I d go with blockfolio then which I believe is just ftx with extra steps lol I enjoy it because of the free crypto lol Uphold has SOL  but at the moment you can t move it out into a wallet  Same with Bithumb Global  you can buy it  but you can t move it Stop looking at your SOL chart do shit and buy amc  from one anon to another How did you access all this financial information Solana is easy top 5 crypto  I don t think this will be the end of bull run  There are still a lot of people that don t know how good Solana is  If you re in it for long run and believe in the project  just hodl and the price will follow Where did you hear that  Could you please give us the source  Thanks Yeah it s the end  Come back when it begins again Use atomic wallet CoinGecko  do your own search there Blockfolio or Uphold both have SOL available  unless youre in NY i think Where is the news Kraken has Solana Anyone here from NY been able to buy Sol  Its not on Atomic wallet or Kucoin where I usually do my swaps for coins not available on coinbase pro  Any ideas or info would be greatly appreciated Also congrats on the new coins 1000 or bust I m inexperienced with Raydium  apologies Hey Im also in NY and trying to buy Sol  Were you able to find a method that works Yea in the same boat as you  First head about it in February but didn t look to much into it but I love the tech and proof of history is super interesting  I ll be buying the dips as well Updated link  https   futureoverload com solana fundamental analysis if we re talking efficiency  solanas on top of the list for sure  I used to bat an eye when I found out about it  which wasn t too long ago  but when I looked into the project it just clicked for me  I took advantage of this dip and bought a nice amount  It s my favorite crypto so far  and oh  projects been around for what    a year  thats nothing  ROI in 3 5 years is going to be massive  plus really looking forward for some upcoming projects on the solana network  like star atlas  yeaaaa Noob question here  how to UNstake Raydium  or does it do it automatically after some time  Thanks Link didn t work 30 40 50 65 80 92 120 168 178 196 228 up and down and double I use coinbase transfer over to exodus wallet then use VPN to exchange You have staking  farms  pools  swap on Raydium  Orca Tomorrow Because  I am staking there as we speak Yes  under Wallet go to the token you wish to withdraw and the option is on the right to deposit  withdraw  convert are you sure  i just don t see it on their website indicating that To a solana wallet  yes  You could also withdraw sol to a wallet exchange that supports it Blockfolio FTX US  https   ftx us  gclid

will be cheapest  Second route is stealthex io or other no kyc needed swap websites  This will incur a bigger fee then an exchange but not that bad Third route is connect metamask will sollet wallet and convert eth to Sol directly  This option is the most expensive and the max that can be swapped is  1 eth at a time Yes Yo brotha  from NY aswell  Vpn and account with ftx will be cheapest  Can send you a referral link if you d like  Second route is stealthex io or other no kyc needed swap websites  This will incur a bigger fee then an exchange but not that bad Third route is connect metamask will sollet wallet and convert eth to Sol directly  This option is the most expensive but also the most convenient can you withdraw them from  FTX US  https   FTX US Haha  The wormhole is essentially a bridge between the Ethereum ecosystem  and any all EVM compatible ecosystems  such as Binance Smart Chain  and Solana  Most liquidity and assets are housed in Ethereum  and EVM compatible  ecosystems  namely all ERC 20 tokens So by creating a way for these assets to bridge into Solana  it seems like a major demand catalyst for the underlying SOL token  and the SPL token standard   I am hoping to find as much info as I can on what this roadmap looks like and timelines  To your point  yes it would create a major avenue for more corporate adoption by being EVM compatible Go to Step Finance  open Liquidity pools section  look APY I keep wondering the same     From what I can tell avoid Binance and Uphold  I m moving to FTX or Kraken today Come on  Why not kraken I see I don t use binance but that s sounds decentTend to use ftx FTX US is the way Yes  but there was no SOL EUR pair  forcing people to make exchanges and suffering fees and exchange rates for it Now once it a added if they use Euro  they can just directly buy Solana that way
2021-05-28,33.67552514,34.50250599,28.06714391,Dont forget that Hapi is led by a top former hacker himself who won multiple awards at hackaton s  His experience separates this project by far from every other security protocol used in crypto so far  Hapi security protocol INTERCEPTS hacks by way of live monitoring and much more important advanced machine learning  And even if a hack did take place it slows the act of siphoning out funds by sharing the hackers  wallets  characteristics and sending them straight through the oracle to all other exchanges platforms blockchains  As soon as the funds are sent there they are blocked  As one of the Hapi Team members said in the recent AMA they will flaunt their intercepted hacks well when their protocol in place and running  June will be a VERY big month for Hapi  Testnet release  bridge release  already finished  making Hapi crosschain and ethereum   binance smart chain compatible  extra staking pool for hapi holders  new website listing all partners and VC investors and still in the middle of the process with a top5 exchange to finish paperwork and get listed  most believe it to be Kucoin With a market cap of 14mil and max supply of 1mil   continuous token burning taking place it s an absolute GEM investment to buy this early  9wks old   sit on your big bag and in 2025 when it hit EASILY 10bn market cap it s price a hapi is above 10k dollars  And 10bn market cap for such a use case is  especially by then  EASY and still fairly low conservative estimation Hapi is by far the most underrated project in crypto  second to non blockchain cybersecurity system 3 usd by late 2022 Huge collab right there  Solana is the new BSC for projects to launch on  i expect massive gains for  HAPI Hapi is a very good investment Why is binance us shit  I am not american so I using regular binace and it works very well  I can only compare to conbase pro wchich is an abomination Still early too  I m so excited that I found this Sad LMAO          https   www youtube com watch v 20UGtbI_q5w lol Any way to recover Usdc should be erc20 It was cheap but good lesson Not much   10  only I have for you bad news  How much you lost Bye bye defi hackers on thw way Huge news for HAPI just a start up only few months old Selsun blue is the real shit Great partnership  they both created what is potentially goin to be The most Advanced Launchpad in history  Go check out by urselves guys and DYOR about HAPI Protocol HAPI   SOL   MOON Sounds a bit US biased Bocachica owned by hapi and built in collaboration with solana https   solana com ecosystem bocachica This is gonna be Amazing Every token launched will be protected by  HAPI    HUGE This is a huge collaboration   great to see how Solana takes it s security seriously I ve been told to leave FTX immediately is it safe for crypto but not tokenized stocks That s a common thing if you re on the test dev network    Just people testing airdrops  etcIf you re on the main net  then I don t know   Try to flip it for a lamboOn the latter  there should be a default behavior to hide these as consumers speculators are pouring in after the Coinbase stuff My guess is they may be having trouble with the cross chain conversion and bridging   possible that people deposited SPL SOL and lost it because they re hosting wallets primarily for ERC20 tokens  e g  even MATIC is ERC20 MATIC not native MATIC 2500 USD per SOL Lack of liquidity  People buy and don t sell in the community and the initial investor whales are not selling even though they are 2700  up or more Just look out for a double head and shoulders followed by a selsun blue and a pert plus Honestly it holds just as much weight as saying  Wyckoff distribution    maybe more Serum Raydium  amp  Bonfida gt Sam and Mark have been quarreling with their tiny dicks and curly hairBrief swordfight Losing less does not equate to more profitable That s highly inappropriate and I m writing it down Sam and Mark have been quarreling with their tiny dicks and curly hair What dapp are you using I get your gripe about the  crypto investors  out there just wanting stuff to pump  but I believe that Solana needs better marketing to attract more devs  At the end of the day if Solana isn t utilized by developers  adoption will never happen  Obviously the marketing should be directed at the right people  but there still needs to be more Good news   My app says will be ready to trade in 5 hours For staking I would use solflare  If you are interested in LP and yield farming  I would look into raydium I think the official Solana website lists all current projects Every big coin listing on Coinbase has a dramatic increase  Even if it s just a pump and dump the first day  the fact of the matter is that a Coinbase listing gets coins on average a 30  pump even if it only last an hour can i borrow some money from ya Yes lol Am I on crypto Island and I have to vote one off Unless you live in NY I hope you posted this in the Altcoins  crypto  and Dot subreddits as well if you want a serious non bias opinion Get ftx us There s always binanceUS Your mom says I have one more leg down But if you had to choose one I think they both have a place in this space at this point We re in an accumulation phase  This was much needed  Don t be surprised if it dips a good amount again before it moves up  Then test the resistance and support levels  If there s enough support then expect it to start pumping GOT IT Sorry to hear that  I am living in Europe  so there is no issue with that for me Wouldn t say completely uncorrelated but I agree it was too high Stock price is pretty much uncorrelated  It was too high to begin with Sorry almost forgot  definitely take a look at solana website  lots of great stuff    Just my opinion Sol because it s faster and cheaper then dot Coinbase is trash  I honestly don t even think them listing coins is such a big deal anymore  Look at their stock since going public D Binance us Also I think every one waiting which way it s going to be  Solana is the ecosystem I ll put my trust on  all these analytics and market specialists did not warned about sudden crash so as it stand they know f all  to me  there is many  great ecosystems In place but I have put my stand in Solana  if I loose money so be it at least I have try not just bitching around Not even debating that Not enough people want to sell Wyckoff shows us to have 1 more leg down for the   spring F coinbase lol I wanted to get more SOL and kraken didn t have any tho    I didn t even realize because all the Sol I have now I had just swapped all my VET to SOL  So now I m sol shit outta luck  Can t believe they have ALGO n not SOL  Thought about just getting algo instead but I didn t Their bag isn t large enough  Coinbase has been trash for years  It is a VC dumping ground Yes I do  they are fuck bois You know you can activate a notification   of all their tweets right Buy  HODL  and forget about it  isn t doable if you can t buy I feel like they were afraid it was going to smash some competition they ve invested in That s what I saw  on Exodus  when I staked it  I don t think I had waited that long  more like 2 3 days  You can always refresh the blockchain to make sure   click the Solana logo  or the 3 dots at top right  the 4th option from the top      on a desktop computer  mobile might work differently Fake exactly 4 days like as soon as I hit stake or I agree  It took coinbase years and years of  clean track record  to qualify for a Nasdaq listing  They are ground breaking  They are sink or swim   If they lose new customer confidence they re screwed  and they just started  So if they make a listing  they are absolute insiders  and think theres a 50 50 chance of a tank  Wyckoff distribution   trap  etc  they have to be very mindful of it  Their future depends on it  cause now the market analysts will be looking for coinbase to grow quarter to quarter  then year to year  Blah blah blah  you get the point I got mine using litecoin and converting it on exodus wallet one epoch is 2 7 days  you will start recieiving one epoch later Dude who fucking cares  Take a break already  Worried about nothing  Solana is getting listed  What is with you weirdos flooding this thread  Are you constantly refreshing the Coinbase blog  Jesus  Solana is not DOGECOIN  Buy   HODL  and forget about it  This is not a MEME thread people They would have made that technical determination well in advance of announcing the CB pro listing  Imo the fact the market tanked at the same time the delay was announced is not a coincidence  It s shitty but we just have to be patient for now I don t think it has to do with price of Bitcoin  It could be that their recent engineering difficulties has made them unlikely to take on new coins  because maybe their engineering team is swamped right now fixing some of their known issues RemindMe  5 years I should have known you were a troll account   Back to your corner now No one will know cause coinbase is terrible with communication  Personally  I think they are waiting for bitcoin to get out of this consolidation purgatory   cause its either gonna go bull or its gonna tank like hell and bring the whole market down with it  There is a sense that we are in for one more deep dip  Thus  if coinbase feels we are in for another drop  they may not want to torpedo a new solid listing like solana  They may feel if new investors get in and the market tanks that will hurt their buyers confidence in the future  My thoughts you d be surprised   happens all the time  google it You need to wait for 4 days before starting to earn rewards 25 Million Are you waiting to sell the news or something   It s going to go down and sideways before it goes up is my guessCheck the price in 5 years instead I read somewhere that Coinbase is still having trouble cleanly connecting up to Solana s  network understood  I have done some research on my own  amp  most of the comments on this thread seem pretty fair  amp  accurate  I hold equal cardano  amp  solana  but it s hard to debate that solana is the better technology overall while cardano has the better brand history potential Lol thx I can t believe I missed this https   ropesolana com   https   ropesolana com   has white papers for Rope and the upcoming Ropev index It was on my radar because I saw the fusion pool on Raydium for it recently  and decentralized indexes are definitely an area I m trying to explore further  It sounds like it could open up a lot of new trading strategies once the index tokens come out  I bought a small amount to start farming  and I might buy more considering the FTX rumors lol  It actually does seem like exactly the kind of thing that FTX and Alameda would be interested in  the more I think about it ohhhhhhhhhhh sweet thanks Stake pools are coming  Hopefully incentives will be realigned  For now  we wait no defi tokens like burgerswap  ether  turtledex  only  btc and  etc are truly secure  if other protocols arent utilizing layer 1 security with  btc or  etc they doomed  so GL on your journey He s probably the one dumping right now gt  its all these defi and tokens that lack serious securityAre you talking about the token network that this sub is dedicated to btc  has no short comings  its all these defi and tokens that lack serious security  whales are buying and holding btc  so your sell theory only applies to the newbs  stop the fud dyor wit no cape Holding my twelve coins anyway Arbitrum  https   www reddit com r CryptoCurrency comments ne9dle arbitrum_is_the_best_smart_contract_platform   is making Solana irrelevant  and  Uniswap voted to adopt Arbitrum  https   www coindesk com uniswap vote deploy ethereum scaler arbitrum   not Solana Is there a difference in APY between those two strategies Yeah me too  I just worry people will ignore it You can undelegate at every new epoch  I ve change validators to a smaller one once I found out the about the halting power of top 16  Also Solana is still nascent technology  The market cap is only  14B there s still lots more to come into SOL and crypto in general SolFlare w  Ledger Nano Sure  many wealthy and powerful people do own btc  but     1  They re probably in profit right now  2  It costs them nothing to sell and walk away  assuming there s enough liquidity   3  Many are smart enough to eventually realize that btc has severe limitations that impact its long term value Okay  thank you  That ll become the bottleneck in the future for sure  P S  Also calculations for 1gbps network are not realistic since you d want your traffic in  out  seed some other servers  some free bandwidth to deal with basically any changes in the setup etc Yes that s the episode  aired just a couple days ago  Quite good  They talk about a lot of other chains which interoperate with exchanges so it s not as if you ll only hear about SOL  which is fine it s just that you ll be exposed to a lot of upcoming developments Don t forget  r iota if you are talking about zero fees Ayyyyyye     Welcome to a much more efficient future Been wanting to get in for a while   and I m here Just got in at  28  Hello everyone So low Valid points  The  system empowers existing validators  is not really that correct  Most goes to people who already have staked  so they can easily switch their validators and adapt to any centralization Still  staked stake is unlikely to be restaked for a long time and it is hard for new validators to gain traction  And the incentive to restake due to lower commissions may be outweighed by uncertainty about a validators reliability Good lord  Solana is doomed Yes I know  Still  a website is software and they might be doing who knows what in the background  Nobody knows because they are not open source The commission they take is only a percentage of rewards not all of it  So 10  commission of 11  rewards   Also it s only like 10k for the hardware to run a validator  The trouble is the continual cost and physical location of the supercomputer  Not to mention you likely have to offer 0  commissions for some time to garner stake from hodlers for a while before you can have enough  I don t think it s too unreasonable This is the first complaint I ve received regarding this if I get a few more I ll look to change the format of the website  Sorry it wasn t a good experience but appreciate the feedback Do you have black on white  I almost went blind trying to decipher what you wrote   white on black fonts  you kidding me  Shame as the start was interesting before I had to stop reading SolFlare is just a website  They don t control what happens on the sol blockchain or any of those addresses  It s just web response is slow  But I guarantee if you check the Solana explorer the transaction has went through in a lot less time The tokens are a fixed priced  If the pool dilutes you get less tokens and your remaining usdc left One small correction here  nano does not have inflation  Validators are not compensated Hero This is interesting  I didn t know this was an issue The amount should not matter I think  I sent just a minimal amount as a test and to confirm that Solflare was in fact slower than Sollet  The confirmation time can vary I guess but not by 18 seconds   I also guess its their software  But unfortunately Solflare doesn t seem to have open source   which I think is kind of risky Thanks  I found this write up very clean and useful when compared to ETH  I think we ll have to see how the proof of stake shakes out but if ETH doesn t overcome its staking problem in 10 months my liquidity is moving to one that solves that problem The network bandwidth is a helluva bottleneck  That s where the hard part is   not the validator machine specs I don t know if my reasoning is rational  but it definitely has to do with capital  Brian Armstrong didn t have enough invested  and listing Sol would send his competitor  our boy SBF  straight to the sun  Coinbase seems to be interested in pushing Chainlink IMHO Once it hits Coinbase is when it will really skyrocket How much SOL are you sending  I sent 100 SOL the other day and I noticed it took longer than say 10 SOL  That was on command line  I also use SolFlare and noticed that when I send SOL to that wallet it does take some time for the page to refresh  I think its just the UI  on the blockchain the transaction i guarantee is faster Yeah  nows the time to buy I think  Solana is being mentioned by finance people  Hopefully it gets adopted by the public in the next two years  That would be good for price  Youre still early There needed to be people putting down large amounts of money on something extremely uncertain at the very start of the Solana project for it to even have a chance  These people did that and now  and for a long time  other people have had the option to pile in and become a part of something big  Without the support at the beginning  there would be nothing  This is not a zero sum game  You can chose to whine about others being richer than you or start making a difference yourself Yes  Lyndon Rive  Left  Founder of SolarCity Two ether bulls break down 3 reasons why solana is an existential threat to ethereum in a  winner takes most  market where some of today s most popular crypto networks won t surviveKari McMahonethereum  A photo illustration of the digital Cryptocurrency  Ethereum  is seen on September 13 2018 in Hong Kong  Hong Kong  Yu Chun Christopher Wong S3studio Getty ImagesSolana is a new blockchain protocol that launched in March 2020 and has rose to prominence in recent months On a podcast  two ethereum bulls break down a thesis for why solana  SOL  could challenge ethereum They share their outlook for a multi chain future connected by networks like cosmos  ATOM  See more stories on Insider s business page In March 2020  blockchain protocol solana officially launched as an alternative for businesses and developers that want to launch decentralized products of massive scale  Since launching  the solana token  SOL  has become one of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and received backing from the likes of Sam Bankman Fried  29 year old crypto billionaire On the May 25 show of the Unchained podcast with journalist Laura Shin  two crypto experts  Kain Warwick and Kyle Samani  broke down their case for how solana could be a challenger to ethereum  What we re seeing now  especially with the high gas prices on ethereum  is that there appears to be a bit of an opportunity for chains like solana and Binance Smart Chain to really start chipping away at ETH dominance   said Warwick  on the podcast Warwick is the founder of the derivatives liquidity protocol Synthetix  and takes the technical approach  while Samani comes at it from an investment perspective from his role as managing partner at Multicoin Capital  I ll preface everything by saying that Multicoin is quite long ETH   Samani said on the podcast   We re more long ETH than Bitcoin  And we re even more long than that on SOL and Binance  Both Samani and Warwick are bullish on crypto and on ethereum s prospects  but they believe it s worth discussing the challenges of the network  I think that ETH community can t just be oblivious to this   Warwick said   This is actually happening  and we need to at least consider the momentum that these chains are getting  What exactly is solana The development of solana started in 2017  but the beta launch didn t happen until March last year  The goal is to provide a highly scalable  secure and maximally decentralized system without sacrificing throughput  a challenge that most competing blockchains face Solana really rose in prominence when Sam Bankman Fried committed to build his new decentralized exchange  Serum  on solana to compete with the likes of Uniswap Advantages of solana vs ethereum According to these ether bulls  on the podcast  what s solana got that ethereum doesn t 1  ScalabilityFor a long time  Samani has felt ethereum s approach to scaling has been insufficient  Scalability refers to a network s ability to handle a growing number of users and transactions  Solana s approach isn t perfect  but it s more advanced than ethereum  Samani said  The biggest challenge the ethereum ecosystem faces actually today  is that it is actually impossible to answer the question  what does a scaled ethereum application look like in 24 months   Samani said There s so many things interfering with one another on the ethereum network that to know the direction of the network and its potential scalability is difficult  Samani said  which makes it challenging for large companies to commit to ethereum because the long term direction is unknown 2  Developer capabilitiesSolana is built in Rust  which is a much more modern and a better programming language  according to Warwick The solana development framework is very distinct from ethereum s  which means everything needs to be built from scratch   Developers  are going to be able to take that code and develop it further   Warwick said   And it s just an ecosystem that s going to be much more competitive with ethereum  realistically  Solana s also learnt from the mistakes of previous networks making the environment very developer friendly  In terms of just like the core development environment  which is like it s based on the rust community   Samani said   And it seems like rust is going to slowly replace C   as like powering the guts of everything in the world  3  The ideology argument is becoming less relevantSolana is much more of an existential threat to ethereum because the average person doesn t care about the intricacies of decentralization  Warwick said Solana is more centralized than ethereum and bitcoin  which creates conflict among the crypto purists that vaunt the market s decentralization However  as more people join the community  including mainstream and large companies  this polarized ideology may fade  I think solana is a much larger threat to ethereum and is something that the ethereum community needs to be mindful of   Warwick  said    You can lose market share  Leaders fall behind all the time  especially in nascent phases of tech revolutions  right       We can t just hand wave it away and say  well solana is not a threat to ethereum and because of X  Y  or Z ideological view that we might have  I think it s really important  The future of blockchainsSamani s been surprised by ether s dominance over the last nine months  despite the proof of stake migration and monetary policy challenges  We were obviously dead wrong  ETH BTC has way outperformed expectations   Samani said   And so that s forced us to reconsider what the marginal buyers are caring about  Samani expected investors to attribute a higher value to bitcoin s potential to play a role as  digital gold   but has instead seen investors flock to cryptocurrencies that support real world use cases  such as ethereum s ether  based on an expectation that a growing number of users will employ them in the future  It just seems pretty logical to me that those dollars are going to migrate to where they see the 50 to a 100 million daily active users   Samani said   And I think the probability that that application ends up on Ethereum first  is actually much lower than the market kind of assigns  What about multi chain An argument could be made for a multi chain future  where multiple blockchain protocols exist and are connected by networks  such as cosmos  ATOM  and polkadot  DOT    I think that s wrong ish  It is obviously the right ish today  If you look at our portfolio  we have big THORchain position and a big solana position and a big ETH position   Samani said   Obviously  money says that we believe that s happening   But there is a cost with having multi chains from developer taxes to organization costs  such as gas fees and latency  So while short to medium  multi chain might work  Longer term  it could become less feasible  I think there s a reason why we re not talking about cosmos  for example   Warwick said        I just don t know how sort of credible that is as a long term solution   Warwick said Solana has made trade offs to ensure composability  where existing resources can be used as building blocks to create further applications  for the longer term and therefore has the best chance of unseating ethereum  Warwick said  I just think that we will end up in a situation where most things  the vast majority of liquidity   it won t be winner take all  but it ll be winner take most   Warwick said   My hope is that that s an optimistic roll up on ethereum  But I can see a world where that s not the case as well Two ether bulls break down 3 reasons why solana is an existential threat to ethereum in a  winner

one is his cousin  the dude on the left We re hapi now Thanks for the help I think your first statement is absolutely not true as others have been proven  See Fiat and Nano Yo I really like marinade to My computer from 2013 meets the SOL requirements  x99   Just need to buy some more RAM  The specs are not out of reach for anyone who can also build a 4k gaming rig  It doesn t even currently require a graphics cars  I just put a xeon 8 core OCed to 5 0ghz that runs the Sol validator fine  The bigger issue is I only have 40mb up Sol has extremely impressive working Defi  Try out Raydium yourself  Note the small fees  speed  and decentralized fees yourself  Web3 projects are also happening on SOL  It does 50k s transactions today and as a SWE myself there is nothing Id choose to work in for a side project over Rust C   C   Any LLVM lang works with Sol Yes  all state in Solana is global   Anything that is not globally known  is not state As I mentioned above   gas  is not needed   Just counting instructions But you don t need fees to prevent infinite loops in on chain programs   You just need the runtime  i e  validator code running the programs  to keep track of the number of instructions executed in a program and terminate it if it exceeds a threshold   No fees necessary I m talking about someone who just wants to verify that the chain is valid  not produce blocks  Thoughts Well first of all  everything that you don t want to be wasted needs to have a fee associated with it  or else the resources will be wasted In terms of validator compensation  necessary to keep the network actually working   right now they are kind of unnecessary due to the overly large influence of stake rewards through  relatively  high inflation Eventually  there will be very little inflation and fees will be necessary to compensate validatators But it s not like it costs them anything   They get more out of it than they put in   It costs everyone else who gets pushed further down the wealth scale as it continually stretches out and the top gets further away What Dex do we grab HAPI on Nor his cousin    SolarCity Tesla Energy isn t something to brag about  If I had brass balls I would short Tesla right now Please don t put Elon and Solana in the same sentence What does this have to do with Solana  which is PoS The won t be a 1 winner takes all  Don t worry  There wont be in the blockchain crypto space  Just like most other markets  Try look fiat currencies  Look how many thriving cryptos we got today  They don t even need to be legit to 1000x and get on coinbase 2021  The future will bring more alternatives to ethereum blockchain   not less Thanks Appreciate it No problem  anytime    get to 100 hapi and ya can come join our private hapi group in telegram Setting up a Solana node is still cheaper because of the minimum stake of Ethereum 2 0 being 32 eth and Solana not having one Legend thanks for this   just bought a  2k bag Yeah its called the halting problem  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Halting_problemSo theoretically there is no way that u can write  code  that tells if a Turing complete program will have an infinite loop  So there is no other solution than to charge gas There s a graph here that shows the distribution mate   I belive by the eoy there is roughly 650k in supply and then it will take a further 2 for the rest but with the new solana launchpad hapi have built there isna burn mechanism so we may never see 1m total supply   50  of hapi sent for ido in the exclusive hapi rounds will be burnt  https   medium com i am hapi hapi tokenomics d24bfe3fd939 Im not sure if Solana smart contract execution works similarly to Ethereum  so anyone can correct me if it does  but Fees serve a different purpose on a Turing complete platform  like ethereum or others  than they do for a non Turing complete chain such as Bitcoin  where they may act as spam resistance  In Turing complete systems  They serve as a protection mechanism against infinite loops  You know when your computer freezes and the spiny wheel keeps going and going and the only thing to do is to turn it off and turn it on  Imagine if that happened but on a blockchain  There s no way to turn it off and turn it on so instead the code running runs as long as there is fees to sustain it thats what you call funding innovation  than keep investing in projects like sol and hbar  GL and stop the fud Also sorry mate  any idea when the rest of the 1m is due to vest enter circ supply  Hopefully very gradually Cheers mate Yeah  damn these rich people for funding innovation that improves the world    Hate that exactly why  btc will never fail Rose and Elon s cousin invested in Solana  Any other notables Like u sensei_sparky has implied  all these folks have their hands in each other s opportunities  While the tech behind Solana is awesome and all  I think  cynically  that a key component of success of any new venture is How Many Wealthy and Powerful People are invested  Because they won t let something fail if they have a ton of skin in the game 5 presale  7 5 vc investors  10 public All rich people have there hand in something  wish they would take there hand out of the cookie jar Ok still a low supply just dropped  2k on this  What was ICO do you know https   www crunchbase com person lyndon riveAlso Kevin Rose  Creator of Digg com There is no such thing as zero fees  Nano validators are compensated through inflation  There is a tradeoff between fees and rate if inflation  Nano does not have a smart contract implementation  It makes sense to charge smart contracts gas for the number of ops executed  It is harder to keep a smart contract spamming  it might be even provably impossible for turing complete smart contracts gt  Sol also has a cooler and accelerating developer scene What makes it cooler  gt  I still don t believe its coming out Which parts of ETH 2 0 do you have doubts about coming out  It s a loose collection of separate updates  gt  The SOL is not decentralized makes zero sense to me as a FAANG SWE  Its more decentralized than anything I have seen from a technical perspective When I look at SOL vs ETH  I see SOL which requires a powerful computer with 2 SSDs and 128GB ram for its consensus nodes  and ETH which requires a modest CPU with a single SSD and 4GB ram for consensus nodes  This means that while regular users can verify the ETH chain with their consumer grade computer  they likely need to make an expensive new computer purchase to verify the SOL chain  Curious to get your thoughts on the decentralization of SOL compared to ETH in light of that Im not going to say coinbase is good or bad but it definitely does affect coins prices  Look at every coin thats released on coinbase this last year  All of them have a pump  some have pumped over 200  the week they release on CB   thats absolutely huge Circ supply is 195k  max supply is 1m You should be able to convert your SolFlare keystore file to a private key for your Solana Account Just bought a bag  Wow Why dont you use this Very simple to set uphttps   github com iamadamdev bypass paywalls chrome Says on etherscan only 195k total supply  Not 1m I only trust Kraken and changenow  Way too many and too often complaints from bunance and coinbase  Just my opinion Personally  I believe Solana will be among the top 10 blockchains in the years to come  probably top 3  I hope   Many reasons were mentioned above  many more  here  https   www businessinsider com crypto investing trading bull case solana sol eth ethereum investors 2021 5 utm_source reddit com   Me  I think the other players are too dev tech driven  Solana is also business driven and that will make a huge difference when we will arrive at mass adoption  But don t listen to me  If unsure and don t care too much about all the debate centralization vs decentralization  buy some on FTX  best prices by far   stake part of it  10  APR   7 days to unlock on FTX   transfer the rest to Sollet  and start playing with Serum  Raydium or Bonfida Don t understand the hate lol it s a valid alternative  Sure it s not as fleshed out as the flagship main Binance but it s still an option You have to spend SOL to add the token to your wallet  I have done it in Sollet  Its a very small one time fee U serious  F binance too I quit coinbase for same reason  whenever ther was a crush  coibase sudenly had to veryfy my ID  depite me doing this a month earlier  Now I have flawless experience on Binace  Ultra fast deposits and no issues with trading  Fees are low too  I feel bad for you guys for being excluded from it Also said Yes to his own post Scam link  Dont click  Check OP s profile Your post has been automatically removed because

solana  if you have any questions or concerns I got hacked  Funds from my sollet wallet were stolen   Trying to recover what i can   problem 1      cant access my sollet wallet  Before i could just choose connect on site and I could enter the password for my main wallet  Now im being asked to create a new one or restore the old      problem 2     cant find my private keys  I know    really fucking stupid not to back it up in a secure place    but i didnt  Is there anyway of recreating the main wallet so that i can only use my password to access the wallet   Problem 3     The account has been hacked and funds have been moved  I can see this when i enter my walletadress on solana explorer  So the hacker must have been able to access my private keys  right  is there any other way to access the wallet  im thinking   if the hacker found my seed phrase   i should be able to find them too    Any tips where these can be stored This is not they end of the bull run  but the market probably needs to shake out more weak investors before we can start climbing again No  but I have a question  do you need to have SOL in your wallet to hold SPLs   Docs seem to suggest you need SOL for rent and transfers I m not actually sure if Audius tokens are on the Solana network  they describe themselves as a hybrid  I d like to know that too Of course  it s 2021  it is the only way Did you put on your tinfoil hat before typing all this out Paywalled but I think they might be talking about  this podcast  https   podcasts apple com us podcast unchained id1123922160 i 1000523014032    Which is a good listen  anyway figured it out  extra trailing character snuck in on the pubkey  thanks there was a trailing character on the origin pubkey  not sure how it got there  thank you You mentioned a lot of layer 2 tech that  could  make layer 1 eth cheaper and faster than sol  is  today  Sol also has a cooler and accelerating developer scene  Real useful and working projects and shipping at incredible speeds  Eth having the developer mind share is a myth  In reality Consys had a brain drain after the previous bear markets and Eth 2 0 never coming out   I still don t believe its coming out Im biased but I think SOL is an obvious winner  Dot and and Ada aren t in a working state and their theoretical limits don t touch Sol  PoH is a major technical insight  The SOL is not decentralized makes zero sense to me as a FAANG SWE   Its more decentralized than anything I have seen from a technical perspective  A large percentage of tokens being held by whales has nothing to do with decentralized tech imo Haha ok bro  All the best in our SOL Sell the news  When BCH fork happened the media pumped that so hard in what very much seems like a coordinated pump and dump  Same thing happened with ZCL and BTCP with the cooperation misleading statements with Bittrex  Additionally CB pushed back its  sol release on CBpro  Hmmm  a conspiracy theorist might say that delay was caused the 60  owners   CB shares dropping their BTC value on the big dip to 31k  Additionally  ETH upgrade along with  dot   matic  and even future highways like  ela could end  sol long  Another point  many say  sol may be  better  now but we are so early  who knows what upgrades etc to other projects might change this narrative  Not saying  sol can t make money  short and long  but I am saying everyone might be getting dumped on very hard during the follow weeks after CBpro release and dumped on harder if  sol can t flip  ETH I own  sol  But the timeline feels super sketchy  Diversify to protect yourself  History has shows that the  best tech  does not win more often than not Haha too true    I m a compulsive checker  Ever since I started making enough cash to invest  I still think I m gonna wake up with no money like I used to Which version of the command line client are you using    solana   version  to find out Your command looks well formed  at least as you have described it   It does sound like the client thinks the original stake account pubkey is really a file name and is trying to read it as a file Is it possible that you didn t type the origin stake account pubkey correctly   Maybe you left a letter off the end  easy to do with copy paste    Probably the program tries to detect valid pubkeys and if there is something malformed about the key  it treats it like a file name and then fails to open it Paywall how did you write the command  did you just copypasta d it from the doc Bro if I have sufficient savings I wouldn t be checking the balance I will just continue buying everyday  amp  x200B  gt Everyday I wake up and check FTX to see what he price of Sol  then immediately    check my bank account to see how much    I can manage to convert that day Some bullish news published on Business Insider today  Anyone got a subscription so we can read this Would be great to use an exchange I already have  but I guess I ll have no choice Institutions are megalomaniacs  Pro Fiat debasing  Pro devaluation of all assets  I recommend do a search for  Wychoff  amp  Whales ftx us Why dont u just use ftx us it is way better Oof  I d go with DOT  For a low resolution answer is DOT is agnostic to chains  it s creating bridges between chains and has already built up a developer community Sol has technical advances that improve gas fees and speed  if it can convince developers to move over then I think it ll flourish TBH I know jack  so don t listen to me  All I know if you buy some lottery tickets  make sure you HODL  Last boom took 3 yrs to manifest I think you reading too hard into this bro  I been buying two or three everyday What is 2 more   2 SOL you mean That s like  60  USD worth  If your bank balance is about this amount  I think you are overexposing yourself  You should save up more Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this

post so people benefit from your experience  amp  so sorry for your loss I like that he mentions SolDate  I do think he s right  a part of mass adoption will be creating Dapps like this that aren t always about trading Like I said it was going to dip  It can dip one more time unless there s enough LPS then may trade sideways and back up Even though I don t understand technically enough  I just want to say keep up the good work guys   vested Hm  Not plenty  You could have just few people selling at half price and the price would show half  It doesn t mean that a lot of people are selling  Just the whole market is in decline I m like 50  on my deposits being successful  It s down all the time  I was frustrated with it yesterday Whatever it is  the timing was very good  It wouldn t have helped the price at all with BTC so fragile  Let s hope the listing happens when BTC is a bit more stable for a few days  so SOL can pump Probably because it was the first on the scene Your post has

 It takes 3 days  an epoch  to start staking  and 3 when you want to stop and withdraw it back to your regular address    You don t need to do any maintenance  there are no chainsplits  no impermanent loss  no vps restarts    easy breezy  Just pick a reliable validator   APR was around 10  30 epoch ago  8 5  20 epoch ago  and around 8  for the last 10 epochs I hope coinbase list SOL today so I can buy this dip The price halved recently   Plenty of people were selling I m thinking of investing in SOL  and I get these positive news everywhere  Right time to buy I guess Any idea why Coinbase hasn t listed SOL yet  Hoping to join in ASAP
2021-05-29,29.00313033,30.02233806,25.75094018,SOL is a 5  year bet   Platforms take time to mature and gain applications  tooling Seems like you didn t get hacked Hacked    incompetence Well those are reasonable reasons I have SOL on exchanges  why stake it Oh srry i thought i was replying on another sub lol i have sol on binance im so stupid Bot accounts claiming be be hacked and robbed  Ironically this has become the norm   unsure if the purpose is to make the community frightened of the coin or open a dialog with other uses to hack them   we see the same pattern day after day Sollet uses a cookie to access your wallet via password instead of having to restore it everytime with seed phrase  Did you clear your cookies  Sorry but without your seed phrase it is unlikely you will be able to recover Solana is on a bunch of exchanges   Binance  Gate io  OKEx  FTX  and many more   It has already announced it will be on Coinbase Pro as well   Coinbase has delayed the listing as it is waiting to for prices to go back up as they purchased the tokens at a much higher price before the market correction happened   Once prices go back up it ll be listed on Coinbase Pro It s on a good amount of exchanges actually if you check coinmarketcap or coingecko Binance  1 exchangeHuobi  2 exchange Bitfinex  5 6th exchange depending on the day And a bunch of other medium to small exchanges  The only major exchanges that are missing are Kucoin  coinbase pro  and kraken I thought of investing too due to its algorithm  but then I realized it was an inflationary coin  not deflationary  and immediately got turned off Who cares  It s quality over quantity They don t want everyone with the moon gains Yea i was thinking the same Funds are gone  Be aware that your computer is probably compromised Fuck mrbeast sure it s fake Don t like the vibe in here at all  He invested in solana when they needed capital to create this amazing project  There were no guarantees solana would succeed  yet many people in here are acting like he is disingenuous  Also  Elon Musk is one of the greatest tech visionaries to ever live  also one of the richest humans on the planet  He s had some twitter antics lately but I would welcome his interest in solana with open arms  That would open up a ton of doors for this project which youtube channel even this subreddit might be paid bots by Sam Bankmanfried lol gt Hop on their discord channel and they ll give you the beta code Refinable Totally  This is not good news for Solana  Ask anyone that bought Fine  Lol Solana is already available on Both ledger devices  You can  connect  your ledger device to a software wallet for staking  But Solana is not available on Ledger s graphic interface called  Ledger Live    I myself would be interested when Solana will add support for it  From what I understand  the developers for the blockchain has to build this  not Ledger itself What is this give away video Try to be careful next time bro  I hope it was not a huge loss Got history is it Every investment  related to the musk name makes me think I m doing something wrong   so fuck this guy honestly Exodus wallet is great You can stake from a Ledger wallet on SolFlare  There should be a few posts around talking about how or where you can stake Lol people who hate Elon bought dogecoin and never owned a Tesla Or copy my code if the link doesn t work well 29pkza9p72 I got mine in crypto com Use my referral link https   crypto com app 29pkza9p72 to sign up for Crypto com and we both get  25 USD Sweet sol sister in the tune of

                  On behalf of u coderunner3 No you are wrong  all time is for development  It should always be the property of the project  If development is not a priority in an industry that won t be usable by the masses for YEARS you investing bad    but then again I m a person who is not 100  sold on any of my bags and am constantly questioning them while also looking to diversify my portfolio  And I m dumb too  so there is that Bear markets are great for development  Less money talk  more real action How so Mate  Matic is a layer 2 solution  so no comparison here Yea  profits are dope     All the idiots in blockchain trying to get profits are so stupid After your blanket statement I know you and I    WE are the best  we  been in to the tech  blockchain  together  We are so smart  Congrats on buying at  3 50  I know I should have bought a  1 50 but I wasn t sold on the tech  I remember watching sam do an interview about  sol and it felt like he too was saying blanket statements  I thought it might be a scam  If he wasn t part of FTX I wasn t even gonna follow after that interview  So I hesitated and had to pay those  2 extra dollars  I m the worst  If we were not into the tech we would be buying at  30 instead of selling and increasing our bags 20  per dip  Making profit in a bull run is easy buddy Enjoy your search for an echo chamber of what you want to hear Jk mean  just kidding  btw This kind of NFT is fucking stupid No Sol is compatible with ledger if I m not mistaken Solana is already supported on ledger I nominate  Heart and SOL The 3rd one should be  Hey  Sol Sister obsolete  eth doesn t want to be      Aegontarg07      Commands   opt out    delete ETH doesn t want to be obSOLete Binance needs to add SPL token support No  It s a mobile wallet time to drop solana lol  mr beast will ruin solana Application wallet by my opinion one of the best is the Trust Wallet where you are able to Include many of Blockchains and of course Solana  Also you are able to add Tokens of each Blockchain inside Trust Wallet  Browser Wallet to use it in Luquidity of DeFis i think  Sollet io  https   Sollet io  works perfect but the interface isn t so good You mean a ledger app on your ledger device  If so that s been available for quite awhile now S Time to get out I guess This guy tanks anything he touches Except Cardano just sits in your wallet now  You

something to do with Bitmex SOL Perps launch on June 1st  Probably not though Not really worth it IMO to worry about short term SOL movements   the crypto space in general is plagued with a lot of bs at the moment  if that isn t already obvious Source  dude trust me right    Same color band doesn t mean they support it I know  also June if you join their discord there s a code  not supposed to post it on other platforms apparently i missed the reference Solflare Basically every time a validator validated some new tokens are created out of thin air and given to it  As the number of total tokens increase your tokens start becoming less valuable There is a sol giveaway on a different website  https   www solana2021 com  https   www solana2021 com  amp  x200B This is a live you tube video with the creator of Solana giving the address on the you tube video  How can this happen  amp  x200B https   www youtube com watch v D _x6Y8uO _ig Check out Raydium There is no such thing as a free lunch  Read the Solana white paper  the fee structures are very transparent  amp  reasonable Try the invite code SOLFARM  not sure if it s still good but it worked for me last week Send usdt to sollet  amp  do swap on Raydium  Step Finance  or any other Solana swap   it all goes to the same order book so it doesn t matter where you swap on the network Where can I get an invite The real problem is that each transaction isn t really free  The total power needed for transactions is paid to validators with inflation so each time someone decide to do a dos attack the inflation goes really high there might be security problems due to system overload but as I read above they might have found a solution to prevent this situation Not yet on Solana  but I think this might be interesting seeing as Alameda have a stake in them   https   oin finance   https   oin finance  Full disclosure  I own some SO you choose to address the easiest reply you could argue and not the good ones  Did you just make this post so you can try and sound right or did you want actual feedback Have they dropped the  coordinator  yet  Haven t followed that project in years lmfao At the moment an  NFT  in SOL terms is a single SPL with it s mint address removed   This has benefits  cheap to transfer  uses the native methods  decentralised  can be traded on existing dexes  but also disadvantages  no metadata  currently sold on existing dexes  We need someone smarter than us to build a featured NFT smart contract  or we need people smarter than us who work on the Solana core team to implement pragmatic NFTs as a subclass  sic  of SPL    I m thinking the former combined with a marketplace will come first  then it s up to you if you want to integrate with that  probably  centralised solution or do something else all tokens sold out Link to tweet https   twitter com MrBeast status 1398435635585761283 You seek profits  Solana is about tech Ethereum can just make a Solana bridge  They ll be fine  One thing they could do to compete is upgrade their protocol   governance so that it isn t inferior People are gonna shit on any coin that isn t within the acceptable mainstream at the time  Better tech doesn t matter  Just look at all the delusional eth maxis Who cares I third Phantom Wallet Can you use Exodus in Serum  I heard you can t I cant wait for the solana give away video lmaoo Yeah I read it weird  thought he was saying he doesn t like SOL  Ignore It means Elon Musk being associated with SOL would make it s price go up but he s a toxic narcissist who can tank it s value with a single tweet if the mood strikes him solfare is by far the worst Solana wallet i ve experience so far  Use moonlet if you re using a ledger  much better integration and UI is clean lol  people said exact opposite when market doubled after he announced buys Yeh  cause people living pay cheque to pay cheque are lining up to fund start ups in which 90   go to  zero What the hell is up with coinbase why lol exodus is good too Also a barely functional chain Fees defend from spam attacks  As long as Nano was brought up  Why do you think the exchange wallets are always up and down on Nano DAG zero fees easy cheap spam attacks How where can you buy HAPI  I haven t been able to find anything online Ledger Nano on Solflare I don t see a reason to tweet badly about Solana  It s years ahead of everyone else and a proof of stake blockchain For context  Star Atlas is a massive multiplayer space game leveraging Solana Serum for items and trade  Mr Beast has 62 million subscribers on Youtube Biased  Not one mention of MATIC scaling ETH or ETH 2 0  Right Dumb question  I m new to staking Is it 10  of your total coins owned  Eg if you own 100 SOL  you receive  10 SOL And at what interval  Thanks  ️ Would it save you a lot of time if I just gave up and went mad now Who cares about Elon  This guy is a cancer to crypto You can find most of the Solana Ecosystem coins on the FTX com exchange if you are looking to do trading but if you want to purchase the coins directly from the Ecosystem there is the Serum DEX  You can send USDT to your wallet and connect your wallet to the Serum DEX and do your trade  In my opinion it is the best DEX built on any blockchain platform Eventually  Elon will tweet he doesn t like Solana for whatever reason and Solana will take a dip manipulating the market as he wishes And thanks for all the fish I thought one needed a lot of SOL to stake I m new  though I think of inflation as being how  the dime candy bar of my youth is now a dollar  How does the crypto version if inflation pay a validator for providing resources to operate a blockchain God bless Solana Sollet io connects with most Phantom wallet Imo the most efficient is to get btc  send it to sollet wallet where it gets wrapped   amp  swapping that btc for spl usdc usdt Solong kevin rose also shilled sumokoin last cycle and it completely failed Your fundamental points are sound  but your numbers are off   Just in case you are interested in what the real numbers look like The median returns for Solana validators is 8 22  over the past 45 days   So a validator with 10  commission will get 10  of 8 22   leaving 7 4  returns for each staker   But not many validators charge 10  commission   only the high uncompetitive ones   I d say 7  is a more likely target for most serious validators   That would leave 7 64  returns for stakers  and the validator itself would earn 0 575  returns on all SOL staked to it Not much of a weakness really   There are 600 validators already   Exactly how many do you need before you feel confident in the security of the network For most people who want to run a validator  the answer is  one more   me    They re not actually considering the health of the network in any objective way  they just want to be able to run a validator  and the  decentralization  bugaboo is as good as any to try to make a case for why it should be easier for them Validators require very high performance hardware and very high performance networks and very skillful operators   It s what allows Solana to be so fast For that reason  the entry barriers are high   But you only need to capture 0 029  of the 335 000 000 staked SOL to break even   And you only need twice that   0 058    to make  20 000 per year above and beyond all costs It s doable  but it takes some investment and some time It s a more general weakness of dPoS I assume  The responsibility is somewhat more with the users to decide where to stake their tokens  and which validators to empower But I don t think PoW is better actually  In PoW you just can t do anything when there is centralization  All you could do is race them for more rewards but otherwise they will just keep mining most of the blocks and put that into more mining rate https   spl solana com stake pool This is one of the major weaknesses of Solana  hopefully the devs address it somehow What s that even mean lol Damn you Wallstreet    The opposite of DeFi So where would you recommend to stake solana Hapi is one of the most extremely bullish projects right now  I m planning on holding this long term can t wait to see where it is headed in 5  years Mercurial  Sounds like it will be the Curve of Solana  Lot of potential there imo Go sol go  To the  ️ KIN  by far  I will come back to this

well about 2 months ago  This is a good place to get feedback on stuff like this though  If your planning on hodling  staking is a good way to go Thanks   Never heard of Exodus until now   Appreciate the referral    I m a staking noob Yeah man  I ve been staking SOL on exodus  It s treat me well  No complaints at all  Super easy process  And transferring my SOL from blockfolio to exodus cost me nothing Why isn t Solana listed on Coinbase Good question  And one for someone smarter than me  I know you can hedge your risk by dividing your stake between validators though I don t recommend leverage trading or buying alts at all until Bitcoin recovers  Stick to spot trade for now  Also  never FOMO  Crypto market is heavily manipulated by whales high frequency traders It s a bad day for more than SOL for sure Is it unlocked staking I asked my lil brother and he said  Im not a SOLdier so how should I know  Get it SOL dier  then scurried away laughing  But also thought about SOL train or SOL soul what are the risks of your stake being lost due to Validator slashing Bought mine at gate io  Or probit  Can t remember Solmate I m game to HODL hard It should be on Coinbase by now after they announced it  Those Coinbase clowns shit the bed with integration so far though Looking at the chart trends over the past 48hrs  I m feeling like late tonight or tomorrow is going to offer us some good buying opportunities  for just about everything And it wont rise untill you sell  ‍ ️ SOL  as everything else  mirrors BTC  We are currently in a serious correction  It might last weeks or a few months before the continuation of the current bull market  At least this is the resulted TA from most models and experts Lmaoo  probably in the future hopefully Whales cashing out in Euro s   https   www binance com en support announcement c77a287e1695449fb31031e9321d7df6  https   www binance com en support announcement c77a287e1695449fb31031e9321d7df6 Check volume https   www binance org en bridge It s a conspiracy You have never lost unless you sell at a loss  Solana will without a doubt go far beyond  25  But it might take 2 weeks  2 months or 2 years  Those who hodl will know Sollet io If it makes you feel better  I bought at  51  It ll go back up  don t freak out Get a Sollet  Send from MetaMask It s also on uphold Defi esp  50k  tps   CLOB Try it for yourself DOGE  works as Phantom wallet code  not sure if it s available to without a code yet   so I ve heard Sollet Ok found some articles online about it Who cares Its useful to look at the cryto total market cap trackers  TOTAL and  TOTAL2 these  essencially give you an idea of whether money is flowing in out of the crypto market as a whole I am bearish in the short term  but long term this is a great buy price to DCA Price discovery from the bottom  Early adopters realized profits at the top  Now we accumulate for the next leg up This will be common knowledge with age and experience in this domain Welcome to crypto It s crashing because you bought  don t you know that s how it works Jk  sorry man  No clue  but we are all losing money together All markets   crapping right now  SOL included I was buy with extremely tight limits all of last week  kept on getting stopped out  Glad I had those tight stops on    Now I am out waiting for things to settle down  find a floor  I d rather miss 10  gains than catch a falling knife Also US is out liquidity is low  Markets move even faster in those conditions Thanks  Create a metamask wallet  get the Ethereum address  receive funds  convert to SPL USDT  are there any gas fees because of btc  nothing to do with sol itself https   rxoptical com eye health is dark mode better for your eyes   https   rxoptical com eye health is dark mode better for your eyes  Will give you an idea of why the struggle for the readability  When I was a kid  coding  in HTML I remember reading that white on black was a big no no as well at the time Phantom  invite code  DISCORD Probably folks hedging their futures exposure in eth btc markets  or short term investors who already did 40x this year and no longer care for the dealing with crypto volatility ERC20 USDT can be converted to SPL USDT via MetaMask  Send to MetaMask  then to Sollet  or other Solana wallet It s gonna go lower  We re in a bear market right now Yes exactly like that    Or like the fed printing money   The thing with bitcoin is inflation rates reduce every four years  the btc halving   So currently miners have two sources of income transaction fees and inflation awarded btc  Eventually though they will completey rely on fees as inflation goes to zero Every alt depends on btc and it isnt doing so well at the moment Read up on the different types of blockchains   there s Proof Of Stake  Proof Of History   Proof of Work  Bitcoin  and several more   Staking is a way that the chain keeps moving forward Got it  I never use the ledger LIVE app other than firmware updates or app installation  You will need to contact ledger company and maybe put a request to add that  Solana will not do this for you Exactly  I would like a Ledger live account so I can keep all my assets in one place and view them on one interface Hopefully the developers will make time to bring this into realization at some point in the near future Correct  but I would like to see Ledger support for an account Only with an app  not with a cold storage account No  an account on my Ledger device  I already have the app installed Like minting Bitcoin to reward solving a block I use solflare  there are a bunch out now tho Thanks what are the best systems for staking and holding SOL Sol is not on Coinbase  I don t know about other crypto Is Coinbase Earn staking The validator does  Some charge a fee to hold your blocks in stake  some are free  and made money through grants to build the network  There will be a list of validators you can choose of when you go to stake  they ll all have different stats  There are some good posts here about choosing a validator to delegate your stake to official reason is   technical issues  https   blog coinbase com solana sol is launching on coinbase pro 734ccb2511b2  Updated Friday May 21 at 11 08pm ET  We are experiencing technical issues that will temporarily delay the launch of SOL on Coinbase Pro  At this time we are disabling deposits of SOL  withdrawals are still available  We will provide an updated timeline for restoring deposits  amp  enabling trading as soon as possible Who else is making money off my holdings    Does the exchange profit too It s a cool system  Rewards for holding instead of trading swings Solana on exodus   10 32  apy Thanks I guess I just don t understand staking    I use Coinbase  Gemini  ftx  blockfolio to buy    I intend to hold for five or more years Right like what s hold up  I never seen one not go on the exchange  I know price would be bussin once it get on there I m looking for updates as well gt Coinbase has delayed the listing as it is waiting to for prices to go back up as they purchased the tokens at a much higher price before the market correction happened Do you have a source for this or are you speculating   ETA   If it was listed wouldn t that increase the price substantially  negating the price CB paid for it I agree  All mine are in stake accounts You earn a percentage of Sol every 3 days in stake  and helps build the trust network To earn more for doing nothing You can earn 10  APY for doing nothing That s reassuring  Thank you If you re worried about inflation  then stake to cancel it out  The network requires staking for security  as is the case with all POS coins  such as Eth 2 0 Stake it on moonlet
2021-05-30,27.40831498,29.74925499,25.65029323,I think real inflation is actually slightly less atm due to the longer than expected epoch times  This is why the staking APY is lower than advertised as well but the value will go down tho  if they are inlfating the coin what the diff between solanan and USD You re correct to a certain degree   But obviously don t know the complete process of an initial listing  An exchange has to purchase a certain minimum of tokens and also have people provide deposits of that token for liquidity to trade   There s much more than this that goes along with it as well but that will take way too much time to do a deep dive  as I work for one of the exchanges where Solana is currently listed  Catch up on your research a little more  and you ll get there What about the  HAPI collaboration partnership This    underrated comment It s listed on the major cryptocurrency apps Is listed on Crypto com also Great article  just wondering how secure and decentralized is the Solana blockchain FTX us is the best place I have found This is not true and so dumb  When coinbase lists it  you aren t buying the tokens from coinbase LOL they don t care what the price is  You are buying from another person and coinbase gets a trade fee  They could give 2fucks If it crashes 50  or not   Do you think when you buy shit on coinbase you are buying their coins     Wtf It s not on uniswap it s not an ETH token Lol 卖出吧 I m not a techie guy like you  But what I do know is speed  security and price are what make it big in the marketplace  Just look at Google  It wasn t the first search engine but it was fast  secure and better then everyone else  I m sure if you invested in Google back then you would have been laughed at  But where is Ask Jeeves now This guy gets it This guy don t get it cause everyone wants it What s interesting is we all know Solanas potential but I don t know about you  I kind of like that SOL hasn t hit the limelight yet  I just want to keep buying it up before the price goes up Same issue    still not fixed FTX  Binance Near sighted Nellie s everywhere You can send a coin like Litecoin  XLM  Bitcoin Cash to exodus or atomic then swap for Solana  I usually send Litecoin  It s fast and low fees to swap Try Decentralized exchange like uniswap Cringe  you have no idea how markets work  About time for me to leave this sub  contents braincells are diminishing DOOM Agree  Stop talking about cryptocurrency or bitcoin in anytalk  Just use the world blockchain projects  Put an old man to be the face of the whole blockchain technology would just degrade the advantage of the technology itself  I m not holding any of it  Just all utility projects The flippening is inevitable  First ETH will flip BTC in market cap  Then  one by one  smaller cryptocurrencies like ADA and so forth will take their turns flipping BTC BTC will enter a death spiral and mining will become increasingly unprofitable as the price drops  leaving only the very biggest mining ops and opening the door open to a 51  attack What I mean is   Bitcoin is the face of all crypto market   don t think is any chance to change that any time soon of course I wish it was possible fiddy milli No It s listed on coinbase pro  what s the difference  Cmn guys  research before Will be long forgotten when SOL hits 3k in December 2030 I had to read a lot about this project  Now I think I understand it better and decided to support it  Well will have to read a lot more to understand it completely    Bought on Binance  On my other exchange named Bitpanda it just popped up recently How do you set a stop loss in futures  I was told by a friend that you can t do it since it s futures not margin Do you know the cost  for the whole operation Coinbase pro are working with Kraken  to list it in the same day Binance are supporting them  so there is no major crashes and fluctuations  Also they are trying to get to another level of market exchange using Solana Blockchain for faster between exchanges transfer of coins  We are going on a next level market boys and girls  Be patient and enjoy the be era of crypto In contact with binance support   that also got hacked    they told me to clear cookies   so i did Ran the tron script   but will probably factory reset everything    reinstall win Im not a bot   just very stupid    its a lesson it def is Just buy  stake and forget about it Sollet basically the official wallet for Defi  Has Chrome extension Go to Serum on SolanaBeach to see the volume of SPL tokens Lol guy is big mad he got liquidated An article from a year ago that is generally assumed to be a personal vendetta of sorts against the project team   FUD 404 Cartman would be freaking out if he saw this Lol  according to coin  gecko  https   www coingecko com en exchanges  and  https   coinmarketcap com rankings exchanges  ftx is 11th and 250th in volume Yes buy when everything is peaking Should sell now and buy the top again  Even better If it makes you feel better  I leveraged long at  52 then lost everything due to an overnight flash crash of 50  b c I didn t set a stop loss  HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHH that was my life savings  amp  x200B Wish I had DCA d just on spot  no leverage not evm compatible  which is both a pro conrust is not very legible  but has many benefits as welldapps need to be scaled differently  also a pro but i see complaints  solana is up Andrew your api is down  but people confuse this as a solana issueits young newsome early sale tokenomics less than idealslashing maybe Same  Sollet is worst then any shit coin  Unbelievibe but that is truth Because of the old great father shitting on his throne and people just go panic because of an old man is the face of the whole crypto world  Like your father murder somebody and you automatically cannot get any job and no one wanna talk to you     Crypto world doesn t have kind of logic  just like Bollywood of Indian this doesn t really make any sense  though  Because coinbase would make fees no matter the price  they aren t selling coins that they bought LOL That s gonna be one heck of a Thanksgiving convo I bought some at  50  some at  25 last week    It s all just part of dollar cost averaging into a project that has a very good chance to eclipse Ethereum one day   What do they say in times like this I m not sure     Trust the process Rollup    solution A lot of devs are currently building on Solana  I am one of them   when those projects come into the light you will see a critical moment where all these layer 2s look kinda silly   ETH 2 0 should have been released by now  There is so much ETH locked up in that staking contract but they are still waging war with their miners  slowly removing the claws and teeth those bloodsuckers have in the project  gas fees and block size are a miner problem  not a platform problem  But in the meantime    uhh    sub second tx anyone     for fractions of a cent We are building a video game powered by SPL Tokens    Like    You literally power your spacecraft with an SPL    That would cost thousands of dollars in gas fees on Ethereum Solana is tomorrows blockchain  today Cause thou art super early   Buyeth as much as thee can ere t is list d     nfa     I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout Cause you are super early  Buy as much as you can before it is listed     nfa Inflation is good for Solana   Demand should keep up My guess is  like some other posters have mentioned  is that the delay is not due to  technical issues  like Coinbase claims  but due to Coinbase not wanting to sell while the price is depressed  From dealing with Coinbase support in the past  they re not the most ethical company Eth is about the same right now Aged well Moonlet Is it normal for the volume to be so close to the market cap  Is there a way to get more data about on chain over a longer time period   Solanabeach io  https   Solanabeach io  is to bear minimum data for me Kraken dawg What negatives or things that solana struggles with can you think of  The only con of solana I can think of so far is that isnt decentralized much  only 613 validators as of rn Is there a interactive map where it allows you to find out what the name of each of those solana app symbols I m in full blown buy mode rn Also accumulating through this phase  Five years from now there will be people kicking themselves for not buying at  300 I think this is not the best advice right now This I m worried of the price because I have a liquidation price dingus Link no work well where is your Solana Stacked Something about a Mr  Beast So true that it s not even funny This DIP moment most traders who not off position while market on the top turn themselves to  investors Cool    I just like letting my coins make me more coins    Depends on the individual as to what they re trying to accomplish with them    I m staking for more SOL    My goals may differ from others    So as an individual if you want to let your holdings make you more SOL   Exodus is a good wallet for that Posting shit like this shows that you re too worried about the price  Just don t look at it for a while and keep buying more I m in SOL to use the Serum DEX and DeFi I m staking my SOL with Exodus wallet    Try it   why not earn more SOL as opposed to it just sitting in storage    Cold or hot storage Full stack developer by trade here aswell and really interested in building something on the Solana blockchain Thanks Is KuCoin better the 1inch or uniswap If there is a man who has studied the blade Anyone know about Solana on Kraken Coinbase is in process  Started allowing SOL DEPOSITS last week  Trading is delayed and could announce any day much appreciated Cause SOL is not especial when BTC drops everyone follows click the list next to your avatar  turn on  Night Mode Buy USDC on ftx or ftx us us and send to your sollet  Most pairs on Serum are usdc Yes because the efficacy of a blockchain technology and its ecosystem is contingent on youtube   Great analysis  You must work for a hedge fund Tether is not dodgy  You can send spl usdt via ftx us or ftx   you could also send erc20 usdt from coinbase to ftx us and then spl usdt out of ftx us This is the most important comment for new investors You don t have to do anything to get these air drops  Is this region specific  I m USA  NY But it s not and the market has decided that Cardano belongs on the top 5  Every Sub Reddit I go to says the same thing that their coin should be where Cardano is    then what about XRP  Tether  Dogecoin  Bitcoincash Literally every crypto sub Reddit I go to  talks shit about Cardano Like first they said Cardano will never ship Shelly  now it s they don t have smart contract   like what are people gonna say when smart contract are enabled  It s a ghost chain I had this happen yesterday with a different coin  Make sure you have the Solana app open and unlocked on the Ledger  which should be plugged in  and you won t get that error i started accumulating COPE on FTX 2 months ago then transferred it to sollet io wallet because i plan to hold on to it  every now and then when i check my wallet  some shitcoins were airdropped on my wallet  the biggest amount i got was KERMIT which was worth 1k usd  the smallest was BOP which was worth 60 usd   then i just sell them at solape io  if it is listed there  if i want it liquidated Can you elaborate on this  I can likely spare a few KIN to equal that much  COPE Well to start binnance state that max supply is over 470 millions coins max  supply but it seams right what he saying if peoples won t invest  or leave the price more likely go down KIN RAY I don t get this hating on OP  Totally reasonable for him to ask if people who ve looked into it have thoughts  I m also wondering whether Avalanche has a shot of dethroning Solana as the most promising high throughput layer 1 biggest shitcoin there is Sol Ah  I see  Thank you The big short   Very interesting movie on the cause consequences of the 2008 financial crisis  and the one who saw the flaws in the real estate market  Must watch Do your own research or ask a more specific question https   solana com solana whitepaper pdf Ftx us  however  there is some KYC  so I actually bought Bitcoin on Gemini  transferred it to FTX us  and used it to buy Sol  Seems like a hassle at first  but I got Sol quickly while my KYC went through What would you otherwise be investing in Oxygen It can take at least that long depending on where you are in the warm up or cool down phase Wait until the next epoch starts  Check next epoch at SolanaBeach io  your stake should start to get activated at the start of the next epoch All Avalanche and the founders investors do is hate on other chains  I dont even see the comparison because Solana is humble and AVA is cocky  They need better business development as well as R amp D  That project Pangolin Dex was a flop as well as a couple other projects they launched on their chain or coming and I believe they tried to hide their double spending problem  Compare whats building on Solana to whats building on there  It s looking like more and more a ghost chain  That run up from them was probably from market makers too  I don t see it but it ll make people some money short term  I used to believe in AVAX but I can t anymore We need the latter And we need to have an open mind  Look no further than the history of how longitude was solved Keep your eyes on the projects  use them  amp  see for yourself You have to spend the time doing your own research  Marketing is a double edge sword  What I mean by this is  crypto needs people  but some people want to get rich as fast as they possibility can  and some people know they will get rich by being a revolutionary developer Small picture stuff What if people want to buy Sol with Btc You should look at a 90 day comp chart Not a lot of correlation  wouldn t worry about it Read their white paper https   solana com solana whitepaper pdf There is a hard cap on minting Fees earned by Solana are burned Inflation is just the rate of the remaining supply is introduced Stakers get a cut from validators  I believe the SolFlare wallet is the most central place to do this currently  I m certain Marinade will improve on this Solana doesn t really shill their tokenomics and I m thankful for that since I think that approach will keep volatility lower during the current development stage What movie is this Cardano Yeah Just use SolFlare to access your ledger wallet Oxygen probably has some of the clearest and most practical introductory documentation I ve ever read I m surprised no one mentions COPE  you get a lot of FREE shitcoins airdrop just by having at least 200 COPE parked on your sollet wallet  free money SOL RAY and COPE  cope gets you lots of airdrops Exactly   I have posted above with the actual numbers Second this   what s the bot talk about I m sorry  but what is this about Please do the research for me  thanks Srm solflare is just a website that interacts with the blockchain   Your ledger still holds your keys i left it a good 5 minutes and it just closed and came up a red bannered error it flickered every minute like it was trying to log in lp99oolo soon That is a falsehood   Exodus pays 7 91  APY over the past 45 days KIN Uh they don t Yes and when it does  it will rip higher   Load up now No I haven t with solana yet  I had some Solana on Exodua and I sent it to atomic with no problem  Depending where you live there might be a minimum amount you have to send but it tells you that before sending  Or you might have to wait like 30 min after exchanging it then send it Crowny looks like a really big project yea if it fall asleep usually have to log out and in again but still have the problem  which address did you use btw  root 0 1  etc thanks for your help my ledger is upto date and i just installed the app maybe i should have done the root address i will try that too They are leverage trading and can be liquidated that s why they re worried thanks ill try this You and me both Thanks  I just exchanged USDT for Solana on Atomic but I ve been trying to send Solana to another wallet but there s a problem that isn t letting me send it  And support might reply back to my email in 5 days because of other issues they have  Do you have any experience with this Double down now Not that it matters but I select account 0  or seed 0   For my stake account I staked with ledger nano s using solflare yesterday to test drive it and had no issues  I had most up to date firmware and solana app installed  I used the  Google Chrome browser Having the app open and ledger falling asleep was one thing that caused me a little grief  So watch out for that  I followed this video  https   m youtube com watch v TvXMSHCTj IHopefully that helps  if not let us know Check the OP s post history  You might get a chuckle out of it i did this yesterday and mine said the same thing   I just lef tit connected and let it think about what it was doing   I didnt click cancel  just left it on the screen for about a minute and it disapeared and then continued on   I know thats probably not optimal solution but it worked for me   I then staked it    It did take a few minutes to show up on the solflare screen but it warns you on there that it will Not a transferable coin there tho You should update the ledger firmware and have the latest Solana app version installed  That s the only thing I can think of that s problematic  I was able to stake with solflare and ledger but I used the root address  Maybe that has something to do with it  definitely connect to ledger live and update the firmware  idk if you have to move your sol for that probably not   https   docs solana com wallet guide ledger live  https   docs solana com wallet guide ledger

ppl get your advise  DCA isn t the  solution  here Wrong  You need to understand what a futures contract is Ledger is fucked right now with Solana stuff man  Can t get a clear answer from any Solana project devs about it  If you re using a Chrome based browser  it broke basically everything with Ledger  I can t log in to ANY web based Solana application besides Solflare with Ledger even on browsers like Firefox  Trying to find others having this issue but apparently basically nobody uses hardware wallets with Solana so nobody cares about the issue  Ethereum web apps are also broken right now with Ledger Yes  this guy is screwed Well at least  hopefully  we all learned something Samo is  a good buy right now Are you not depositing sol into the stake account when you create it  Not using the recommended derivation path when you connect the nano s on the access wallet page on SolFlare AUDIO  Next gen p2p SoundCloud   STEP one stop platform for any Defi interactions   COPE tokenize quantify Twitter users that have hot takes market calls Hey  Thank you for the kind words Solana has done the impossible by achieving ultra fast transactions without compromising the security or decentralisation  That s the whole beauty  It does not have a typical DPoS unlike other networks  and every node plays an important part  Solana s PoS system relies on a Byzantine Fault Tolerance  BFT  mechanism called Tower Consensus  For more info  refer to thishttps   medium com solana labs tower bft solanas high performance implementation of pbft 464725911e79For now I will only direct you to the relevant security audit  https   solana com solana security audit 2019 pdf  https   www reddit com r solana comments h0xv1d solana_open_consensus  Perhaps I might do a detailed article about the security and decentralisation aspect of Solana in the future I think your in to something  The move to Texas with cheap land to solar farm fits too Ohhhhh Ok then he s screwed  Poor guy I really don t think bitcoin has anything to offer  It has very limited transactions per second  is extremely energy inefficient  is centralized among a handful of huge mining ops  has high transaction fees  and has very limited smart contract functionality  It s secure and has a fixed supply  but you could literally say that about 20 other cryptos  Cardano has a fixed supply and ETH will become deflationary after EIP 1559 is implemented  Bitcoin is fucked  I m just trying the sound the alarm bells ahead of time Binance us works I totally agree with you which is why I think and hope that bitcoin and Solana will dominate the crypto ecosystem cardano SRM and  SAMO  As dumb as it sounds  Dog coins are here to stay  Memes don t die    Look at Solana s website  SAMO is listed  Look at SBF s twitter account  he is following  SAMO    SAMO team working on lots of new developments too  they re in the hackathon  Raydium listing soon  This thing is going to moon and ppl are sleeping on it right now Superior technology will inevitably rise in value independently  If the technology is actually better and has more use in the real world  that will eventually be reflected in its price RAY because I love it and it has a nice APY while you stake It s a two way street  Altcoiners hate when their coin of choice drops in value because of bitcoin FUD but have no issue riding bitcoin s coattails during every single bitcoin halving epoch  Crypto is still young and plebs think that bitcoin and crypto are synonymous so it ll take a while for any decoupling to take effect  I honestly think that decoupling would hurt altcoins and help bitcoin but if you think the opposite then keep at it  Let s revisit this convo in 5 10 years and see if you still wish altcoins were decoupled Yeah see I can t even remember it s name correctly  Thing is mercumrial came out around the start of the BTC crash  it should hopefully move upwards when the market begins a slow reversal  MEDIA hype was around the ATH  I did the same as you and dumped my tokens for USDC  then when it dropped I picked up loads on the USDC LP until it became quickly boring LMAOOOO I got media for free and sold it for  425 so I love media lol  But yeah mercurial was a bust You re missing the point  It caused bitcoin to fall and other cryptos fell because they were  coupled   The point of this exercise is to  decouple  from Bitcoin so when bitcoin inevitably falls the next time  it doesn t take the actual useful technology down with it Haha  Couldn t be more true  Same with mercurium and MEDIA token garbage Doesn t matter most of the time with these shit tokens  point is just percentage move and good advertising  Low cap coin  no major move upwards yet  low price range  P amp D shit A single tweet caused  all cryptos to fall RAY because I use it and love how it works compared to other DEX I ve used with ETH and love low gas fees with SOL  SRM because the way I understand  it powers RAY and has much greater functionality and massive potential  I scooped up some FTT via RAY because FTX seems like a major player and all this stuff is backed by Sam Bankman Fried Recently I ve been very intrigued by Helium  HNT  and need to learn about Oxygen To recap RAYSRMFTTHNTOxygen to be determined There is no  10 trading fees on raydium  your crazy bud A single tweet caused bitcoin to lose  40  of its value  Bitcoin is not an inflation hedge and has no utility  Anything bitcoin can do  other cryptocurrencies can do better  Bitcoin is not more secure or decentralized than other top tier cryptos  It s just worse AMC  DOGE  and GME have a combined market cap that is 1 10th of bitcoin s current market cap Or AMC or DOGE  Lmao you act is if there are fundamentals supporting bitcoin  It s the greater fool theory  Looks like you ll be one of the last ones holding the bag as ppl dip He has a liquidation point You dingus    He doesn t have two months or two years Ergo and ICP both have proof of work mechanisms  They have their place  Bitcoin s implementation is just dumb It s been under a trillion for the  vast majority  of its existence  You re just cherry picking the peak and acting as if that s the market value  The market value is whatever it s priced at now  not what it was a month or two ago What is the market cap of GME  dumbass Have you not heard of GME Quite some time  It s been like 3 weeks  It s hilarious that you think a few redditors have the power to influence an asset with the market cap of bitcoin Governments can collaborate to seize the biggest mining pools  10 dominate the entire network  and 51  attack the network  You can t do that with ETH or ADA It s been under a trillion for quite some time now  Looks like you need to check the number of zeros yourself this This is wrong You shouldn t be giving advise to things you don t understand So I see you agree that bitcoin will survive  Proof of work has a 30  year proven track record  Bitcoin has a trillion dollar market cap  do your own research to figure out how many zeroes that is  and has never been hacked  unlike ethereum   Bitcoin being  slow  doesn t mean it is technologically inferior  it means it values security over everything else  IMO  it makes sense to have a crypto ecosystem that has a slow  deflationary  super secure proof of work blockchain like bitcoin on one end of the spectrum to act as a secure store of value and then a super fast blockchain like Solana at the other end of the spectrum to power dApps and be a price discovery engine  Diversification is a good thing which means it is smart to have both proof of work and proof of stake blockchains in the crypto ecosystem The ones left standing will be the ones with the best technology  not the strongest cults Crashing   Need to zoom out  inhale  exhale  and have some perspective  Look where it s come from and look where you expect it to go  You are trying to be an early adopter of new and disruptive tech  It s not going to be a straight line  Dollar cost average your buying over the next year and don t add to the FUD with  crashing   And we innit together so I sincerely hope you do well because then we all do well The correct answer is serum once you understand the burns ahh  usually the best place to find trading id or tools on how to trade a specific token is to jump on the token s discord or website   https   samoyedcoin com how to buy  https   samoyedcoin com how to buy   you can see there in the bonfida link  but i don t think that works in US   discord  https   discord gg Gc5uecWZR2 Raydium is best for swaps imo Agreed  That s why I m sticking to SOL at the moment Got it  How could I find that trading ID for myself wtf did u just recommend radium  why do they have  10 trading fees please help me to understand make sure you re on  trading  in the top left where you see the trading pairs  e g  Ray USDC  there s a little circle with a     in it  click that  Market ID is the trading pair on serum  amp  solana chain  you need to use FR3SPJmgfRSKKQ2ysUZBu7vJLpzTixXnjzb84bY3Diif to find the SAMO USDC pair Market Label  SAMO USDC  i think you can actually name this whatever you want but this is what it is Base Label  SAMO  just the name of the token Click Add  Sometimes you may have to hard refresh the page afterwards Shift F5  but usually it works  You should see the orderbook  connect your wallet  and buy sell Try the Coin Gecko back alley I guess I don t understand market IDs Codes yet if you care to explain u work for coinbase  LooooooL awesome Thé problem with the step token is that it s useless  I also farm it but I really don t know why this token has any value Ya I did too   like just say ur having issues it s delayed foe a minute somthing It s a little tricky the 1st time but once you get it set it s easy to do again If you open up the dex by clicking on trade  you can add it  It s there There s a tiny plus next to the markets  Click that and paste this market code  Name is samo FR3SPJmgfRSKKQ2ysUZBu7vJLpzTixXnjzb84bY3Diif Slim If you re confused  just buy SOL what is  tier 1 listing I don t have Samo listed on Raydium  Are you in a different country Ya I have also Settle down  proof of stake maxi  All cryptos will inevitably die if bitcoin fails  which it won t https   youtu be 9AbCAjVbuV4 SoL FTT samo cope mer srm rayFtt and SRM burns are insaneCope free airdrops and killer communityMer just got investment from definalliance  LongRay idos and LP  the ofSAMO isy bet on the meme winner for sol FTX us  You can buy SOL  download a wallet like Sollet io  then from STEP or Radium you can by SRM  Have a referral code https   ftx us  a 5148883 Kin because when it gets a tier 1 listing it will It did  but it s probably only up from here  Or at least i hope  I think i got in around the  5 range  but i continued to farm it and I m really happy with the returns No that would be the first entry point on the asset   There would be nothing to  average  lolHe is trading f u t u r e s  not  S o l a n a If he has additional capital he can lower his liquidation price by adding funds  Will give him some more leeway for the swings but won t guarantee preservation of funds KIN because it has a lot of potential to go back to its ATH Do your own research  if you re having trouble buying Sol  don t buy crypto Agreed  binance lockup drives me crazy too I bought step at  6 50 and boy did it have room to move down Definitely use FTX over Binance if you re in the US SOL and SRM  SAMO would be fun if there was a reputable place to get it in the US 10 32  apy average staking in exodus Mercurium finance  and Step  defi tokens  lots of room to move  Good LP return Definitely misread OP s post  Read over the part about futures I wouldn t be surprised if it goes back to where it was stable at mid 20 s before everybody and their mothers pumped everything up  Just my opinion Crypto com Had to get to a lot of hoops to register

t deal with Eth gas fees anymore  I m in 2021 Thank you for the tip  I can t find them on twitter either  never mind Did you figure this out  can you just send the usdt automatically from FTX to the sollet wallet What is your source that hydra is years away That s a very general question that no one here should expect to be diligently addressed in less than 5 000 words There s also no dethroning happening here  Any chain that can prove useful will survive Golden rules in crypto    Never use a crypto wallet before quadruple testing it    Restore your new made wallet to see if the Seed Words   Key File works perfectly     Check if the password is saved  amp  test it too if it works  amp  correct That s what i do before depositing anything in the wallet  This is the bad part of the blockchain technology  you need to quadruple check everything before doing any transaction  Staking in your situation    There might be away to do that  Read from this post in Discord  amp  the posts below that  the solution is there    https   discord com channels 428295358100013066 735862435042295829 828347637153398834  https   discord com channels 428295358100013066 735862435042295829

what i do is I copy and paste the code on twitter  and you get the idea of what s it  hopefully one of these airdropped coins will take me to the moon Hydra is years away and not a general purpose scaling solution as is a state channel like Bitcoin Lightning that hasn t really helped Bitcoin scale The raw file is to be used on solana cli  Use it so that you can access your account Download the

a shitcoin that only tells its mint address  i researched it on Twitter and it said it is Degen Banana amp  x200B The problem is currently the Sol smart contracts  or smart contract in general  is not  natively  concurrent  it s meaningless  if possible  to run them on GPU Can on their website Sorry just one more question   When you receive these airdrops  do they have names  such as Frog  Sakita   etc  or just codes  Thanks It took a while cause if the tether vs us government law suit  Even then tether still might be in deep shit Yes I agree  same with reserve rights token  People holding from very early are going to dump once it hits CB It s still in beta and literally launched a few months ago  Patience young padawan No joke Try DOGE Depends what gas fees are on Ethereum Yes there are gas fees at have to be paid on the Ethereum end  in eth  So you will need to have Eth in your MetaMask wallet Look at the exchanges on CoinGecko https   www coingecko com en coins solana Yea I understand that  My point is L2 development seems to be at a snail pace vs efficiently composable Solana  I honestly don t see ETH progressing much more from here development wise  That switch from PoW to PoS  and also Sharding  may have some growing pains that Devs may choose to avoid  if  Solana is in full bloom by then A Solana validator node currently serves many different roles  The GPU is good the for roles where concurrency is much more import than clock speed  A good Sol box is basically equivalent to a high end mac pro  They can be built for much cheaper than Apple charged  Id say Sol needs a  creative professional  workstation more than a gaming rig It took a while for USDT to start trading  I m taking the opportunity to buy more SOL under 30   Gonna transfer some over to CBPro and as soon as post only mode opens  gonna set some post only sell orders from 50 up to 250      just in case that first candle moons It s more of a solution FOR Ethereum than a necessary achievement for gen3 L1 chains Solana is already fast  amp  interoperable with BSC  amp  Ethereum  What would you like it to achieve Theyr waiting til prices go up cuz they don t wanna sell at a loss https   docs solana com running validator validator reqsNot required at the moment Still waiting The SDK is general programming language which assumes using CPU  If switch to GPU  all smart contract need rewrite   https   docs solana com developing on chain programs developing rust  https   docs solana com developing on chain programs developing rust GPU is not a buzzword in the sense that it will provide great advantages to the Sol network when it is implemented  This feature isn t implemented yet  but when validators start using GPU  the scaling will really take off at the stated increase of matching Moore s law Is GPU feasible  GPU is not for general purpose computing  if there are too many   branches  the performance become very bad  and the smart contracts are   general purpose programs I was using dydx Looking for defi  not cefi solutions  Thanks What s gate Not currently but will eventually Was announced two weeks ago but then there were technical difficulties and we ve heard nothing for 10 days   Coinbase has been pretty crap at providing updates Your honesty is refreshing lol Does Solana use GPU at all  Validator does not even require GPU   https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs  https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs Is Solana using GPU a buzz word ish thing more SOL will be created  inflation  regularly for staking rewards  You can read up on their website Link to fees https   raydium gitbook io raydium exchange trade and swap trade and swap0 25  trading fee  0 22  goes back into liquidity pools  A  10 fee would correspond  to a  4000 position  which is comparable to a traditional exchange  kraken  0 22  taker fee   But here you could earning fees on that position when you pool farm your position i think a lot of those people get burnt and leave the market sooner than later CoinDCX is a fraud FTX US has it  you can t deposit fiat to the app itself tho Buy tether on coinbase and send it over If you buy a coin built on top of the solana network my understanding is you still need SOL coin to transact on the blockchain More positive news for the adoption of  sol and Solana   Slow and steady towards mass adoption I was 1 of those  Bought at  27 Cool  This is a promising project  A greater incentive for decentralized projects are ones funded by people Do you know if you get the Air Drop if you put you Cope in a liquidity pool on Raydium I just bought my first 3 Solanas  I like the symbol of it  It gives me nice neon miami vice  gta  vice city vibes  Apart from that I know nothing about the coin Gate io then if you don t already know I wouldn t be surprise if it jumps even higher when Coinbase list SOL In Solflare  If you click on the staked address in your wallet  a new screen pops up showing you detailed

Yield farming SRM RAY at 83  for now and the leftover Ray is Staking on Raydium at 30    The other Sol tokens seem too risky for now   Seems like Ray and SRM will move together in the short term so

with CoinBase figuring out how an SPL token will affect their compliance with ERC20 tokens  Binance US is on watch and CB has a naturally greater interest in their stock price not crashing more than it has will I don t if it s a scam but asking to register a ERC 20 wallet is a no go for me Ah ok thank you  I thought there was a more direct way  Anyway  I ll try to send a small amount to see if

projects  But for now raydium is a good launchpad with solstarter coming out Have you interacted with Solana Check out FTX  Raydium  Star Atlas  and Audius  Cardano seems to produce a lot of theoretical ideas  They won t let me post in their highly moderated sub  but consider this ADA market cap   50BSOL market cap   9BProjects have been built  and continue to be built on Solana So many popular ETH devs tweet that it s the solution but very few products to show for it The lowest inflation will get is 1 5 Make a game like Dark Forest on ethereum that anyone can play without waiting 6 months for permission You can also lend on FTX Mercurial Finance Yes Solana doesn t approve reject projects built on it s chain     that s the point of decentralization Solana is second to none when it comes to defi  transaction speed and cost are unmatched  Additionally  Serum functions as a  decentralized  central limit order book for Solana  My prediction is that Solana becomes interoperable with Eth Defi and will slowly become a global alternative for legacy markets Read more about Solana Serum here  https   www coindesk com serum token bankman fried empire gt BULLISHEnough with the hype  we want to see what Solana is Really capable of I believe the fees Solana generates would be passed along to the validators instead of being burned Swap it to USDC on raydium and then send that to

like Raydium  Star Atlas  and Audius I learned a lot on from their podcast on Spotify  worth checking out And there will be more and more You may always try to send small amount  dust amount like 0 001 WSOL  to FTX  amp  see what happens  or simply Convert them to SOL  amp  send them to FTX Lmao this is a fud post in disguise Can you stake from Trust Wallet gt My concern is that it seems very open and will allow anyone to create a pool  which opens the door for a lot of pointless coins that offer nothing  but also hopefully a good opportunity for some really useful projects to gain funding That s the very own nature of DeFi  that s why I question the need for another  dex  it s not that they re bad  just that at this point we need more legit projects to take advantages of this new space  We have already amazing projects on the solana platform yet few ppl know about them and certain ppl seem to only pump  new  coins with the intent to create hype  Otherwise it s becoming another pump  n dump  shitcoin  and wolves are going to have a field day with the sheep shorting Solana to the ground if the status quo it s allowed to continue Yes   Staking rewards increase the amount of your staked SOL  which means that the rewards are staked  which means that they earn rewards as well It s a fantasy though   It s actually about 8    After inflation it s around 2    3 Coinbase execs

other coin  solana goes up  whats up with this The pool automatically rebalances itself so that there s always a 50 50 split between the two assets  For example  If Cope goes up then it ll sell some of the COPE for USDC to keep the pool even and Vice versa if COPE goes down it ll sell some USDC to get COPE balance back upAnd you re correct impermanent loss doesn t effect stable coin pools  however COPE USDC is a crypto to stable pool  a full stable pool would be something like USDC DAI or USDT USDC Amazing similarities between r Solana and r kinfoundation Thanks for the information Cope

knowledge you have on Solana  It s been great journey already with you all  amp  we hope the future for SOL is as shiny as the Summer Soleil  Sun in French hehe Yep  you got it As far as I researched on my own Solana seems to be a decent project Despite I m a fan of the crypto world overall and love to support the emerging tech  I m currently wondering what levels of price Solana can realistically reach  100   200   500       I m too fresh into the financial aspects to give a solid price range regarding price per token  circulating supply  etc Do you mean paste the code to the  market ID  field Thanks There was an ido on raydium  You had to stake at least 50 RAY for a week then lend some usdc to the launch pool  then you get allocated a portion of the launch tokens Thanks  I had read a bit but thought earlier that it would not affect in case of stablecoin pools   But how does the amount of e g  COPE reduce in COPE USDC pool  Can I somehow change the ratio of COPE vs USDC in the pool  on Raydium   seemed before that it would have to be 50 50 Root 0 this is what my ex said gt how to understand the concepts better and try to comeup with defi protocols  I understand this question is very vague but how can a newbie get started in defi and learn the concepts What you re looking for in here needs a Developer background  if you have the knowledge about programming  developing  you will understand how Defi works  how it really works behind the scenes   not like we do as the average Joe  gt 2  how do you decide on one idea  for startup ideas I used TAM SAM SOM etc   are there any indicators for ideas in defi space  How do you validate one idea is better than the other The idea is basically built on solving the current problems in that specific niche  since we re talking about Defis  you can choose a common problem s  that is not solved yet  amp  try to solve it or make it less   problematic   for the average Joe that will be using your dApp  Defi   gt 3  Once you identify one idea  how do you go to market Once your product is ready  i suppose it s time to market that  marketing   or make your own Sale  ICO  IDE       get some VC backing you up at early stages  that s how it is I don t think SOL margin traders getting liqd the past few weeks will have any meaningful effect on SOLs long term price  I also don t think there are many people in this sub not in it for

hodl on  lt 3 ON EXODUS EVERY 3 DAYS I think TrustWallet is using different  by default  Derivative Path other than Sollet  so it doesn t give you the choice to choose the Derivative Path  i might be wrong   If it does give the choice to choose the Derivative Path  just choose the one that has your sollet address Before creating the SOL currency project  Anatoly briefly mined bitcoin  but he didn t have a high opinion on it all  That is until one day  he realized that he could take blockchain technology to a new level by introducing a decentralized clock and timestamping transactions  Syncing all the network participants to one network supported clock would increase scalability and transaction throughput without weakening the decentralization element and the overall network security      Mr Yakovenko put his thoughts in writing  In November 2017  Solana and its native SOL coin were presented to the general public in the official Solana whitepaper  The project conducted an ICO where it raised over  25 million across multiple sale rounds  The SOL crypto mainnet became operational in March 2020  but the project is still officially in beta as of May 2021   amp  x200B I love this write

More time to buy at  22   Yes please     ‍ ️ We have to keep in mind that the main difference of all of these DEX and LP on solana chain is VASTLY different than any other blockchain s swap or dex because of the simple yet incredibly groundbreaking fact that everything supplies liquidity for the SERUM dex as a whole    this has never been done before  there is no vampiric effect of sushi swap had on uniswap and so fourth   so we welcome w open arms any sort of fundraiser or dex on solana chain  amp  x200B We are supplying liquidity for the serum dex and solana as a whole  everyone helps

downvotes a couple paper bois xD I know not financial advice but    what does a safe   strategic leverage trade regimen look like  Youre mean only allowing 3  variations in price to be what you re putting margin on  and you re flipping between longng and shorting with limit sells  stop losses set in place  Ty Totally  I think we re in agreement but with different ways of expressing it  Best of luck Anything more is like a 0 6  margin which is absurd for crypto  These are idiots that don t know anything and will blow up their account and probably never come back eventually  Over time soon enough there will be more and more bulls and responsible leverage traders and another catalyst for a leg up in the market  Matter of time  This is good imo  Overall more upside is cooking yes  there are others airdrops happening  in the 2 months I hodl COPE I probably received 5 6 airdrops already With all trading all individuals need to do their own research and invest to their own financial situations  Understand the aspects of leverage trading pros and cons  I m not against people being educated  If you re going to invest you need to be educated unless you want to just throw away money  Uneducated investing is like playing penny slots you ll lose more than you win I been buying and holding long term  Solana is life Any living system like human  plants and animals need energy to

anyone s Dad Hi a hodler and the recent fluctuations haven t affected me  I m dad That s awesome  The more long term investors the better for the crypto market overall  not just Solana  I m a hodler and the recent fluctuations haven t affected me  But the trend of uneducated  reckless margin trading will fuck up crypto in the long run  acknowledging there are informed and successful margin traders out there  albeit rare Thank you Sollet extension People can do what they want with their money You don t at least want to inform them so they make educated decisions  There are dozens of searchable posts where newcomers admit to being liquidated  It s clear there is a pattern The least we can do is make people understand   their own risk and the risk to the whole market If your response to that is  I do what I want  then yeah cool  But the institutions will continue to profit and the little guys continue to get screwed Booo I leverage trade  I m here to make money  a couple projects I really like and hold I also short coins to make money when things turn bearish People can do what they want with their money Hi from from virginia  I m dad He s like I m from from Virginia Speed  security  and  timestamps     Solana is peerless  and all of that will come out in the wash over the next few years If you don t like volatility and or don t know how to hedge  I d advise

3Sols each amp  x200B Thank you LMAO this is one of the most delusional write ups I encountered in a while  Go moonboy  good luck   All major blockchains are infinitely scalable technically  even if they don t support it yet  However there first needs to be a need  People don t understand that blockchain solves a single problem  Decentralization  You need a million transactions per second in a single chain  For what  There are side chains  for one  With that pretty much any blockchain can process an indefinite amount of data  All you need is a smart bridge between them  Nobody is ever gonna run anything substantial on blockchains simply because IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE  Blockchains handle the decentralized part of the core business logic  They don t need to be fast  they don t need low latency and they don t need high TPS  They need to scale indefinitely  in a way  because the world is large  but that will be done via side chains  not through the main chain I actually have no idea because I only use sollet When the daily RSI on BTC gets over 40 we might see SOL launch on CB Only  sollet  Can I use phantom wallet Can people stop leverage trading  It has a negative impact on the

Margin Call Hi not buying any more  I m dad Mostly just Sol  I own a bit of ray  and I love the platform  but Idk much about the tokenomics   The fact that all the staking rewards  liquidity mining  are paid in RAY implies that the asset is likely still quite deflationary so I m not buying any more  Were I not already satisfied with my allocations I would probably research it more though face it  from now until forever there is always going to be a new kid on the block they really need to add more details on the Solflare page I was in the same boat  checking daily wondering wth was going on It was my first time staking so I thought I had fucked up but the status eventually changed and it s been working great The status should update for the next epoch  Don t expect to see rewards until after another epoch or two what do these things do Yea and those track fake volume exchanges   Lol RAYdium  Great product for use case and functionality  the 20  Staking rewards are a great bonus too Lmfao Yield farming on Raydium using COPE   USDC It is a DEX but I believe it s main function is to allow people to create a pool and raise funds for their projects  My concern is that it seems very open and will allow anyone to create a pool  which opens the door for a lot of pointless coins that offer nothing  but also hopefully a good opportunity for some really useful projects to gain funding KIN  FROG  SRM I have no cope to swap  I just don t even have the option to add new cope to sollet xcope is the old cope  you need to swap it to the new cope at swap unlimitedcope com  or you can

have enough sol to pay trading fees for a lifetime Also how do you think it compares to solstarter  Currently in two minds but I m very open to anything being built on solana right now I guess my only issues now are having less than I thought I did and only seeing xcope listed yes sir  you just park your COPE at your sollet wallet  at least 200 of it and you will be automatically airdropped some

validators perform just as well as large ones   A good proxy for performance is https   stakeview appThere you will see actual APY for all validators  reliability of a validator shows up in APY since downtime reduces APY   You will see that there is no advantage to large validators But delegating to small validators has the increased risk too  Doesn t it Did the solpad team mess up the code or has

know right  Solana fundememtals are very promising And what that accomplishes gt Haha KIN is dead coin Ppl have been trying to kill kin for how many years now    and yet it s thriving gt I found out about Audius recently  haven t used it but sounds like a great project that s not related to DeFi That s my point  Solana is built for high throughput  DeFi alone won t cut it  gt Star Atlas is being developed  I m not a big PC gamer  but the concept they have developed for a metaverse stands out to me as nothing short of remarkable We need more games and so  preheaps MMORPG that uses a dex to trade in an digital economy Yes  all I m saying is that preheaps we should ease off a little with the hype  a lot of ppl are going to be in pain when things come crashing down Btc will keep dropping and solana will be shorted to the ground This video is painfully long  Why didn t you make it shorter gt  https   medium com solana labs sealevel parallel processing thousands of smart contracts d814b378192I don t think that GPU execution of on chain programs is implemented fully   I think that the GPU only does PoH verify in parallel right now On chain programs are in BPF  which is a pretty simple bytecode   Perhaps with some tricks they can make it performant enough on GPU that although it may not be the fastest GPU code possible  the overwhelming amount of parallelism makes the overall execution faster than on CPU By the way  alot of what you read in documentation about Solana is either out of date  or describes intentions or plans rather than the current reality   And it s hard to tell which is which  i e  it s hard to tell which parts of the documentation corresponds to actual operation right now versus plans for the future versus abandoned ideas   I suggested to Anatoly  founder of Solana  that they should hire some tech writers to clean all this up  but nothing so far Hi hodling  I m dad Me too one of the new sub   Joined a few days ago  amp  I have faith with SOL

I wanted a proprietary Ledger account that I can directly access without separating it from the rest of my portfolio  Mostly for consolidation    I m glad it suits your needs So  litecoin had been trash this long I won t use your referral  cause I already get sol on uphold along with xrp I think you have that backwards  The app ledger live has nothing to do with cold storage  The keys are still on your ledger  I actually prefer it cannot hook up to the app so I can t easily check the price or sell  I just put the ledger and recovery phrase in my safe with my gold Keep guessing Before blindly investing in any coin token  go through the white paper  Do fundamental analysis  study tokenomics Echo  system You already provided the proof that you made it up You said you called me out for making stuff up but then refuse to provide any proof that I m making it up I ve tax harvested and consolidated heavily into  SOL over the latest crypto purge  I ve even started DCA ing for the first time since last year  If Solana gets hit again  I ll continue to stack You keep saying the same thing over and over again   The GPU can be used for parts of the Solana validator s operation that is a good fit for GPU operation   Hint  PoH verify I am no longer interested in this conversation  You are just rehashing what you already said  Good day sir 65 is my near term prediction Hello fellow father  I don t believe Cardano has given a rough date yet for Hydra  So how could it be less than two years for Hydra knowing Cardano s history of missing big deadlines by a year or more considering they haven

Markets  SolFarm if you re into DeFi  Step Finance too  I believe Raydium is the only one of this group that has graduated from Alpha officially Mercurial Finace is close    I found out about Audius recently  haven t used it but sounds like a great project that s not related to DeFi Star Atlas is being developed  I m not a big PC gamer  but the concept they have developed for a metaversestands out to me as nothing short of remarkable I agree  and I think their issue with market conditions has more to do with volume and liquidity than price  The market changed  and now they re not going to hit their previous volume projections if they open up Solana trading now Yes all get the same APY So what is different on this one from Solstarter Solanium and all the different launchpads Well tell SolFlare to make a fuckin mobile app then  In the spirit of decentralization I ll move half of my SOL over once they do   not all of it Do the others offer the same APY Click on staking   where it it gives you the option to unstake  The balance may   will be different which includes the interest earned Both are cryptos and have same purpose Solana is proof of stake  Proof of history isn t a consensus mechanism  just a mechanism to prevent blocks from simultaneously being emitted  This allows them to decrease the block time without affecting consensus  otherwise you might get runaway softforks all the time I think the new solana design dev mentioned on twitter about looking into naming validators according to a styleguide   like having names auto generated for users that aren t a bunch of random numbers and letters but rather things that are thematically related to solana Hmm this is kind of concerning to me actually  if Solana became really big even if it didn t use as much energy as Bitcoin it still would be using a lot of energy  I mean  YouTube uses a ton of energy just playing videos  If Solana is going to run an entire decentralized internet  holy crap that s going to be a lot of energy I ve had my SOL stacked since April 10th but I don t see any of the rewards  I originally staked 22 3 SOL and I still have 22 3  What am I missing gt they don t want to sell at a loss Good luck with that once the bears start shorting Solana I think Coinbase is waiting for better market conditions  I would also think that it s possible Coinbase purchased Sol prior to the market crash and they don t want to sell at a loss FTX doesn t run on Solana  though they are big supporters of it  Serum runs on Solana yeah  for people who bothered to do any DD  the people behind Mercurial are pretty respectable figures in crypto Nice  I just followed as well I posted the same question on r ExodusWallet few weeks ago No  it will not reset the entire amount Great news Not in any way that is meaningful with respect to the topic at hand No pnd here mate generally very happy and bullish on this partnership  Another medium article and official announcement from solana themselves coming any time now aswell Stake rewards are earned with every Epoch ends  meaning only when the current Epoch finish  you ll gt your rewards  As for staking  if you delegate during the current Epoch  you won t earn anything when it Ends  you ll have to wait for the new Epoch so your stake get into the network  then then next Epoch  you ll get the rewards Why are all PnD posts the same gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them Nice  DYIDAO s     this will be a strong backbone for defi Mercurial is doing a project similar to Maker rn Can t find anything specifically in Nano s white paper  https   content nano org whitepaper Nano_Whitepaper_en pdfSolana is pretty fast   check out FTX sometime  It s faster than TD Ameritrade The Solana white paper  pinned at top of sub  is more specific than Nano in terms of how they discuss speed  See for yourself I guess my comment was misleading  I haven t bought any  and I d like to begin buying https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs Solanabeach io Best possible answer There is a bug going around but it s not with sollet or ledger it s with chrome  check the discord s Nano doesn t have smart contracts  It s literally just a value transfer app  That s a limited use case no matter how much you love zero energy usage So you must compare apples to apples  The world is excited about DeFi  which requires smart contracts  which requires speed  which requires incentivized validators while maintaining decentralization   which ISN T FREE  The servers that host the dApp interface use energy on every blockchain   including Nano  Again  literally nothing is zero Let s start here  A nice gaming comp has a 600 1000w power supply  Usage will vary but you can do the math from there if you assume 24 7 usage How did you buy your other sol Love hapi  best logo in crypto Did you try step finance  I can see all my finance information in solana blockchain You can do the math if you want   There are approximately 600 Validators  each using less than 1 KW  so less than 600 KW   This is for about 1 000 TPS   Compare this to Bitcoin s Terawatts for 7 TPS   The difference is so stark that it s almost not even worth computing the actual values   Compared to Bitcoin  Solana uses approximately zero TANSTAAFL   Transcations cost energy  and usually disk space   Somebody has to pay for that   Transactions that are significantly complex  smart contract invocation  cost considerably more than a simple balance transfer   Somebody has to pay for this   If your favorite crypto says that it s free  it s just hiding the costs and you are believing it Even better  I m staking for the first time  waiting for my first rewards too  I guess I ll find out in about a day and a half So huge people don t even realize the potential here This is going to set the bar for future IDO s   protecting people from scam projects and rug pulls  Solana is a BEAST and now it s getting beastier   The standard is being set  What are you going to do BSC  8 hacks in a row Not exactly correct    At the end of the first epoch  your staking account will be delegated and you will start earning rewards  although they won t be added to your account yet At the end of the second epoch  your first rewards will be added So really  should never be more than about 6 days to see your first staking rewards even in the worst possible case Oh sorry I didn t see your response   I ve been running 0  commission for about a month now   I have grown to 2 7 million stake   I am worried that when if I raise commission  I will lose significant stake   At the moment  the 2 7 million is enough to break even just on block rewards  no stake commission needed    Running the validator has been interesting and rewarding   I ve gotten very involved in discord and reddit with regards to discussing Solana and trying to help educate people where I can   So far     I m very glad I did it No it s not  If Nano had prioritized Zero usage instead of decentralization  it would still have no energy cost but a little fee to stop spamNow  I see that all cryptos have problems with scalability and Solana apparently solves it  seems good  but Solana still misses in a lot of points and needs more updates Also that  Even tried unplugging it and plugging it back in No I can t do the math   high end gaming PC  is not an measure  I am talking about how much kilowatt hours each transaction costs  at least now I know that it costs energy No whining here   Learn some manners Scratch that just tried again via manual approval  amp  it worked I have pm ed u Have you tried to log out and log in again That makes it make sense  Thank you Thank you   I am actually installing Telegram right now  I was trying to avoid it  but I will give it a go just to communicate on this issue   Thanks again I will forward ur message to core team and get some contact info for you Thanks for your interest Hm  I run a Solana validator and I think I ve done my fair share for the ecosystem   But I don t use facebook  instagram  twitter  or telegram   The article mentions that  validators with social media presence  will get these Boca Chica tokens   Does anyone know how to contact the people behind HAPI without using social media   I do use reddit  discord  and email focus on videos discussing the ecosystem  amp  not price I want to buy more Sols but they are not available on my exchange Yup I ve tried that but no luck  I ve tried via manually approving the TX  didn t work   amp  have tried via allowing automatic TX approval from swap unlimitedcope  No luck with either Can we get a minimum karma requirement for this sub  This is getting annoying Hi sb2727  how do you manage to import your solana wallet history in koinly   You can read this  in some countries it depends if you are staking with the evident goal to make profits or just as a hobby  https   koinly io guides crypto tax canada   https   koinly io guides crypto tax canada Sometimes you might catch it at the beginning of an epoch rather than the end  And each epoch is approximately 3 days  but varies  You can track them here  https   solanabeach io  At the end of the first epoch  your staking account will be delegated At the end of the second epoch  you will start staking At the end of the 3rd epoch  you will start receiving rewards At least that s my understanding  So that would take 7 9 days Whoa that s fire asf  Thank you  Good man Can someone explain to me like I m 5 why this is big news Their UI doesn t show the total balance on the main screen  You will be able to see actual balance  staked   rewards  included when you go to staking screen or try to unstake Yeah I try that and nothing Weeks    As I understand it Exodus stakes to Everstake   I m wondering if there s a way to get some answers because if it s gonna take weeks I ll just unstake and find another place to delegate It doesn t show on your balance  Click on the icon that will take you to your  staked amount   You will see the rewards here every epoch   not on the balance on the Home Screen same issue  it s been weeks Yes Thanks a Million  one more question why is it this subreddit has words written in white colors and background is white  I have to highlight to read the answers in this subreddit  I can provide a screenshot if needed  I don t get it Each validator pulls about a much as a high end gaming PC so if there s 600  validators  you can do the math  Zero usage is a pipe dream  EFFICIENCY is key No gt  Yes You will need to transfer your SOL into your Solflare account  Search for some solflare staking tutorial videos on youtube  Always do a test transfer with a small amount of SOL  If you intend to go through a  process   go through the entire process with a small amount of SOL before doing the whole process with a large amount of SOL  If there are any follow up steps to the process  do the follow up steps with a small amount of SOL before starting the process with a large amount of SOL  Crypto is complicated and it s easy to make mistakes and inadvertently lose your SOL I couldn t get it to work  Phantom wallet works with ledger though You can t convert Eth to Sol on MetaMask The tutorial   link from first response is legit Yes but I don t see it as a bad thing overall  It s indicative of user migration which is what we want  No scammers  no viability and thus   no price appreciation It s shouldn t considered as  safest  by price but safe because HAPI is a cyber security protocol all alone  safest because anti rugpulls and scam projects  You should see their boca chica medium paper and HAPIs damn  we can t catch a break with these guys It s a fake account used to shill projects  Scammers are getting lazy  And yes  they are coming to Solana out of curiosity what makes you say that this is the safest and most inivative IDO platform  I love solana  i am happy to see a new way to participate in new projects  but comments like yours make me think that there are moonshoters on the way and i don t enjoy the volatility that it causes This is great  can t believe I ve got into hapi at these levels  and so early on

for the long term  All that buy now will achieve life changing wealth Yeah my rewards took longer than 4 days as well  Make sure to refresh the blockchain if you are on desktop to see rewards in your balance Much HAPI Ohh so are we all HAPI now Year  for many it s just where to put the money than actually understand the workflow and technology Fantastic news    The most innovative  safest IDO platform  Amazing The news we ve all be waiting for  With  HAPI on board we should absolutely moon when BTC settles down   Might even get into  HAPI myself  I m hearing so very promising things Exclusive round for  HAPI holders  Better stock up while the price is cheap gentlemen Maybe it s because it was importan to stress for what is was used for  idk haha I completely agree but then again market value is no measure of success  Look at some of the projects with so little value and yet so much money  I think what matters is the adoption and understanding the technology Yeah  we have a lot more to go   but Solana deserves more attention than it has now Low level of creativity hahaha It s a Python based library called bar race Thank you for your suggestion  I will make it shorter in the next videos Surprised Serum   SRM  isn t higher on this list   IMO SRM should be everyon s 2nd largest bag in the Solana ecosystem Don t get me wrong  I hold and think projects like RAY  FIDA  OXY  COPE  and all the other tokens are great  but Just about every DeFi product built on Solana will tie into Serum s central limit order book to create markets   I recommend reading Sam Bankman Fried s  ultimate vision for Serum  https   projectserum medium com an ultimate vision for serum 473a16e77201  and the team s recent  ecosystem update  https   projectserum medium com serum srm and the

for transaction costs gt 	until there s slashingThis is a key distinction that s going to come into play soon hopefully I m from France but I m interested by this event   will try to join For me

verification  which is one of the biggest compute bottlenecks  It is a surprisingly expensive operation  but GPUs are ideal because it is a context indepent operation  so the branching problem you mention is not relevant  The network usage isn t high enough right now  so most validators just use CPUs why uphold So  I ve made a test and WSOL was not credited to my FTX wallet It s funny to see how back in days it was always COIN at the end of each crypto Are you serious https   artmoneyprovenance com 2020 06 04 solanas snowball of lies entraps sol holders after a month long coin burn

infographics To make Solana more decentralised it is recommended to choose small validators than those who already own good amount of stakes The rate of interest doesn t vary much and besides 1    2

2021-06-02,30.93523785,35.03815395,30.43285658,From what I understand they had to use Solana to fix some issues with sharing streaming higher quality audio files They don t use Solana for everything  so maybe their token is ERC20  I m guessing  I m not sure their if their token was even mentioned on the podcast  founder discusses mostly technicalities re problem solving  I recommend the episode to anyone interested in blockchain Exchanges just cant list it cause they want to  It could be Solana  The exchange and developers have to coordinate together Mine also arrived  Wasn t thrilled with the quality  but it could be worse check the value of the asset you are receiving its 7 10 lower then the value you are trading Samezies   ty gt  So the Sealevel runtime is designed to allow of parallel execution on CPU  and eventually onto GPUs as well when that time comes  And this can all be done without smart contract devs Thanks  This is the part that I don t agree  I checked Sealevel  it s basically Rust without many std libs  not  natively parallel  language like CUDA  By nature  the code written in Rust will contain a lot of branches  Thus I don t get how  eventually onto GPUs as well when that time comes  And this can all be done without smart contract devs   could ever happen  This lead me think the claim  The system scales naturally underneath them  is not true I don t think you can transfer sol from uphold at this time   They have it classified as a tier 4  I believe   Uphold has quite a few coins that can t be transferred out which is super annoying since they were the first place I used for crypto i think yes  as long as you have at least 200 COPE on your sollet  you re good You mention FTX which I don t have  is the COPE I can buy through Raydium the same or some wrapped version of it  Can I just buy it through Raydium and move it to Sollet Also  delete this immediately  I can see your seed phrase I have entered all 24 phrases and input my password and the next option isn t responsive when I press  I usually get asked for password right away but this time it asked me to create new account  if someone could help it would be appreciated They do kyc The New Password field is blank You forgot taxes I m on Exodus purely based on it being the only iOS wallet with staking I could find for SOL   I d move in a heartbeat if there was a better iOS option Serum  I bought at  3 and I saw it had reached  10 within the past month   Figured it would get back up there again   Also  we need a dex on a fast exchange   Haven t used it yet but eth has a few options and I m glad sol has one now too It s incredible  It s trustless  closed log order book is completely transparent  It links to your wallet  you make the exchange  you settle and disconnect your wallet  Takes power from dudes like vlad and Brian Armstrong I haven t tried using the serum dex yet but I did buy a few of the coins on the dip and been in the green since the next day Cool  The docs on their special program library are pretty neat too A lot of people don t expect this unfortunately Oops yeah FTX too View in your timezone    tomorrow 12 GMT  0    0   https   timee io

the movie Idiocracy Yes  Stableswap right now and mercurial Finance soon https   twitter com stableswap_pro status 1399631281789472769 s 21 But the requirements to run a validator are pretty energy intensive and if this becomes a global platform  that s a lot of computing power  And who cares if it s  less than Bitcoin  that s not a reasonable argument for the same reason that bitcoiners arguing  it s less than fiat   Even YouTube or google have a huge carbon footprint and they are running just computers  What if we put a cap on the number of validators to a minimal number like 100 or something so there isn t an explosion of resource intensive computing on the network  There really is no price for the environment There s no hype around solana lol  Hype   promises  ADA is hype  Results     hype Yeah  but much  much less  to an acceptable cost Ahhh that explains a lot about what I was wandering  thank you Running a validator is like running a business  you have to have that mindset   Are you willing to market yourself  to compete for stake   Are you willing to try to add extra features to your validator  if possible  to attract stake   Are you willing to create a great website that educates people and inspires confidence in your committment to Solana   Are you willing to run at a loss for a while as you build your  business  If so  then running a validator might be for you   If you expect to just walk in and do some simple hardware building and system config work  and then see money start rolling in     you will be disappointed   It is a business model that can work  but like most business models  it takes significant investment and effort Not yet  Soon Mercurial Finace You can try it here Secret mercurial financePassword  weloveyou Agree 100 They forgot about it and moved on to adding Doge  barring any issues with liquidity    Like  get the issue with the first crypto fixed before you move on to shitcoins Don t stake on an exchange https   twitter

actual numbers yet they bother to write paragraphs What s the current approx apy for staking   FTX exchange is giving 10  for staking on the exchange We know what Solana is  If you don t want to read all that shit   SOL is the foundation a ton of proof of stake coins are being built on  It s like Etherum but without insane gas fees  And it s COOL which honestly means a lot in this market Nano is the fastest crypto  but it is meant for micro payments   So it serves only one function Solana can serve an infinite number of functions   It s like comparing fast computer to a bullet  Both can be fast  and you may prefer one depending on your needs XLM is to ETH what Nano is to SOL   If you want to compare them solely as a currency  does it really matter if the transaction happens in 1 10th or 1 100th of a second  The speed and fees of Nano are for now actually a source of  weakness   The network is vulnerable to spam attacks   They are working to fix that Nano use to be one of my favorite since it was XBR   And it s why I was immediately drawn to Solana   Maybe the two could be paired one day to form a power team   For now  almost all my stack of Nano has been traded for Solana   Still keep some Nano  it is amazing to trade  very wild price action because it s super popular in Asian market and not at all in the West It s been beaten to death From what you understand  So you haven t actually used exodus  The Epoch is 2 days and the rewards are added accordingly   tho the phone app is a little jenky but this will improve with time  And I m not  clinging  to exodus I m only saying the SolFlare is not that convenient at the moment which is probably one of the reasons why it has lower usage  I do have a laptop  but it s not as secure as the iPhone  They need an app Go to Solana com All the validators get the same APY  I don t understand why you re clinging to Exodus  You dont have a laptop  From what I understand Exodus even takes longer than 2 5 days lockup for your SOL  There s no reason it should take longer  I ve delegated hundreds of SOL and tried different staking solutions and validators its always only taken a single epoch to start getting rewards Do they have a token Isn t this basically the same thing as insider trading in stocks  How is Coinbase able to do this  especially now as a public company Wishfully thinking is not a sin What I don t understand  is that even though they re now running on Solana  their coin is still only available to buy on Uniswap  Are there plans to port it to Solana ecosystem I love Raydium Coin Gecko has a list of exchanges for SOL too Yea  that kinda pisses me off that Solana is getting delayed to the point where Doge is getting listed sooner It can outperform and underperform while being correlated with BTC too SOL fell from 58 to 19 during the recent correction and underperformed the BTC  BTC fell less than that During the recovery  SOL can outperform These are characteristics of an altcoin I think the thing to understand is that Solana is designed to be able to continually scale with improvements in hardware  So while some of the design elements aren t being used to the maximum efficiency now  the architecture of the system is such that those elements can be taken advantage of when they are needed Smart contract execution isn t a bottleneck now  but it could be eventually if we see truly huge TPS numbers  So the Sealevel runtime is designed to allow of parallel execution on CPU  and eventually onto GPUs as well when that time comes  And this can all be done without smart contract devs needed to do anything  or port to a layer 2 etc  The system scales naturally underneath them With regards to Solidity and the EVM  both of these could be ported to run on Solana  but that probably isn t as important as many people in crypto think it is  There is nothing special about Solidity EVM  and you could arguably say they are poorly designed  I don t mean that as a knock  but they were the first to do it on Ethereum  but lessons have been learned since then and there are better ways to do things Rust is an excellent language with a growing ecosystem  It s a great choice for a blockchain project Coinbase seems to have bought there bag to sell to retail in the  40s so probably waiting for a price bump before they sell it to their customers Thanks   link is above in first 1st reply To

have different types of shirts and styles  Make sure you check the product details even when selecting different color since they get their shirts from different vendors it tends to change the material  cotton vs polyester  etc  The blue shirt is an active t shirt  dry fit  for the gym with the logo on the back  The v neck is polyester cotton with logo on front for the street   you can customize this   I like the Solana store too   they just need more variety Smart contract execution isn t really a bottleneck  It s probably the fastest part of the whole system  CPUs are really fast  I O is a bottleneck though  that would affect smart contract execution speed  but you can optimize that with all kinds of tricks That leaves signature verification as the biggest bottleneck that you need to use parallelism for  hence GPUs So basically  PoH allows us to have more validators in the L1 network without slowing it down  And then Ethereum and Cardano are less decentralized because their answer to that is sharding  and not every tx is validated by every validator  Do I have that right https   store solana com Looks great This looks interesting  They could really use some documentation around the protocol though  Might have to reach out and see how easy this is to work with No idea this existed    Thank you With Dogecoin being listed tomorrow   I m hoping SOL gets listed with it tomorrow Where to buy it CU Next Thursday Comparison to Bitcoin is fair  insane  spiraling energy usage is inherent to Bitcoin s design but not Solana s  In the long run  I don t think it s feasible to power Bitcoin with 100  renewable energy  With Solana  energy usage is comparatively trivial even with significant growth of the network If Solana is too energy hungry  then we probably need to end all deep learning and pc gaming too  Doing useful things with computers  especially at scale  requires a lot of energy  We should probably ban the internet too  I don t think any website is worth the environment V1  BTCV2  EthV3  SOLVaporWare or not as good theoretically as SOL is today in reality  Eth 2 0 Layer 2 Dot  Ada  Atom Eth having the dev mind share is also way over

blindly loyal to Coinbase Refrain from using the SPL  gt  ETH bridge  I ve lost funds due to limbo and I ve seen many people have the same problem  I would just use FTX to deposit SPL USDT and trade it Scam  don t respond He s insanely convincing Neveruary I love solana Right       No one is USING ADA   Best thing ADA has going is marketing Coinbase insiders are known to buy up loads of a token they are about to list  knowing the listing usually pumps the price  They didn t predict the dump that BTC took right before the SOL listing  so they are sitting on bags they bought much higher  They want to wait until the market recovers so they can dump for profit later Sounds like you re in NY  If not  just open FTX us I am a big fan of SOL but I also like ADA and its approach  Why do you consider ADA a hype  Afaik they are still on track  roadmap   which is not something a lot of projects managed in the past  e g  IOTA Actually when I connect to my metamask the receiver address was filled automatically  that I rechecked Avalanche is better because you can send yourself tokens and receive 7x what you sent in a bonus block  Who wouldn t want to use Avalanche when it can 7x your

 staking is only beneficial In The sense of that would increase hodlers correct    so how does not selling make the price less likely to move   Idk if I framed that right but are you saying that if there wasn t staked and they were selling  some people in whatever amount   that would increase movement   Or do you mean cuz then there would be more swing trades You gotta have 3 solana Create a

pools and farms for Sol Excellent  really useful thanks I ve been using the platform for a month now  put some old beats overthere and yeah  its awesome  Could be the future of websites like soundcloud  which its run by people who doenst understand the music community in my view  Didnt know about the podcast thou  thanks Where can I get one Just buy buy buy some Solana now  It will rocket when it does get magically listed finally  I have been acquiring on Uphold myself  If you don t have an uphold account already let me know I can PM you my referral Lol my bad you re right  Got too excited It s not actually Shopify This is really unique and well built on Solana  I tried it for some time and the overall impressing is great  Waiting for those local artists to pop out and raise fame for the platform Wow this is exciting  Also  totally didn t expect Shopify to launch an NFT market What This must be a bot   And possibly the most pointless and annoying bot there is Sorry but that s not true   Validators earn  credits  by voting  so validators who have better voting records get more SOL apportioned to them and thus earn more   This is why the APY is not the same for all validators of the same commission   See stakeview app    at every commission level  there is a range of achieved APY  that range determined purely by each validator s  vote rate  Vote rate is kind of a mystery   It s not entirely clear why some validators do better than others   For example  my validator  Shinobi Systems  was at the very top for well over a month   That s why it has the best returns over the past 10 epochs and  all time    But in more recent epochs  for unknown reasons  other validators have had better vote rates It s kind of mysterious   No one knows exactly what causes it or how to improve vote rates without random variance Not sure why  I believe you You really need to post on Discord  sorry   This type of question is asked and answered all the time there   You can go to the  welcome  channel and scroll to the top  then click on the icons to assign yourself  roles  which then allows you to post I believe it s to entice people to get their coins onto the exchange  When there s more coins on the exchange  there s greater liquidity  especially in higher volume coins that people want to buy and trade on leverage Nah  just half of them  Which is already a lot No one knows My point is  commissions aside  the Solana network inflation grants rewards evenly and proportionately to validators based on stake This will be huge  And huge for Solana  Will onboard lots of new users Not too bad today  well above  32 None Source gotcha thats a good point    also Justin Sun the other accidental rug puller While I agree with you this happened when a different fraud  Justin Sun attempted to take it over Exchange staking is a threat to any POS chain and we should avoid it here Glad I could help Interesting  this wasn t on my radar  Thanks for sharing please dont mention the curse word of Dan Larimer or any of his 3 projects    the accidental rug puller here anywhere near SOL or SBF what  a  fraud This is just a demo   alpha showing that its fully working  There is alot more in the works from the COPE team including a fully functioning game built around this integration where leaderboards will persist and top scorers can earn COPE The applications for this is gonna be huge in bringing mobile gaming into the the solana ecosystem Not a mental thing  it just doesn t get aggressively traded like speculative moon coins  A lot of stakers  Recent decline has more to do with futures market wipeout  many took bets that did not consider SOL below  30 or  25  and they lost a lot of money when it did Look at a 30  60  and 90 day chart   definitely outperforms BTC  Not suggesting it will always outperform BTC  just making a point re correlation This guy fucks First of all the staking with high interest is TEMPORARY  You don t stake permanently on Binance but choose   product   of 15 45 60 days  that are quite randomly available Second  not sure we can call that staking  cause you not participating to the network  you just lending your coins to a CEX that does god knows what Edit  also the usual   staking   there has the same rates more or less  it s just a promotion to create this kind of discussion we are having right now  Might even be part of the marketing to post in each community Also they lock the fund  and it usually correlate with up and down and I guess there is a fair share of insider info about these events My personal opinion  CEX or C solutions are never better  and not your keys  not your coins Just get an account on Binance  Why not this is my research lol  but ya i got it  take everything with a grain of salt Where did you find it  is that defi staking Yeah  i agree it will be further down the road   I think that is pretty obvious   I never heard any timeline for when it would be implemented  which is why i asked u _Jay Bee_ where he was getting that it was years away   I think when it is implemented it will be seamless because the POC code already exists and is being updated daily  https   github com

Here s an excerpt The Water Clock AnalogyThe way an ancient water clock worked is that a regulated flow of water would drip into a vessel at a constant rate  Marks on the vessel and the rising level of the water would allow the ancient Greeks to record the passage of time Similarly  to record the passage of time  Solana s PoH based blockchain uses a verifiable delay function  whose output cryptographically verifies that real time has passed in the process of generating that output  i e  running the function   In this case  the blockchain s rising  levels  aren t seconds or a unit of time  but simply sequential outputs of hashed blockchain state and count  In this way  just like a water clock  you know that the lower levels or  marks   hashes  had to come before the higher levels or  marks   hashes  Rough sketch of ancient water clock  Wikipedia The specific verifiable delay function that Solana uses is a preimage resistant hash function  This is  in simple terms  a function that takes a bunch of data  the input  and spits out a small  fixed size output  For instance  a large video can be put through a preimage resistant hash function and come out the other end as 256 bits  Or a piece of string data  like the name of your favorite restaurant can be hashed into a fixed  tiny bit sized amount of data  The usefulness of these functions lies in security  No matter the given input data  there s no way to predict the exact output   you have to execute the entire function to actually know the output  this is the cryptography part of why blockchain technology works and is very hard to  hack   Given this  if we run this function in a loop  taking a previous output as an input  and do this as fast and as we can  there is no way to know exactly what the output will be  oh let s say  a million hash functions from now  If we run this with a counter and record how many times it s been looped and the current state  hash value   together these pieces of information represent the data structure that tells us time has passed  We can also  append  external data into this stream of hashes  by hashing the data together with the current state  hash   Because the PoH stream is verifiably ordered  we can then know exactly where in time any appended event and or message was inserted into the stream  So no matter how fast or how many pieces of data get recorded to the growing PoH based data structure  we know what data messages had to come before or after other  blocks  through upper and lower bounds on time  Similar to the levels in a water clock This method of  timekeeping  makes it possible for a high speed central limit order book  which Serum built on Solana https   medium com solana labs ftx chooses solana for serum a high speed non custodial decentralized derivatives exchange c346a27c1f2b exactly  with the amount of money in crypto these days  this is just coming out of the marketing department budget Getting a larger and larger

stake small volumes of all these high apy alts  It is likely boosted by binance and they are providing the  extra  apy to incentivize people to buy Look at the bottom when you press staking  On that page you wil see the unstake button  Ther is your staking amount  And then you see its more than you put in A similar thing happened a month or two back  but for 30 30  Apr  I staked for it and it was fine  but the option was gone by the time I came to stake again It s not suspect  it s just a marketing promotion they make every now and then  It s limited in the number of coins you can supply to stake  but it works well  I ve been doing it a lot with DOT  BNB and other altcoins They do it to promote their platform and give an incentive to stake  Costs them probably more money to do that but it brings people on their platform instead of others   DeFi I did some locked staking on Binance and got a very nice return  It is sus I agree though lol 34 Thank you  Confident_Holder  for voting on

SOL if you are staking for 15 days What is the APY on Binance Yeah only binance  They have  23 22  apr listed Didn t see anything for Exodus in the  select wallet  category on there Might have made a mistake using Exodus and Everstake   Staked on 5 26   It s now 6 2    still no staking rewards showing Are you only able to stake on Binance and not Binance us  There s not even an option for me to stake in binance us maybe because of borrowing and lending It definitely tracks the performance of BTC  Give some time  BTC is still trying to recover from the recent crash  Once there is a clear reversal from the short term bearish sentiment  altcoins like SOL are likely to climb faster It is Odd I agree Very good question  Need digging because it sounds suspect SOL doesn t follow BTC Try

background noise for those who want an inflation hedge Pick 1 with low fees Has anyone come across any updates  The launch seemed imminent over a week ago  and haven t heard a peep since This aged like day old milk Hi  thanks for making this app   I have a question about the APY   Currently the app shows an APY of 8 89  for the best performing validator   But the APY for Solana on stakingrewards com shows about 10 28 10 40  even if you account for 7 10  commissions The questions is why is the APY on  stakeview app  https   stakeview app  lower   Are there other variables we should be aware of that reduce the APY This is the kinda stuff that s gonna bring mass adoption of crypto  I bought some on Monday actually and very happy I did This  I ve had 66 67 sol staked for a while and I think it s only the third decimal point that has increased thus far The biggest selling point and differentiator for sol is tps  It s all about tps Hi I just did a steak on Chorus One pool but since 15 h  the status still Activating This quite strange or this normal It s still maturing and the market decided  30 32 is fair value  Expect more users after hackathon project exit beta and

focus is in the wrong spot    wasting your human vessel energy on this It is because validators need to be such beefy systems on beefy networks that the size and scope of the network of validators will always be modest  probably never more than a few thousand   At that scale  the energy usage compared to bitcoin is still absolutely miniscule could be that 22 3 with 10  apy takes more than 2

https   stakeview app what about the fact the each wallet created has to contain sol to start with   this is ok if the price is low  but what if Sol price dones a 10x or 20x over the next few years Maybe but isn t the environment more important  Plus I don t think any of these crypto projects get anywhere unless they are carbon neutral That would handicap decentralization What s the rate Having this same issue  After jumping thru loops  amp  bounds to get my Ledger connected to Solflare  seems to only work in Chrome browser  I finally got to the point of sending my   of SOL for staking   only to now be stuck waiting for  Delegate Now  to show up gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them I like the diagram but what are the names of these projects You can start off from checking the list of exchanges on CMC or coingecko where SOL is listed  For example you can buy SOL on Binance and then send it to your Solana wallet Who said solana was an Eth killer Not everything is out to kill something  things can coexist Faaaaaaaacts That s so simple and so true  It is cool af Wouldn t like this move for you How unlikely is it for Exodous to let us choose validators like Solflare So they can add decimals makes farming   calculations easier Why Will surely do Another great resource  Thank you ETH has a big valuation so all ETH killers have high valuations too Thanks   Seems like SOL has so much potential Why did xcope  gt  even come about  Is the swap to cope from xcope necessary HAPI PROTOCOL AND AML ORACLE IMPLEMENTED AS STANDARD Meaning no rug pulls   hacks or illicit funds entering the ecosystem Research  HAPI and u will see why this ido launchpad is the most secure not only on solana but in all of  Crypto Haha seems so lol all the excitement didn t

this offer a 11 62  APY Staking with a 5  commission  yet the first 160 Sol I staked were commission free and 16  APY until the end of the year  Yet I don t think they still offering that option What about Slim Shitty  clickbatty title This is another front end built on serum  Anyone can built UI Serum   backend protocol supporting defi on solanaFTX   major backer of Solana and serum development I don t think the SOL wormhole is live yet   AFAIK the only way to get SOL is through a centralized exchange right now   Binance is one example well yeah  if you read my other comment you can see that i am clearly open to the idea that i am just too dumb to understand it at this point i also have little doubts about the system working or anything  i am just missing a piece of the puzzle for it all to make sense to me and where these amazing speed gains are coming from my last status is  PoH creates a clock for the system  clocked systems communicate faster  therefore solana is fast although this makes sense i would prefer to have a deeper understanding than this For me was to deposit to ftx as that is a very good exchange once there easy to swap sol Uhhhh   okay I m honestly having a hard time believing that you  comprehend  the material you read if that is honestly your only thing to say in terms of feedback  But to each their own  Allow me to ask you then  what is it  functionality wise   that you either thoufht it was   hope it is  or misunderstood it to be   Also   you do realize the level of intellect of the creators of this protocol right  I am sure you are a smart person  but we are talking about some of the most  specifically other worldly levels of genius  with the team behind the coding and protocols Also  PoH is just a slice of the pie that makes solana chain sadly  i read this article before but it didn t give me the answers that i was looking for  maybe im just too dumb for this   D not really  i read these articles before but i watched a few interviews of the creator and at least he confirmed that PoH is indeed NOT a consensus mechanism  so it seems to be indeed intended as a system clock but im still not  clicking  with it Your post has been automatically

front end that connects to it  Bonfida  orca   mango markets are some other examples of serum dexs  Originally project serum had an implementation dex on their website but it was sparingly used compared to raydium so they closed it down BitMart is mercurial live yet Best place to ask about this is the    FTX Telegram Support Group    https   t me FTX_Official This subreddit is about Solana

because of the misleading   Title Have a look at  mercurial and stableswap Wait what about FTX   Serum You want to give abit more info or remain vague and act like you re trying to diminish the sub and spread fud Did i get it correct that nobody succeeded to order from their store  Or after 2 weeks it finally arrived with no problem The Hoodie is pretty cool Use solflare com even exodus stakes there  Once u stake delegate u see rewards every 3 days and apy is shown on solanabeach io Dad  I just want you to be proud me ‍ ️ Rug pull I thought Serum was the DEX for Solana Ok  2023 at best then Same as any other dex  impermanent loss  smart contract error etc It takes an epoch to activate then another epoch to see reward Waste of time  nothing there but people posting support tickets and invite codes  Atrocious sub Can you be more specific Everyone s expected 2022 the whole time  this isn t really that bad of news  Please don t stone me By whole time I mean the past year  fyi Can anyone explain to me what the risks are Can anyone explain what the risks are  I m struggling to find a good source for this ok  thanks for your feedback  let s wait a bit longer then Worst case to first rewards is about 6 days  one epoch to stake  one epoch to earn first rewards    Give it at least that long before worrying about it For me it only shows the updated balance in the  Staking  section but not in the wallet itself So in the wallet I only see what I deposited but when I click  Staking  it shows that amount   staking rewards I posted this yesterday but they removed my post  Moderators of this sub are strange I love listening to him and a few others    Coin Bureau   amp   Crypto Casey  to name a couple   No shilling  just here are the facts that they are aware of and you decide if it s enough for you   Here is CB    Solana update   https   www youtube com watch v PA1kA5yT1Ac James is fast becoming a legend This guys videos are great  Only YouTuber I watch for crypto analytics Texas Eth 2 0 is basically a meme rn https   tokenist com buterin explains why ethereum 2 0 upgrade wont arrive until late 2022 amp Officially  Buterin believes ETH 2 0 won t arrive till Q4 2022  This makes huge head room for Solana to grow its DeFI presence It ll still cost the same amount in Sol  A 100x in Sol price will still be under a penny Ada is hype because they don t have a beta net or even a test net  Until they do  and projects onboard  the road map is just promises  SOL also beats Ada in every metric measurable Me too   I m not exactly new to the space either so I m in no way a noob same  like did i create 2 wallets and forget to write down the seed to the one with     I m positive that isnt the case the fact the sequence is the same for all these other people is concerning  cache cleared   gt  wallet deleted   gt  seed phrase doesn t work  Doesn t seem like coincidence  I think it s a problem with the cache clearing in chrome bc my other two wallets were fine  meta mask and liquality Yeah  I was a little annoyed with the checkout process   I also never received shipping confirmation or a tracking number and it took about 2 weeks for my shirt to arrive That s cool  I want one Shits got me bugging like I have another set of words or I didn t back it up the fact the sequence is the same for a lot of other people  cache cleared  wallet deleted  which is odd bc my other wallets were fine  and not able to use seed phrase to recover wallet can t be coincidence  It s 12 simple words Pretty funny  No cart  no payment method  no mention of shipping  Don t the Solana people know someone with online merchandising expertise yeah that would be super helpful man  Like you said i m out the    anyway  I ll give it a try That s not true  there is plenty of liquidity There is at least  10m liquidity rn on Raydium LP s USDC SOL  USDT SOL Coinbase is definitely an adult in the room that has access to liquidity  to earn maker taker fees  I don t see why Coinbase or Solana would not have interest in this happening Tristan Over is actually a great host  There are some fun guests on there like Matthew Graham and Mark Cuban too Nope Nah no luck  Just silence There is a seeming question of competence if they have to mull over your worthiness for two months I did   Used a link from another chain on this where you put in your phrase as you have it   It can point out  and it did for me  which word is off   I m out now  but can give a better explanation tomorrow   I was nervous putting in my recovery phrase  but it worked and I would have been out that     anyhow if it hadn t Hard to say  Coinbase looks seems more organized than they actually are  Probably related to compliance Wow  Free Sol Seriously  I m reading a lot of instances of this  I had the exact same problem  Anyone get any help in regards to this Same  My cache cleared in chrome extension and now I m not able to get into my wallet  Did you get this resolved did you ever get this resolved  I ve had the exact same problem My cashe cleared and my sollet wallet was reset  but not like my other wallets where all I had to do was enter my password  I had to actually create a new wallet  however  when I enter my 12 word seed phrase it won t work  the  next  is still greyed out   I ve checked the spelling and capitalization and checked it against the approved BIP39 words  All matches  I ve used this seed phrase before  This has been an awful expereince  Any help or any feedback from those who ve experience this would be appreicated did you ever get this solved  I have the exact same problem Yeah I was mainly referring towards the vneck  honestly if they got a nice black cotton shirt and put some effort into the logo it would be a fire shirt fr Didn t know FTX had a podcast I actually don t think they would care  For one  you re doing the same shit Redbubble is doing and I they haven t shut them down   maybe Solana did license it s Trademark to them and that s why they re still going  Or maybe they re about to get slapped w a cease and desist   we shall see  On the other hand  Solana is bragging about 300k Twitter followers meaning that they re actively trying to grow the user base and promote so maybe they welcome people like you and Redbubble who want to advertise promote for free  I can t imagine the founders of Solana honestly giving a shit about how much Solana Merch they sell   it s all about the next generation platform Sollet Try pocket casts   also listen to the FTX podcast and Unchained Joggers for the APES Booty shorts for my girl   That would be so gas   You re onto something   amp  yeah it s clear that it a gonna be taken into my own hands  You think if I did a t shirt run Kickstarter style   the ones where you don t pay if the shirts don t get made   and I try to get like 200 printed for this sub  you think sol would get pissed or be about it   Also   fuck it Bc ima get some dumb THIC hoodies made you want me to hit u up if I do  On some lOWKEY Can you imagine    That would be crazy Yep The dry fit is not that good quality wise but the v neck actually feels like a good quality shirt Haha dude I love it  Agree with you 100  shit is cheap  But will have to get the job done until the Solana store steps it s game up  The Sol Store isn t even that expensive but I bet the quality will be better  Just need more variety  Some shorts or joggers would be sweet too Yea same here    at least they were only 20 bucks  Hopefully the Solana store gets more inventory soon I could be wrong  very happy to be proven wrong  since I am not familiar with GPGPU  But I think multi threading is far far away from able to leverage GPU efficiently to the extent that there is performance gain from switching from multi core CPU to GPU  Thus my current conclusion is  eventually onto GPUs as well when that time comes  is not a feasible path  gt  Under certain workloads  yes the branching might kill your performance but with a good JIT compiler you can make it work Happy to be proven wrong  this sounds overly optimistic These shirts are actually fire Someone should set up a merch table in Solana Beach  CA You are mistaken here  Sealevel is natively parallel  Rust is perfectly capable of multi threading  And I think you are overestimating the problems divergent branching  Under certain workloads  yes the branching might kill your performance but with a good JIT compiler you can make it work Still don t know   try Serum DEX until then Yup  Also Sollet will estimate total fees   amp  breakdown   The estimate is usually a couple cents within range of actual Just sign up for FTX  took me  5 minutes before I owned some SOL   better for us to build up our positions before it s listed everywhere else Are you using SolFlare

realize there were any  I ll totally check it out and see if anyone else is having those problems  It s pretty less than ideal especially if I plan to use SOL long term with staking and whatnot we hit 40  They should announce listing soon Sounds so troublesome  But glad you got it figured out  Have you tried reaching out to any of the telegram discords that are out there for a simpler solution I mean of course if you re happy with your workaround don t even worry about it Metamask actually worked surprisingly well once I got it to link with sollet didn t have any issues  Just the fee was more than I wanted to pay but I had to do what I had to do Also I ve heard from a bunch of people about brave I ll totally try it out sometime soon  I just feel dirty using it because I work in marketing and it goes against what info I need from people lol Yeah I had to transfer in with SOL so it was added  I ve already made a workaround with metamask  I was able to transfer my usdc to wrapped eth  but appreciate you trying to help Have u added the token first on your sollet wallet what are they waiting for   Launch this thing it only takes 2 days   just rescan and you will see the progress Yeah  they ve rebranded recently because the developers  visions are evolving  Is that not okay  Does that in itself make it illegitimate  Certainly not  They did not rebrand because of reduced gas fees  In fact  they rebranded at the  peak  of ETH gas fees  Also  it shares none of the characteristics of actual pump and dumps  Such scams are based  solely  on hype  i e   they re not actively used   have little to no work actually being done on them  and die after the initial pump  none of which is true for Polygon  Like you  I don t know what its future holds  and like all coins  holding it certainly has its risks  My opinion of its value is based mainly on the amount that it is used  the people involved in the project  and to some extent the increasing partnerships  You re welcome to think what you want  and it may indeed be over hyped right now  but calling it a pump and dump is factually inaccurate  See  straw man fallacy  https   en m wikipedia org wiki Straw_man I got the same message whats should I do    I am using my andriod smart fone Thank you for the helpMnemonic validation failed  Please enter a valid BIP 39 seed phrase Someone on here told me you cannot move your coins off there without non us kyc Solana does 50 000 transactions in a second I agree  I m not a dev so I m still learning how Solana s PoH and PoS features work together  Anatoly already said PoH isn t for consensus so that had me rethinking the whole thing  I would love a ELI5 but anyway   no point in going on the defensive vs app less chains IMO Charles is the Steve Jobs of blockchain  He s an absolute legend at selling people an idea  He s great at making tons of fantastical claims without any evidence  He s great at framing complex ideas in a way that are easy to grasp However  unlike Steve Jobs  Charles doesn t have world class developers rapidly producing products  Instead  he has a team of academics with lofty ideas  but absolutely zero ability to deliver a working project I third this TLDR Sol may not be the most secure Layer 1 blockchain on the market  But it s more secure than Cardanos non existent Layer 2 solution which is necessary to compete with other Top 50 projects  Many of which have functional technology which is already better than Cardanos proposed  and not delivered  layer 2 solutions  _____________________________________I m so sick of Charles running his mouth without producing a single working product for ADA  But let try to put my personal bias aside These claims are partially true from what I understand  However  Solana is the only blockchain to implement   proof of history   which allows blocks to be rapidly processed by validators without relying on a block time stamp  This is why you see the block times of Sol change dynamically  The transactions themselves are time stamped  allowing for operation that functions like a typical blockchain  but with much faster transaction speed There have been people who expressed concerns about the security of Solana  However  these claims are overblown IMO  They seem to frame their criticisms in framework of other technology  and they don t seem to have a firm grasp of how POH actually functions Second  Charles claims are always related to making Cardano sound better than their competitors  without providing any actual evidence that this is the case   The issue with these claims  is that ADA s plan to bring competitive TPS to Cardano is to use a layer 2 solution called  Hydra  which they have been teasing for 4 years without a single working demonstration  From all the research I ve done  I ve come to the conclusion that Cardanos layer 1 may be slightly more secure than Solana  However  there is no universe in which a Layer 2 solution is more secure than Solanas Layer 1  And the entire proposal of Cardano is to use Layer 2 scaling  So this guy really should put more time into his project  and less time attacking other projects which are actually functional They need to get an SPL supported wallet first No crypto is a  store of value   In other words it s useless  If the token coin doesn t create  a demand for itself through applications or something else  then it s a useless pet rock ponzi  Why can t Ethereum or Solana be a currency  You can send it  And you can also use it  Isn t that better than only being able to send it Probably   IMO Charles is a really smart guy and there are a lot of smart people in crypto  More importantly  it doesn t really matter if Cardano is right  wrong  whatever   it doesn t have an impact on what Solana is doing  Maybe Cardano develops something that works really well with Solana  who knows  I m not personally invested in Cardano because they are a  50B  leaderless  entity that has few finished projects to speak for that capital  and time Personally  I m ignoring anything the Cardano folks say until they have an actual product with working smart contracts  Until then  it s 3 5 years of vaporware hype I m not understanding  Solana runs confirmations in parallel doesn t it  That s the point of POH  if you are doing the confirmations in parallel you do not multiply by the amount of confirmations correct because they are concurrent You can buy SOL in  FTX us  https   FTX us   Its owned by biggest SOL supporter and backer SBF Binance us is fine  You should be able to export SOL directly to SPL supported wallet or via Binance Bridge without any issues  im not promoting binance nor am I a fan Support FTX https   Solanabeach io validators It s based on network activity so it fluctuates Indeed CRYPTO COM Wish we could get a daily thread so that there would be fewer junk posts   Not referring to this one btw Yeah nobody ever mentions gate io  So many coins on there Nice https   spl solana com token  Here  Also other helpful material to be found in SPL Solana com SOL has been mentioned today in the Financial Times article  in quite a positive way  which is probably attracting attention   Silicon Valley bets on crypto projects to disrupt finance   Solana  a new blockchain that Multicoin backed in 2019  has appreciated by a factor of more than 150 since it listed on the exchange Binance last year  giving it a market capitalisation of  9 1bn  Multicoin is the largest outside investor in the project  the two groups said  Solana claims it has faster speeds and lower transaction costs than ethereum  By the end of the year  the smartest money that s not full time crypto will be saying ethereum has not won   Samani said https   spl solana com token  check this out Yeah  I like approaching I know right  I bought my SOL Moon bag at the dip for  20  Let s go SOL Whether and how long we will have a multi chain universe is an open question  which no one should be completely confident about  Chains that seek to serve the same functions will naturally compete for users  and some of these chains will fall by the wayside over time  Just how ruthless the process of culling will be is not clear  But no one should assume that  just because a chain is useful and technically powerful  it will survive in a world populated with other chains that are useful in more or less the same ways With Exodus you need to go to staking and view your staked amount  this is where any interest you earn is shown  it doesn t actually show in your total until you unstake I believe I had a similar issue with fail to fetch errors when I was first trying to stake with solflare  After the first day I stopped getting any problems and it has been working fine since Yes  I have Not exactly what you re looking for but I hope it helpshttps   www reddit com r Kin_Cryptocurrency comments nmcckt im_excited_to_announce_a_new_series_on_my_youtube  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share MATIC is worth nothing already it s a Pump and dump they re already scrambling to change the coins purpose 3rd time again now that ETH  gas fees are being lowered Meh  If you can use KuCoin  you can use FTX or Binance  Normie exchanges like Coinbase or apps like PayPal  Robinhood are what we want  It would be nice to have that money flow from TikTok financial advisors  lol  Whatever tho  we ll grow with time Yes true  Ive had the same problem   Then i saw that the unstake value was bigger after a few days For your sake only  I hope we do because A  you probably didn t put all your money in  so a  crash  would give you time to accumulate more at a lower price  and B  price dips test conviction  if there is a dip and you re scared or you sell  you don t know what you own and shouldn t own it in the first place  Not trying to be a dick  but in crypto the price does not reflect its value  For example  DOGE is basically worth nothing  and coins like SOL  MATIC  and of course BTC  are worth much more than their current  value Will do  I may have figured it out   it requires more than the 1 2 minute delay that it displays  Everything ended up showing up within an hour of creating the staking wallet  It took another 30 minutes for delegation to also show up Doesn t seem much different than Sollet or SolFlare imo Any noteworthy pros cons regarding Phantom wallet Wait you re trying to make a new wallet that s separate from the SolFlare wallet you already have I suggest reaching out on telegram if it s urgent or wait  I m curious to learn what aspect of their consensus protocol we re seeing at work here Your funds are stored on the blockchain  not the validator itself  You would undelegate your funds and could redelegate to another validator if you wish You can stake on FTX too Great explanation Nice didn t know SOL was available on FTX US     def recommend that then FTX is great  Good people Try reaching out on telegram   discord I am not aware of any known issues We know SOLANA strong Check coin gecko for a complete list of exchanges Is this a flat rate per transaction or    How much I am trying to conclude the breakdown total fees generated per DEX swap  SRM  amp  SOL  This is good for info for anyone invested in SOL or SRM  since Solana also burns the SOL that is earned through  The functional burning is healthy tokenomics  but I do not know the specifics and would appreciate learning this It is definitely worth it to Stake Sol if you plan to HODL which you should be with a coin like Solana  They tell you that you get about 10  and some change but it comes out to more like 8   I have 80 sol and I get about  04 sol per Epoch or about 7 3 sol a year  That adds up especially as the value of Sol rises  I stake with Exodus because I like the app but you can also use Solflare but that is only online through the website I think Hopefully soon  but who knows This really should be pinned information on this sub with how much everyone  including myself  seem to encounter this Orca doesn t use serum It is 4 days sorry  Sorry  When you decide to stake your Solana  you will need to initially wait 2 epochs  where 1 epoch is roughly equivalent to two days  to start generating rewards  this means that if you start staking your SOL in epoch 100 then you will start earning rewards on the staked amount in epoch 102 Your rewards are distributed every epoch  2 days  after that Any additional SOL that you stake will also need to wait the 2 epochs to start earning rewards on that amount too US  I was just going to exchange for ETH in exodus but it tells me  not available in your state 30 days    Have they changed from 4 days to 30 days Where are you located  I was able to buy Solana via  FTX US  https   FTX US  or if you re already in crypto  via Raydium Thanks for explaining Yes  the validators with 100  fee are not open to outside delegation  And the zero percent ones are just trying to raise delegations so they can increase their margins  0  is most likely temporary  once they have enough delegators they will likely raise the fee unless they are truly altruistic  It s up to you which validator you choose  Obviously dont pick one with 100 I second this I entered the market today  I hope that I don t crash thank you FTX us You must be seeing your rewards by this time  You will be able to see your rewards when you scroll down in the staking screen in the mobile app  above  the unstaking option I m using the mobile app Thank you  I m also staking Atom and the rewards show up everyday  so that is why I was confused It s like laser eyes  but for SOL    and better because it has no limit It takes 30 days once you stake it   I stake in it  It s worth it My understanding 20  of dex fees go to the host  like bonfida  raydium  Of the remaining 80  of fees 80  of that is burned and 20  goes to serum stakers Thank you  I will  look more into Exodus as that wallet was mentioned by somebody else for being one of the better wallets out there for SOL Try Control   f5  disconnects wallet refresh  and try again Go to Solanabeach io if you re worried about it Binnace us  gate io     check Coin Gecko for more For grandpas  best technology means nothing if we don t have a strong community  Be inclusive  be nicehttps   investorplace com hypergrowthinvesting 2021 06 solana crypto avoid it in favor of ethereum for now I don t know why you got this offended  I m not telling you to get the hell of this sub and never comeback  I m just saying this post is infact a generic shitpost  It s generic because you can replace  Solana  in the title with any other coin out there and post it  It s a shitpost because  well  it honestly is   Making valuable posts in the past doesn t make this post of yours any more valuable  I don t hate you personally  I just think this post is really trashy  btw  you can check my post history  I did ask a question about how exactly proof of history worked in the past if you consider that a informative conversation Binance us will do until it s listed on a better exchange  Just be careful  they re kind of the worst  Move your Sol off the exchange as quickly as possible do an exchange via exodus wallet just what I thought  thanks for reaffirming just what I thought  thanks for reaffirming But who will transfer SOL there   ‍ ️ No  Reach out on telegram or discord for a faster better response Totally agree wormhole is live  but it looks like no one uses it   the problem is that I ended up with wWETH   no clue how to trade it I ll report it Are you using mobile app  Maybe they work differently   I use desktop computer and that s how I refresh my total each time  shortly after each epoch ends   Log out  log in  and refresh blockchain ok I read up and now know  Stakefish wtf   im down but why is this a thing  I m cracking up  ty for sharing haha How about Kucoin  I just joined Kucoin and was disappointed to find out they don t offer Solana No  but should be live soon Here is the test info Secret mercurial finance Password  weloveyou Allow me one chance to explain why I think one more app is worth you downloading DL Exodus  Its a wallet  You can swap inside it  don t need to make a new wallet  import your current seed phrase  No new passwords  no worry  amp  x200B and you couldmget SOL Get a Sollet  amp  receive ERC20 token  Sollet will give you an estimate of how much Eth you need for the transaction You will need to have Eth in your MetaMask wallet Shouldn t click on the link  most of the time it s the author of the misinformed blog trying to rake in internet traffic  He s essentially advertising  remember that no one clicks on  good  news only bad BinanceUS Fuck off     respectfully Bullish Just wait until Coinbase gets its shit together and manages to list Solana That is great    pump must go on If you already have SOL  just use the Sollet wallet bridge to send BTC to your Solana wallet  Then trade it on the dex for sol Nano has a good breakdown of network statistics available here  https   nanoticker info   https   nanoticker info    Average finality time is around 500ms at the time of this post  I m new to Solana  is there a network tracker like this for Solana  I d love to see those types of network stats in real time if it s possible Edit  Nevermind  found it myself   https   explorer solana com   https   explorer solana com   Looks like the two are somewhat comparable  both sub second   But I agree with other posters here that Nano and Solana really serve a different purpose I m having the same issue too  I have checked my 24 seed phrases for capitals and spaces they are all accurate  my phrase have no variations for example American to British  I can use the seed addresses in the trust wallet to add a Solana account but that doesn t show the balance and the wallet address is different  have asked about it on telegram and all I got is get a private key with no instructions I hope I get one more big discount day though yeah  rewards showing up now Yes You can buy sol on uphold but you can t stake it or move it on there Thanks for the tip   I have an account with Coin base with multiple crypto investments there already    I don t really want to set up another account with another exchange   I have 3 different brokers for my stock portfolio and hoping to just keep it to 1 crypto exchange   To many passwords to remember Summer is comming Low quality posts What happened to it being listed on Coinbase Pro May 24th   I d rather not put my money into Binance US This is the route I took  Unfortunately my region only allows P2P on Binance so I d be making a 7 10  loss  more expensive  if I bought with local fiat on p2p and used the Sol BNB Eth tokens to participate in Defi  Sucks Good news  Fly up THANK YOU   and I never want to be an asshole  Definitely makes me seem that way of read in the wrong tone  my response to the FUD fairies  If you re don t have something nice to say just stfu rifht   Vocalizing a downvote had to be the pettiest most adorable jab I ve ever received  But if everyone just supported everyone   to an extent of course  there is a line that I m even aware of where you can no longer say  are just having good fun  but I believe sol is a very uniquely mature community and we see things as they are  all that to say   I love your kindred spirit     Mad love         and I agree Its a great coin yeah it is just an opinion  after all  be respective  cuz it s way better being in a friendly non toxic community of a such good and promising project  There is nothing wrong just publishing positive price info   btw I think we belong even higher than now Every day the number of people simply discovering about Sol  the other coins like slim Ray and SRM inevitably lead people to SOL  I bet they look at its price history   etc Perhaps they too are aware of it hitting 200  this November        SOL Can it please flow into raydium and srm please and thank you Watch out for the  NO PRICE  JUST DOWNVOTE BC I BELIEVE IN PROJECTS   boiiissss try to get you  I m here tk say SOL 4 EVER     Let s go I appreciate your speedy response  And thanks for the award brother      How did the meta mask transfer go  Saw low eth gas fees today  So that s sauce   amp  I would suggest you download brave   it will pull in all of your chrome settings  and run chrome   with this like   second skin being Brave  It s like a naked iPhone is chrome  adding brave is using an otter box   same iPhone   but much safer now    Also it s not bulky like an otter box haha There is no doubt In My mind about this project in the slightest  that s why posting a clip of what is representative of GLORY and FAITH   because we got knocked down hard after the BTC dump  I thoufht it would be awesome to embody us at the frontlines back where we belong  All of the sudden it s  we talk about projects here ok it s not doge or GME  fucking  RETARD     Actuslly made me lol so hard at his sheer ignorance   And I m subbed to them both Bro of course you are I ended up just doing a transfer using metamask and ETH  I was on chrome no VPN or anything on  I appreciate the willingness to help though I d honestly be more hype for a Robinhood listing but CB is a good start And you re still having all these issues   May I ask are you on brave  With shields engaged perhaps We need you to keep crunching those numbers and informing everyone that you downvote that you invested in GME at the peak and sold low suppose it goes up lately with the overall market     thou maybe solpad is invloved xdxd Or get a bunch of USDC and go to raydiu  io which is the solana blockchain and you can access SOL that way too  Your new sol wallet will have a small amount when you make it  used for transaction fees   Microscopic    then you d have experience using the sol chain  As well I will tell you that it is very purchasable on A plethora of exchanges  is there a particular reason you want it on CB  In case you didn t know where to get   swap function on Exodus using eth can get you 99  dollar for dollar  time it right when eth is heavier   get more SOL   buy it with USDc T on gate io   Binance   etc Maybe you re right  but good projects attract good money in it  the question is how they handle it Take some Litecoin or Zcash to Exodus wallet you can exchange there yeah me too  so glad that I could sell it on the  50 price range  waiting for the price to go even higher Fellow ape BEYOND facts Straight up dude it s like the liberal Karen haircut   man version lmaoo your comment is a generic hate comment good lord  I spend the first part of the morning talking about tech of solana IN THIS SUB and decide to post sumn to lift people s spirits and you nazis can t handle it lmfaoooo I couldn t give  you the time of day to upset me though  it s a bit of a sad realization tho that people are truly as cynical as you lot  Smh Also   memes win every time  So when you refuse to evolve you will be left behind  Since you guys want to talk all of a sudden  I wonder if you ve ever Contributed to an informative conversation in this sub  don t recognize your names  Funny how that works Go look on my page and look at the ratio of me talking seriously about Solana vs me talking about the price  You re what makes everything so gloomy and dimsdaley  You do realize it is possible to accomplish both intellectual growth amongst the community and a team spirit   Also if reddit is your main source of your blockchain education then   people that comment shit like you is such a holier than thou move  No fucking shit it s not doge  What else would you like to inform me on  Ffs any reason for the gains What the fuck  ‍    This is me  not giving a fuck about you while we choose to have some fun once in a while Jesus Christ bro  ️ ️ ️ ️ Deposit to FTX and convert it But def try to support FTX Look at the exchanges on Coin Gecko  There are many It s basically liquidity for the exchange while being called staking right it s coming chill Lose a bit in fees but can buy Bitcoin on exodus using Apple Pay then exchange for Solana  I know this doesn t solve your issue but gets you into the Solana ecosystem  Easily transfer these funds to your sollet   phantom wallet this is just the beginning I got this image from https   www coinparticle com sadly I watched it at  25 where I wanted to invest but SOL was not listed on Coinbase then Coinbase has to make their money too once it goes over  40 plus we will see it on CB pro YEAH Here is what I used   It was designed for ETH wallets  but the seed phrase methodology is the same   Essentially there are only a certain number of words that can be used and this looks through the library of possibilities and compares then to your seed phrase   Good luck https   3rditeration github io mnemonic recovery src index html Sollet io  https   Sollet io  and its extension Ill give this a try Sry I couldn t figure out how to add a pic  It s not solana I m talking ab it s actually a rlly small cap coin called milf finance lmao We need mods to keep each mod focused I honestly had the same thought  We goin The more it pumps before the listing the better There s so many gatekeepers of what s a good post or not on Reddit  just go make a post about it and chill I m so glad I bought that huge dip This post isn t a social community post  It s just a generic shill shitpost safemoon got waaay too many votes Yeah  i can see that as well  Doesn t make sense https   www reddit com r solana comments m8oucm how_to_buy_serum_in_the_us  utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf I donno if exodus  has access to serum yet  Interacting with the serum DEX changed the way I view decentralization  I d be sure to check it out I have a sol wallet on exodus Ok grandpa  Memes and videos are a way of life for these younger generations  the biggest projects are the best  Nope  the most social communities are the biggest  how welcoming Serum DEX after setting up a Sol wallet NOT Coinbase pro thx  will check as soon as i can The latest epoch just ended  so maybe if you check you ll see your rewards No  Not on CB Pro yet  It appears that the CB wallet address is open to except migration but not yet trading Downvoting  The title  the price focus  We are not Doge army or GME  And I m subbed to both of them  But here we try to focus in an actual project Thanks I ve DCA d  60 in SOL everyday for two weeks now  prices were FTX US  https   ftx us  a 5288980  is the best in my humble opinion This sub is thirsty as hell for a Coinbase listing Thanks I don t think so Blockfolio   powered by FTX BULLISH  INDEEED   lt 3 my point with all of this info is  it is FUCKING INSANE how unique and alien level   complex this blockchain is  every single stone  not left unturned   amp  x200B imagine when they have the einsteins of the world that find out and want to come build on it  to join all the einsteins already working on SOL apps    the developers and software engineers froth over how fucking genius the possibilities are     amp  x200B oh and none of this is financial advice    i like the coin  lt 3 SIMD instructions allow for a single piece of code to execute over multiple data streams  This means that Sealevel can execute an additional optimization  which is unique to Solana design   Sort all the instructions by program ID   Run the same Program over all accounts concurrently  amp  x200B The CUDA architecture is built around a scalable array of multithreaded Streaming Multiprocessors  SMs   When a CUDA program on the host CPU invokes a kernel grid  the blocks of the grid are enumerated and distributed to multiprocessors with available execution capacity There are 8 key innovations that make the Solana network possible   Proof of History  POH    a clock before consensus   Tower BFT   a PoH optimized version of PBFT   Turbine   a block propagation protocol   Gulf Stream   Mempool less transaction forwarding protocol   Sealevel   Parallel smart contracts run time   Pipelining   a Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization  Cloudbreak   Horizontally Scaled Accounts Database  and  Archivers   Distributed ledger store Dude ill be straight up  there are certain things in life where our desire to comprehend it has the potential to be the vehicle in which prevents us from doing just that Solana is a NEW form of DAPPS   might be why it isnt making sense full to you on the decentralized factor from article  Solana is the most performant permissionless blockchain in the world  On current iterations of the Solana Testnet  a network of 200 physically distinct nodes supports a sustained throughput of more than 50 000 transactions per second when running with GPUs  amp  x200B Achieving as such requires the implementation of several optimizations and new technologies  and the result is a breakthrough in network capacity that signals a new phase in blockchain development USDC means  in theory  you can go to circle  give them a USDC token and get back a dollar   WBTC means the same but you d go to the wBTC company  give them a wBTC and get back a bitcoin    In reality  these companies  and Tether  will not directly honor their promises  they tell you to  sell  the token to someone else  If USDC traded at too much below USD  then circle can buy them back at a discount and make a profit In both cases you re trusting that these companies don t get hacked  sued or shutdown  There s not way to get your asset back if they do Sorry but this doesn t make sense  Solana doesn t exist in void  other projects will affect it and it will affect other projects specially when we are talking about it s direct competitors so just removing posts because they mentioned another project doesn t make sense
2021-06-04,39.58130434,39.60986377,34.31090061,I hold sol and harmony one I would say this is  SOL specific  SOLANA is basically FTX s official blockchain network tps  lt  2000 though Cant forget about ALGO as well they ve been making lots of crazy leaps too almost 49 000 Talk to me about interoperability though Dunder Mifflin  a division of Sabre  is working very hard to add Solana as an accepted form of payment  We are your business  one stop shop for paper and printer needs Love it  I m so obsessed with SOL  truly the future of blockchain with only layer 1 solution  I invest 1070 SOL since January  I wish I can upload my screenshot here I must have the wrong seed phrases because I tried it every way I could  Such is life  Expensive lesson  Thanks for the ideas everyone How does this impact the circulating supply  How does this impact the token release schedule  I don t like how in the dark the Solana team leaves us Appreciate it  Many Thanks If you re going 0  commission  why melea   There are 4 zero percent commission validators with better performance than melea Article mentioned that they received previous  series A  funding which is VC funding  usually for shares  but it might be for tokens Is there an erc20 bridge Everstake has much closer to average returns   So they are decent  nothing special  from a returns perspective   My problem with them is that a  they misrepresent their APY  claiming I think 13  returns on their website  and b  they are oversized already  with 13  million stake   There are many options with better returns that are better for the network too Why isn t it launching on Coinbase yet   Been pending for weeks https   imgur com a DDm4OUu  https   imgur com a DDm4OUu Fair point  I also use Coinbase and it saves me a lot of fees this way Yeah I m a long term holder for all my coins   not a pump and dump person The only reason i want it to hurry and lost in coinbase is because that s what i use to buy all my cryptos   i use Blockfolio only for buying solana  I look forward to being able to purchase everything on one platform Here s a good start for answers to alot of questions you may have https   github com agjell sol tutorials blob master solana validator faq md Challenging Eth   For real  aren t you going to need to raise like 40Billion to do that  Not 400Mil whoopsie  good catch   It was way to early for me to be typing Solana is a unique project  No matters if it s listed on CB or not  Hold and Trust is every thing to do I use Everstake  what do you think of this validator Lol good man So you ve seen at least 3 people ask about Coinbase then It works for me  1  Try and make sure you ve got the latest ledger firmware    2  sure ledger live isn t running  3  Use Chrome based browsers  Brave counts   not Firefox  And try Solflare com That s a lot of Sol  I m jealous Site https   staratlas com updates Its legit  Source https   www coindesk com solana launches 20m fund to advance ecosystem in korea I have a bag of  SOL and today I looked at the coinlist funding rounds  Since they raised money at such a low price  it does make me wonder if I went in too high i made a post a week ago about about problem with ledger and sol flare on firefox i tried a few things and gave up  i just used google chrome and it worked perfectly try google chrome Woah woah woah slow down there Jethro  Doge supports all coins equally Also just to be fair   i did upvote your comment lol https   docs solana com running validator validator reqs Hey fucktard  if it bothers you that when people ask questions   i suggest you get the fuck off of a forum website  Go trip on your dads dick and have a good day    also I ve only been on this sol forum for maybe 3 days now Not to be a Dick but   are you aware they have a website Goddamn   5 is Bomb  You gonna be even happier when it hits 250 5 Diamond Steak House vs Black Angus vs Chuk E Cheese s party dinner Lil analogy for ya bud YouTube also this cool video platform I heard about recently   has answers to your question as well Why you being defiant It s very easy to romanticize and froth over  That said  I choose to continue to learn as much as I can on it  invest  and pray to God we get our big break and chance to show the world what s possible w this tech  Also I live near Solana beach  she s beautiful  On fridays I watch the sunset w her  as I DCA In     Jk bout the last part but SOLANA is goat I hate to be that guy but why the fuck is this asked every single day     Who gives af    Are you not able to get it in the other plethora of methods   Or you are expecting it to pump   Or you were incapable of reading any of the other posts identical to this   Or you have never been on reddit before And this was the pop the cherry of dumb question   Sorry hehe just saturated with  when coinbase My guess is USDC refers to the one on Ethereum and WUSDC is the one to use if you re withdrawing to Solana Just to be sure  try pasting your Solana address under USDC and see if it brings up an error message  If it does  then WUSDC is the one to go for You are wrong  Wow  Incredible level of ignorance Thought it was interesting that they leave that part out  Assume it s a raise via a sale of Solana tokens Don t count on a huge boost them  See SOL as a long term investment  I am really pleased with all they do Nope  It s wallet supports it but i cannot purchase it   i have pro same  love adding to my position at a discount as well this is the way need some t shirts ASAP hopefully not for awhile so we can continue to build up our positions while it s on sale I would ask Coinbase So pointless but thanks Do it  But how Lol Pretty sure Solana is already on Coinbase pro a few weeks ago One thing I am curious about is that Vitalik says between zkrollups and sharding that ETH2 will scale to about 100k tps  With SOL maxing at 60k  will they need to integrate an L2 to stay competitive  I do think the SOL code being written in Rust will attract some great developers away from ETH regardless wtf yES I still have an email that it was listen on coinbase pro  so I suspect it was removed  But I might be wrong then Looks like an ad for Metaplex Defi is for the masses  not just the nerds  This too should be pushed that you don t need high level skills to participate    just a tolerance for volatility So what happened with that Eth you got Accordinging to https   solanabeach io validators they charge an 8  fee  You can try melea which is 0   Be careful when slashing is implemented though Leave both password fields blank  Your old password will remain the same  I ve found this is the typical problem with a lot of restoration issues  Can seem confusing Yeah you should check the maximum  and mininum  amount that can be staked first Yeah you should check the maximum  and mininum  amount that can be staked first Once on Coinbase   incorporating Hapi and Boca Chica launchpad for security   it will blow all other blockchains out of the water   More secure   faster   cheaper and released before ADA or DOT    least a first mover advantage It s very reasonable But still admiration  Gonna buy a cap shirt  mug or something DApp s are still relatively new  so it ll be a while before we get an nft market that can connect to a decentralized wallet over an app  Some wallets don t even have

Thank you for sharing No  I m not in discord  I think it raises in popularity because it has just been added in atomic wallet r usernamechecksout Use chrome zkRollups are more secure than Solana L1

looks good and for now https   youtu be xaILTs _1z4 Speak for yourself lol  I ve bought every single weekend Sunday dip so far l   f   g It s savage out there   My pay was going somewhere else but SOL hit that 40  was waiting to see if it could take 42 but I m in   Ets eaking o What browser are you using  In Chrome for example a 2nd chrome window will come up to approve the transaction  did you get this window Not sure if you already have a specific charity for this project  but if not  Effective Altruism is a good resource for picking the most high impact charities    https   funds effectivealtruism org I really don t think so  We were talking about a specific coin  not the crypto space  and they gave specific reasons why they thought it would dump  not that it has dumped Binance Yes  Tried on my cpu  phone  and tablet  I must have made a mistake if it s not a global issue  My loss How about projects built on SOL like Raydium Have u tried using the sollet browser extension and see if it works Good idea I believe he meant figuratively   the crypto space pumped and is subsequently dumping it  ofc not a literal sense Edit   rhis is just my interpretation Give it one more shot with Phantom  if you have it   or any other SOL wallet that you can restore with those Seed Words in it  If failed  then my friend  the Seed Words have something wrong with them  if succeeded to restore  report it in  sollet channel as they told you in the  faq  there is nothing else can be done  Good luck It should have already been listed  Due to some  technical difficulties   it s delayed I tried on Mathwallet  It didn t work under Solana Thanks for posting  Your explanation of 0  fees makes sense  I also like that you re only focused on Solana and your website description that you have a spare server  Now I feel comfortable staking part of my sol with Shinobi Systems  I ll look into others like GenesysGo  This is new and exciting stuff that  25 is crap  You have to stake  400 into crypto com s token to get  25  I used a friend s referral  they told me ahead of time  and confirmed what he told me  I d rather not have it sit there throwing off my portfolio total when that money isn t actually accessible to me I won t feel bored trying to help you  that s for sure  it s my pleasure actually I don t wanna sound pushy  but have you really tried restoring wallet somewhere else like the FAQ says or not  Were you successful restoring your wallet there  Phantom  Trustwallet  or Solflare  with your seed words that worked fine before  That s an important step just to know your seed words are 100  correct  amp  nothing changed in them My bad   I am using Raydium   I got the big yellow banner on Serum   I m an idiot Serumswap was deprecatedIt s says in a bright yellow banner above it Use raydium I read all that and appreciate you trying to help  I just want to see if others are having an issue being logged out automatically and if their seedphrases aren t working I was referred to the FAQs which I had already read through You said they didn t reply back in   Serum Discord   sollet   channel Make sure to remove any extra space bar  before or after the seed words Every seed word is separated with 1 single space bar only  you ll have to double check your seed words again  use another browser  amp  let us know the result Choose    Mainnet Beta Backup     as a change before restoring your wallet https   imgur com dTwT5Ni How are the fees  Exodus is easy  but their fees are ridiculous Anyone with a brain that has viewed him speak can relate him to a bonafide cult leader  Him and Cardano were a giant red flag to me when I heard him speak years ago  Constantly spewing bizarre influential metaphors and analogy s  In less than a year Solana has gone from nothing to a huge library of disruptive dapps for finance and much much more  The people involved in the Solana ecosystem are competitive builders LFG I moved mine off there  I live in US  Had to do kyc once my portfolio got so massive  I think it was 1k  Dunno if this answers your question   Without non us  is a whole double negative situation so it s confusing to me now after a 12 hr shift I am having the same issue as well  All my words are BIP39 and you have to re enter when you set up the wallet  I want to know 1  why I got logged out 2  why it won t work 3  why none of the devs on discord or telegram will interact with me except to say to refer to FAQs Are you the same person who just asked this same question on Discord Well anyway I ll bridge my answer to here then The effective APY is a complex topic  because there is inflation  and because there are actually two ways of talking about APY  and people usually mix them or don t even realize that there are two Basically  the inflation rate reported by the Solana tooling  and used in technical documents describing Solana inflation  is not a human timescale rate Instead  it is a rate measured by epochs  which have variable length in human terms   Epochs always have the same length in network terms   they are always 432 000 slots   but in human terms  the amount of time that an epoch takes is variable Because of this  the current inflation rate of 7 73        solana inflation    Inflation Governor     Initial rate              8 00     Terminal rate             1 50     Rate reduction per year  15 00       Rate reduction is derived using the target slot time in genesis config        Inflation for Epoch 188     Total rate                7 73     Staking rate              7 73     Foundation rate           0 00 Is NOT anything that you should use to calculate any actual returns   In fact this command used to call these numbers  APR  I believe  but this was misleading and I asked them to change it  and they did  to just  rate    Which doesn t really help to make the difference clearer  but at least it isn t outright wrong Anyway  I would like to call this  EAPR     Epoch Annual Percentage RateThis is the inflation rate over 182 5 epochs  which if epochs were actually taking the 2 days they were planned to  would be the same as a human scale  APR   since an  Epoch Year  and a  Human Year  would take the same amount of time But that is not the case   epochs are taking around 3 days right now   Over the past 51 days they have averaged 2 days 20 hours 24 minutes Therefore  an  Epoch Year  is actually taking 1 425  Human Years   at least  if the average of the past 51 days holds    it could get slower or faster as epochs get slower or faster That means that the 7 73  EAPR is actually spread over 1 425 human years  making the inflation rate actually 5 424  APR OK so inflation is currently 5 424  APR   But returns as reported by solanabeach  the solana command line  the block explorer  and stakeview app    are in APR terms already  because they are measured over a human timespan  the actual duration of epochs  That means that for example  the top validator over the past 51 days is 8 81  APY against 5 424  inflation  for an effective APY of 3 386    Note now that I ve switched to APY  which includes compounding of stake rewards  which I think is reasonable since stake rewards do compound The  median  validator is around 7 68  APY over that same timespan  for an effective APY of 2 256  OK now having established all that  it s obviously not possible for the same returns when the inflation schedule in 10 years has pushed inflation down to 1 5    Returns would have to be lower than that So     to finally answer the original question  in 5 or 10 years  staking rewards will definitely be lower than they are now due to the reduction in inflation over that time Of course     it s always possible for inflation to be re upped through software changes  and if the community decides that is better and the larger community of investors accept it     then it could happen   But that s just speculation   At the current documented plan of record  inflation reduces to 1 5  in about 10 years Finally  in the very long term when Solana is at 1 5  inflation  there may be some increase in effective APY of staking due to the transaction fee burn    if there are enough transactions happening by that point  and I certainly hope that in 10 years Solana is at 50 000  TPS   then transaction fee burn will reduce effective inflation while not changing staking rewards  and who knows  maybe the combined effect will elevate effective staking rewards to where they are now  or even higher No parallelism increases throughput  transactions per second   this is latency when the day comes  you will lose conviction and chicken out  thats how fear and greed work I use blockfolio Same and thank you Is there anyway to get an output like you see in the explorer  tx from address to address and amount Thank you for this  Maybe this is not what I m looking for  I m trying to make some kind of call to get details of transaction like you see in the explorer  tx from address to address amount and fee  Is there anyway to get this output So solana is a corporation   How do they expect revenue other than SOL token this is one of the most expense ways you can do an exchange Lets you buy right away  Can t transfer it out of the exchange for 10 12 days though Use your seedphrase and restore into Trust wallet gt na seems to be a copycat of ETH2  not a real competitor  Read its whitepaper and a few classical crypto blockI bird in the hand no sir  mine is very reasonable NEO was my big win in 2017  SOL is my big win in 2021  I have it rivaling my ETH position right now  When you start interacting with and transacting on the SOL chain   you understand the hype  Most of my yield farming is being done on the SOL network too using Raydium Solfarm  which is much easier to use than the metamask insert swap here method  I bought my first SOL around  5 but I m still bullish as all hell Solana seems to be a copycat of ETH2  not a real competitor  Read its whitepaper and a few classical crypto blockchain research books paper PhD theses  you will understand what I am saying I read the entire whitepaper of Solana  It seems to me that it is essentially a PoS system with some kind of throughput  speed  optimization  PoH almost has nothing to do with the consensus algorithm  there are many PoS systems having very high throughput without PoH   Is Solana a kind of ETH2 copycat I don t think that s true  You can t buy Solana yet on coinbase  Only wallet is active  No trading allowed Crypto is right now an asset category  and there s no such thing as real diversification in crypto  Crypto assets tend to rise and fall together  Bitcoin is by far the largest  so it will tend to rise and fall less than others because it takes more money to move BTC than it does to move any other crypto asset So when things are climbing  a good project like Solana will tend to rise more than BTC  but it s also more likely to fall more as well when things are going south Unlike with traditional financial instruments  like stocks  if you invest in the whole crypto market you re very likely to get absolutely destroyed  unlike say investing in every stock in the US market  which is very likely going to beat any strategy you can come up with just look at my name lolz agreed  remember    main enemy is wall street and tradfi who have been ripping 99  of the world off I wasn t degrading anything  Literally I said  this is great news for Solana   You can infer negative sentiment if you want  but that wasn t my intent Use Gate io I usually obtain tether on an exchange like kucoin or coinbase pro for example then transfer to gate io and it s pretty straight forward from there Bad reporting Have the same issue here like many other   This happened after the chrome update hopefully ledger and solana working on something to fix things soon Wait  What  When Seriously lol Privileged child  What bothers him all comes out Hi everyone I am starting to research Solana Sorry if this question annoy some of you but what is the differences between Solana vs ETH vs ICP and I know most of you are biased but how would you rate the potential of these projects Cheers guys this Check out Star Atlas   They re building on Solana I actually liked the  ets eaking o Ngl I don t like content like this  ETH and SOL can will probably co exist  There is no need to degrade one project to prove yours is better  The future is multichain This is the way Also noticed those moments in which I was most scared to put in extra made me the most Defi nerds are stronger together   but also totally separate and autonomous Indeed Tribalism in crypto needs to end Solana currently interoperable with Ethereum   I m not sure how Ethereum could benefit Solana  but there are more devs on Ethereum I m bullish on both Coinbase pro has it too Ftx us or Blockfolio mobile app I fully believe in ETH and SOL  Plenty of time still and plenty room for both thats awesome man  but yeah it sure has  i was a little late  and tried to avoid creating a new account on another exchange just to purchase SOL  but glad i did with  FTX US  https   FTX US     wish they would verify quicker and early credit a higher dollar amount process ACH deposits quicker Vitalik is friend  not foe I think just 1 coin or something like that  Doesn t take much to start one  it s how you run it out yourself out there that matters  If you start staking you ll realize what attributes make a good validator  I will say  staking with smaller validators helps build our network If you build a computer to run a validator do you also have to have a certain amount you stake as well Coinbase owns them and that s how I have heard of them  Bison has brand name recognition if you will  That s probably why  I tend to pick validators that I am familiar with  see how it works with them and if it doesn t then I change  I def don t want to leave 1  or 1 5  on the table  so I ll be switching to some of your suggestions up there Came here to say this  Almost like listening to a drunk person talk  Aside from that really on point 6 5     SOL has moved up a lot this year Validators vote  people that stake with them give them the power to vote  I think votes happen pretty often and on regular schedule   Could be wrong about this  still pretty new   There are pretty hefty hardware requirements to run a validator  but could be profitable if you run it professionally  Personally I m stashing coins to try and raise funds to build one Bad reporting  Solana did not say they were raising  300 450m to  challenge Ethereum Why not Thank you for this wonderful post  This explains a lot  I will move my stake from Bison  I think the bigger issue here is the epoch length and if it is a growing pains issue  I think that s ok  I am sure they will figure it out over time I couldn t figure out where the approve was  I had too many windows open and I was finally able to locate the window with the wallet to approve  Man do I feel like an idiot Hi  I m sorry to tell you that you did not pick one of the better performing validators   Bison Trails has had mediocre performance for a very long time   Over the past 39 days they have an APY of 7 17   which is ranked 452nd out of 603 validators   In fact  if you don t include the 100  commission validators  which aren t really staking options anyway  Bison Trails is 452nd out of 519 Bison Trails is  easily  the worst returning  large  validator  by a long shot   They also have poor network performance characteristics  i e  skipped slots and voting latencies    Really I just can t fathom why people stake with Bison Trails   They managed to grow their stake from 7m to 7 6m over this month of horrendous performance To NFT    it is always the answer This is a great buy believe me  You don t want to miss out Will they be able to coexist What does that really mean gt terprise applicI think Solana shouldn t be compare with Eth I understand it as a separate blockchain  Over time projects will build better interoperability between chains like Solana to ethereum but they are distinct Please correct me if wrong This was very much expected  Terra and Solana have plenty of time to grow into juggernauts while ETH gets its shit together But the funding is slow and doesn t let s you buy until 11 12th day Did U press approve in sollet It s not a scam  It was developed by solana  There is a support wormhole page on solanas discord From what I m reading  the wrapped wormhole eth isn t traded anywhere yet  but you can send it back through the wormhole to get your ETH back They need to put better disclaimers on the site props to you though for such a healthy position in SOL  i am jealous  whats your avg cost coin a little choppy and riddled with errors  however i applaud whoever is putting information out there for the benefit of solana   well done Will solana eventually act as a side chain to ethereum Did an AI write this  It is awful writing desperately in need of an editing pass Yup   same shit different bathroom Well let s just say I ve seen this post way too many times on this thread  This is crypto   people seriously that uptight about a few percentage points here or there  Give me a break lol But maybe some dexes are Yes  that s it  https   solfarm io vaults Hi You can use  stakeview app  https   stakeview app  to see the acutal staking rewards and hence make your investment equations accordingly Thanks a lot  I had been using Radium for all my Solana swapping  this is really helpful Thank you Yeah I figured it out with them  It is the right site  The exchanges just aren t listing the wrapped tokens yet Are you paid the staking rewards in SOL or in BNB One more price to pay for the slightly higher yield is that FTX unstaking takes 7 days compared to real unstaking which is 3 4 epochs Bison Trails Hey I m not sure because I ve not come across that URL before  If you go to the solana discord  there are high IQ guys there that can help you  https   discordapp com invite pquxPsq Hey  its 5 90 as of this post  You can swap it on openserum here  https   openserum ch dex   market 8GufnKq7YnXKhnB3WNhgy5PzU9uvHbaaRrZWQK6ixPxW Which validator are you staking with interesting but the spelling mistakes make it hard to read  a pity because the information is solid Bit of an aggressive tone there for no apparent reason  I m with op  high interest rates are clearly been used to fish people in when actual rates are only just over half of what s advertised  The integrity of crypto and its various founders is debatable  black market goods and money laundering are about all its been used for right now   Op is well within his rights to be questioning I don t have this issue with other protocols  My understanding is that an epoch is 3 days instead of 2 5 days and that is why this is happening right now  The question really is why are epochs taking longer than advertised and whether that will be corrected  Things need to be properly advertised because that s how I make investment decisions  The annual staking rewards is part of the investment equation  Solana advertises 9 10  staking rewards  but they are more like 5 6 Dude  just be happy with what you have  You and a buncha other folks on here keep complaining that it s not as advertised   so what   It s a wayy better return than you would find at bank  Nobody  not SolFlare  not Exodus  or any of these other staking apps are hitting their numbers and a lot of this has to with inflation which is not stagnant  You have 2900   SOL for crying out loud which is about 10x what I have so like I said  be happy with what you HAVE and don t become a greedy prick Solana is a great crypto but not all coin can be found in one exchange  theres a lot of gem on kucoin you can buy  you just need to explore it  Maybe in near time they will list Sol too Definitely worth the hype  Interacting with Serum DEX changed the way I see the future of trade Thanks   That s the issue So much advertising I ve seen for megaplex   just like Shopify etc   I went to the website   there s no app Is this a typical market hype before actually building something play Check coingecko where it is valued and states it can be exchanged on Serum DEX They fooled me    lesson learned I had that issue in the beginning but haven t seen it since  It went away with time I guess they  fooled  me to send some SOL back to Binance to get that apy   been withdrawing a lot of SOL from Binance lately Uphold Are they trolling us It may be true depending on how you measure the level of decentralization  If the level of decentralization is measure by the degree of permissionless then Cardano node can be run on cheaper hardware  Rasberry pile  whereas the barrier to entry for Solana is much higher software spec to maintain TPS  Not sure if this counted as  network resource s requirement  above or not    All in all  it is not a matter of being the most centralized and permissionless but achieves an optimal balance for each use case Error 410  NOT FOUND It is simple  since Binance already have some SOL surplus that they kept as reserve staking  probably a large portion    they just sacrifice some earning to use as extra incentive to attract new customer For example solana currently has an inflation rate of 10 percent whereas bitcoin and nano have zero  For store of value you might say that you require provable scarcity or at least some form of governance on the inflation rate for example  something like decred does Yeah so the block containing your transaction is produced after 400ms  But just like bitcoin for safety u might have to wait until a few block are produced after your block to make sure that the transaction is irreversible  hence the term  confirmations   In BTC blockchain the miners alwas pick the longest chain  So just to be sure you are on the longest chain you wait a bit until a few more block are added  The same holds for solana but its a bit more complicated  But I shared the link which explains it  Although I admit I don t understand it too well either  There are some blockchais where one confirmation is enough  For example nano or avalanche  Because they have a different protocol for consensus  https   help coinbase com en coinbase trading and funding sending or

Great summary which confirms my own research  Time to stock up some more SOL Try this older thread https   www reddit com r solana comments nqlu0b staking_sol_on_binance_apy_much_higher_than Go check the discord  There s a ton of stuff on there that ll help you  It s easier than you think I didn t use dumped past tense  Clearly not disagreeing w you Took the last 15 coins available to stake for this Good to know they re functioning as intended Emoji overuse is very irritating They are losing money with this but they do it to bring in customers  BTW those short term high APY positions has max amount limit  and usually it is very low  and you can not stake a lot of coins You are welcome  and if you ever have any specific questions about staking or Solana in general  don t hesitate to ask   Wherever you stake  best wishes You can also check on step finance I completely agree  I have also compared Charles to a cult leader in the past  Solana is absolutely a disruptive technology  and I m excited to be apart of the project I fourth this  ftx us is freakin awesome
2021-06-05,37.41737934,42.82267205,37.09911074,you need to download the solana command line tools  there you can request SOL on the test net  PM me if you still need help what happened to SOL on coinbasepro They have insnae fees  similar to coinbase    i am looking for information on the trusted platforms above  not some scammy company that misadvertises its bitcoin  credit card I didn t see a SOL USDT  only a SOL USD   I ll look again    thanks for the response Debut this bad boy at  200 for maximum salt I am unfamiliar with the differences between binance us and  regular  Binance  but try to find the SOL USDT pair and then you can purchase directly with USDT instead of converting first This will still count towards your total amount of SOL EDIT  typos Seems too early  we are just getting started So in that line of thinking   ETH 2 is a copycat of any other POS system   You re so thick  It s mind boggling  POH is not for consensus  it allows for each validator to not rely on separate clocks and therefore increasing the speed of consensus itself  Why are you so fucking hung up on this   Goddamn man  the autism really struck your OCD and obsessing over aspects that in it if themselves don t fucking matter to be spending your time worrying about  For Instsnce  your obsession with proof of stake being the type of consensus that your imaginary eth 2 uses  Let s say they hypothetically were tk use the same exact consensus method   now what  They re diffeeent blockchains dude find something constructive to debate wow I hold bch  it s great  but don t think it s as fast and you need sol to run the apps I believe   I honestly don t know much about smart bch   Will it still depend on mining   Anyways  no one system can be everything and shouldn t be     could lead to issues of security   Just my thoughts I also think we may just be correcting from flying up to  58 about a week or so ago   So hopefully we will rise back up there   If we so hit  50 again  I think alot more peeps might fomo in I like  COPE  The founder legit develops features  the community is live and the idea integrating with Twitter has viral potential  Its also very cheap at around  2 rn I m unfamiliar with Helium  but I assume you need to pool tokens together to hit the amount required to stake  I assume you want to have a smart contract make sure that the rewards are split equally back to you and your friends  Its normally best to build dApps on the native blockchain  so do you know if Helium has smart contracts Next cycle   for sure When opening a FTX account in US must you have a utility bill etc to verify your identity  I only have PO Box  Trying to purchase Sol  Thank you 1 Nano X sometimes cannot connect to web wallets using the Windows operating system  This is likely to affect any browser based wallets that use WebUSB  The Ledger team is working to resolve this     https   docs solana com wallet guide ledger live What happened to Sol s listing on coinbase  It was there the other day Yeah idk wht you re talking about i can buy right away Please explain Exodus  but fees are expensive  You can also try binance using just the basic kyc verification which asks for pretty much nothing Exodus Wallet Over the next month or two  there will be a flood of tokens to choose from as the hackathon ends  I think there s still a lot of building and just holding SOL for now may be the best move Do you know any good place to see fee difference between coinbase  binance  ftx and blockfolio Its quite expensive for people not denominated in usd to get funds on blockfolio  at least for me   I take almost a 6  cut off the top just to get it on the platform  thats not including any fees they hide in the spread or withdrawls fees Great shirt idea It can be inspect on Google It s 15 I feel you Samo The government I mean Shhhh they are listening Is there some mobile app which allows to interact with raydium  solape etc   Or it is best to use sollet Thanks   I didn t realize that about kin   Just thought it was a Kik thing   Will look into those apps   Really hoping to see a stormx type coin on solana soon too fingers crossed   Like that concept but running on eth too expensive You do understand that in almost every case  the old mantra is true  Buy the rumor  sell the news  You should not expect SOL to increase significantly after the CB listing Rather once it s announced  there will be a run up in price until it s listed and then people will liquidate  Driving the price down It works both ways  if it s listed it gets that much easier to cash our for a lot of people Take a look at KIN  used by many app users  in KIK  Madlipz  Rave  Perfect365 and many more  Most used crypto in consumer apps  It moved to Sol in december and they have moved 40million wallets  so it s the token with most wallets by far on the sol blockchain Delayed coinbase listing effect https   solana com ecosystem samo Which list is that  Pretty sure it s missing a few coins cause SOL is like rank 15 but still impressive price action Yeah  we re getting to that point  Good call finaly it s a scam    lost 400   amp  x200B it was a very good scam build like a real solana project    they exit scam There are def a lot of factors  Few that I can think of  I think a lot more people are finding out about SOL  there was a new testnet release too  Besides ICP  SOL is the least known crypto in the top 30  so I wouldn t be surprised if the price keeps rising even if BTC crashes  That is  we have the least number of social media followers  people talking about it  etc  My experience from the crypto bull market is that after a bit BTC price stays stable  and people start looking at other projects to invest in  and altcoins with potential start slowly going up  such as SOL  NEO  etc gt olanas out of thin air via dilution  The foundation has 35 percent of its sols locked up fohm so based off of that it states the foundation has 10  of the tokens     Assuming they give away 2 5  of total tokens  25  of foundation controlled tokens  for  450mm that s a post money token valuation of 18bn  Right now its trading at  20bn  Seems fair Been using CoinEx Staking is also now available on the mobile version  I just updated my wallet and was excited to see the staking function i used to get an error message because of my IP  im in NY  but now i can access ftx us and its giving me the option to deposit  im too scared tho haha  would also love to know if anyone had any success  would love to get my hands on some solana Use your older version of Chrome that used to work fine with your Ledger Nano X u atomicwallet just rolled out staking in ther mobile  I stake most of my assets there and will be staking sol soon  Will keep you posted Hey  anybody knows why the price has been ripping this week What in the fuck is samo Sixted  Would be nice to have a place to hang out here I would love to do that  but Team Finland plays ice hockey   World champ games  I see some crypto ads  things are moving My average is like  41 sol and  5 50 srm and ray  Starting buying Sol at  57  It will be back there soon an to  100 soon imo  Just start buying now daily for like 2 weeks or something  I did mine in 3 chunks and only bought at  30 and didn t get any  19 I have finally logged back in guys  I did it through a desktop chrome browser  input the seed phrases then confirm password  in my case the next turned blue when I removed password  Good luck You seem pretty butthurt lol Your legit going on and on and not saying anything Having the same issue  Firefox works better than Chrome but still experiencing bugs  eg Ledger doesn t allow to confirm transactions on Solflare Coinex Locked or unlocked SOL that already exists and will remain locked or unlocked after the sale  thus affecting neither overall supply nor circulating supply   Just a change in ownership of the tokens Plz They could take the  Welcome to Solana  pinned thread and condense the formatting a little bit  then just have that info at the top of the Daily Weekly thread Fifthed Reminds me of Windows vs alternatives back in the day   There were many things better but once Windows got a certain critical mass vs other OS s no one cared about its flaws   It was  good enough  so to speak Fourthed Hell yeah  this would be great Thirded Why is solana not following rest of market Raydium  and serum i guess Seconded This will not affect total supply but it might affect circulating supply  Its not a stock where you can just conjure solanas out of thin air via dilution  The foundation has 35 percent of its sols locked up for the purpose of  development   If we assume they raised 500M At 20 dollars it would be 5 percent of the sol supply  Which to me seems suspiciously big  Therefore I doubt the validity of this article  Maybe they raised 100 200M  That would make more sense and more aligned with previous fundraisers I don t understand why people say they are a black box when it comes to tokenomics when there is a perfectly complete list if all the details https   research binance com en projects solana Fucking memecoins my god Isn t that a massive no no with the SEC  How many Sol does Solana own  Quite confused If ETH2 had already launched or ETH was already PoS  Solana would still have some advantages but probably not nearly enough to overcome the first mover advantage  But since that is not the case Solana had has time to build a chain that will be competitive along side ETH and have advantages in certain applications   If ETH2 ever works or launches  And if it doesn t then Solana could become the most used blockchain The volatility will go away once more money comes and the market as a whole grows Soon dancing on the moon with yall and SBF  Sol Serum Hapi That is the  current  tps it doesn t mean it doesn t support 50k tps  It shows the network is underutilized and it can support  roughly speaking  25x many more transactions from here Yes it is exactly PoS with mechanisms that make it the fastest PoS  It has the same consensus mechanism as the theoretical blockchain ETH2 has  No point in any technical comparison until ETH2 is a working product  Until then I will argue that Solanas biggest advantage over ETH2 is that it has already launched I ve noticed huge dumps after coinbase listings too  be careful Needs to happen imo  Top 10 status is deserved with all that Solana is doing currently  Solana has to be growing at a faster rate than 99  of other blockchains  I see Solana as the premier trading block chain in the coming years  If it s true you can run an actual stock exchange on this blockchain it might eventually become the alpha in the end  Jmo  not a financial advisor  do not listen to me  but please buy Sol lol No just China banning cryptos then backing vechan    as eth killer  why is everything a killer now  Why can t we all just exist and acknowledge the fact we are all here to make money Solana belongs in the top 10  Make it so Funny math  15 is a much lower number than it looks This sentence is obviously not a technical argument  The core of any blockchain technology is its consensus algorithm  Solana s consensus is essentially PoS  which is identical to ETH2  Algorand  XRP  el tal The Solana founder s presentation does not provide any information newer than his whitepaper did  its PoH is superior  My technical training  certainly one of the most reputable  and understanding is that PoH does not contribute to its consensus algorithm  its PoS does  which is the same as ETH2

which is why you were able to directly send non wrapped USDC to your Sollet wallet Idk man staking not bad if it s extra cash I buy low and hold anyways so on that drop it would been a good buy I d wait for the right time I simply chose the first 0  one  I m quite low iq  Btw are you measuring performance by slot success rate This is awesome I agree I haven t done this with Solana yet  but I don t think you can add BTC directly as they are  separate chains  just like you cannot add BTC directly to the Ethereum blockchain   which is where the  wrapped  part comes in  So  I think you might have to swap BTC for SOL  or solana token  and then transfer to Sollet  and then swap back to WBTC  wrapped on Solana  if you really want BTC on the solana chain Accepted almost everywhere globally  come again sir Thank you WilfredCoinfomania and f10006005   I tried transferring USDC from FTX to the deposit address of  USD Coin  USDC   of Sollet wallet and  yes  it was successful   though I still don t know in what situation I should withdraw to the address of  Wrapped USDC  Sollet   WUSDC    wallet    But I have another question  sorry   I want to transfer a small amount of BTC to my Sollet  just because I want to diversify some of my tradings into defi protocol  e g  Serum and Raydium   However  I can only find  Wrapped bitcoin  Sollet  BTC  but cannot find  BTC   see screen capture in the imgur link   Imgur  https   i imgur com ZZyT9Nv jpg   My question is   1  whether BTC in FTX can be transferred to the deposit address of  Wrapped bitcoin  Sollet  BTC    2  why there are two kinds of USDC in Sollet  ie   USD Coin  USDC   or  Wrapped USDC  Sollet   WUSDC    while there is only one kind of BTC  ie  Wrapped bitcoin  Sollet  BTC    Thank you A lot of people have trouble with restoration  It s probably something very minor like caps lock or a second space between two words Which YouTube video platform Technically  one product is working now while the other might work sometime  or it might not  or it might take too long before it starts working Waking up to see Solana back over my  39 buy in     I might have to grab some Polygon today This is a good take on it  from Managing Partner of Multicoin  one of the largest crypto investment firms  https   multicoin capital 2021 05 25 technical scalability creates social scalability Chromium 91 disabled U2F integration for Brave and Chrome  Switch to Firefox until those wallets update to WebUSB HAHAHAHA  you edited your comment to throw some ad homonym  So unless everyone is licking the balls of Solana  it s fud No bro  I heard ETH is better than SOL  Go investigate You re calling me shortsighted  yet you don t seem to have the slightest clue what you are talking about  Part of the expense comes from the surge of adoption and demand from defi  It s absolutely not from  inefficiency   There is a delicate balance of decentralization vs tx speed  Vitalik goes into detail on this on a podcast I can t remember which one  Basically on one end of the spectrum you can have the fastest tx speed running on one delegated node  centralized  and on the other end you can have every person on the planet having a stake and validating transactions and be slow af while being the most decentralized network on the planet  It really comes down to philosophical differences in PoS and DPoS  You think you figured out something that  the smartest minds developing ETH hasn t figure out about  efficiency   LMAO  We are in the infancy of crypto   yet we already have  old tech   I guess once you realized the massive hole in your argument  you had to find a way to justify saying the SOL is the future and it s futureproof  LMAO again I do agree that in 10 years perhaps 2 in the top 10 will still be there  Just look at Coinmarketcap from 8 9 years ago  A majority of the top 10 have failed  With that said  I d put my money on BTC and ETH if we re looking 10 years ahead  Maybe SOL will be there  maybe not but at this point ETH dwarfs SOL in developers  development  partnerships  adoption  investment  etc  Until SOL can even begin to fill the gap and start a trajectory where this looks like it can flip  you can t be so confident in saying ETH is old tech and SOL is the new hotness  Premature ejaculation I m not here to shill anything  I have over 500 SOL staking on Solflare  I ve got some RAY on Solfarm as well  That doesn t mean I can t remain objective and assess the big picture  I don t get butthurt over comments that may challenge echochambers of thought I m literally repeating what crypto experts and devs are saying  Chill the fuck out and I m not here to write a book about the challenges of sharding in crypto  You can investigate that yourself I m sorry  but was there a problem tho   You made a vapid comment making unsubstantiated claims  and I simply called you out  I think the problem is on your end But how does Solana compare to SmartBCH  Isnt SmartBCH just as good if not better than Solana since at the very end of the day  the Solana token itself is essentially worthless  While BCH is literally digital cash accepted almost everywhere globally and also a layer 1 scaling consensus mechanism like Solana So your argument is that SOL is better because it s new     and you don t think once it s fully scaled out  it won t need upgrades while it s running  What exactly is going to happen  Are they planning on having maintenance downtime or something  The fact that ETH is able to upgrade the airplane while it s in flight is an engineering marvel  and so to use it as a disadvantage is puzzling What exactly did tech do to bitcoin  Last time I checked  it s still the most trusted  decentralized  liquid  market cap dominant crypto with the most trading pairs by orders of magnitude  There is also considerable amount of decentralization that newer blockchains will be unable to attain that legacy blockchains like BTC and ETH were able to accomplish in its nascent form So ETH is now old news  and SOL is now the new hotness  So then I guess by that measure  SOL should becomes old news by 2022 and we ll all just move on to the next hyped coin that promises they are faster than SOL  and on and on year after year There are other factors like network effects and technology entrenchment to consider  After standardized interconnection layers get built on core tech  such as ETH   consumer systems that have been using it become dependent on it  TCP IP is  old tech  and we are still married to it  The new higher layers get replaced and upgraded  but the core tech remains Also worth noting  yes I am not the creator or One of the many incredibly talented developers behind this  but sure as hell  neither are you  so why not hear from the EXACT brain who can answer your question  You  that  stubborn   IDK What school forgot to implement common sense into your learnings but they skipped past a few fundamental social cues that are making you quite the displeasing individual What s your problem Where is your technical argument It s taking everything in me to not load up a paragraph of clown emojis and crying laughing  which would only fuel your massive ego and brand me as a dumbass  so instead I will politely counter all of that with  DO your homework I assigned you and watch the entire video  From the horses mouth   afterwards  you will see why you have been so confused  Blessings  Glad you found SOL Respond to my lengthy comment in the other thread  I ll meet you over there where you can keep deflecting It is obvious that you don t have much education from a reputable technical program  Synchronous Byzantine consensus is a well studied subject  see e g   MIT PhD Thesis Efficient and Egalitarian Consensus 2017   The so called proof of history  PoH  appears to be trying to achieve that synchronous goal  Solana white paper admits that its consensus algorithm is indeed PoS  which is the key to achieving the consensus  Its PoH does not have much to do with the consensus algorithm  even though it does help a little  The MIT blockchain Algorand  using randomized election  and ETH2 achieve similar results by using similar PoS consensus algorithms Left out the part about working while its running  Its a matter of time until eth gets done to it what it did to bitcoin  Tech moves fast  As someone that has seen  the next big thing  come and go  it is easily expendable for the new hotness  Never get married to old tech  Crypto IS tech Please present your technical argument Yes you are right  I read more into it  Apparently validators are incentivized just by the fact that they hold nano to validate the chain  So big holders will run a node  And the inflation is zero Let s go The year is 2022  and Sol is finally on Coinbase Pro  I can finally buy Sol at the price of  2500 1  ETH 2 is never coming out   2  SOL is better because  reasons  I heard Should we wait until ETH 2 comes out to conclude you re full of shit  or just conclude it now based on your comment On coinmarketcap  Because there on the 15th place not 11 Baby steps my friend   Rome wasn t built in a day Bulls got their hands in nearly everything and they don t scare me  I am in for long term  Eventually BTC will loose its grip  not against it  I do have some involvement in BTC  but Solana proves to be a better investment for me at this stage  It s not a trap  every few days we get good news about Sol getting new partnership LETS GET IT BABY The app is on https   github com metaplex foundation metaplex and you would need to setup and host it yourself They should come up with documentation in the following days weeks There s still no automatic and hosted metaplex solution Btc has a huge infrastructure  It s the most secure crypto and has huge mining network It s the king  Solana obviously has some bulls paying it some attention right now but once they ve got their fill they ll leave it  Same happened to dot  cardano and many others Don t fall into the trap of Solana can stand on its own  Unless it gets real world use  Which it doesn t    Yet Noice Glad I loaded up during the dip lol I dunno why everyone sucks off coinbase  their fees are so much higher and any coin they list is available elsewhere long before it s on their platform Yield farming is    complicated  The general setup that I know  a small amount  about is liquidity provider farming  although there are other methods I think this is the most common  This involves providing two tokens  like SOL and RAY  into a pool on a DEX  like Raydium  to support trading between that pair  For your trouble  you get an LP token that represents your contributed portion for each token  which you can stake and get rewards from the fees associated with that pair  There are additional risks involved with this  like impermanent loss and DEX attacks failure  but they have a lot more rewards  The rewards are generally in the form of the DEXs token  so there s also a risk of that price dropping This should explain it better   https   defiprime com defi yield farming  https   defiprime com defi yield farming Solana has the same systems as Ethereum as far as I know Long and short Staking like through Exodus is easier and safer but with less rewards  You re also helping Solana by securing the protocol  Set it and forget it Yield farming is more risky and more time consuming  but with higher rewards  You re helping Solana by providing liquidity to make sure people can trade tokens  Much like farming  you need to water and take care of your crops Great to see the solana    hapi partnership in full swing  Amazing things ahead for both Every passing day  I regret not buying enough Sol Sol was doing this consistently until the big correction couple weeks ago  Hopefully we just found our way back to that finally  SolSzn back on for real Go both of them  go It s interesting  These 2 are my 2 favourite projects  I expect them both being top 10 in less than 3 months So I just want to see them both increasing it s ranking over the rest SolSzn back on bro  let s get it Thanks  I take your 2 cents    As investing goes  end game for all of us to make money  regardless the project has a tech behind it or a meme With good project we invest for long term and with meme to make more money and invest in good product Still does not explain why everything following Bitcoin price I still don t understand what it s for may be largely due to most ppl jumping into crypto sphere now is after the money  not the tech itself  This goes both way  one is the increase in awareness and acceptance in crypto which is good  but the other is the motivation behind it is mainly abt profit which can be bad for meaningful growth of the tech  but yea jus my 2 cents Did you solve the issue  I m having an issue in Brave where it gives me  Failed to sign with Ledger device  U2F DEVICE _INELIGIBLE   It works fine in firefox but I can t create a staking account there Sometimes I don t get it  everything is based upon block chain and yes Bitcoin being first but why all the projects follow Bitcoin price Ah  But my point stands  The cost to build the attraction is unrelated to the attendees  capital Very positive thing to see  Always believe in decent project such as Solana  the value shldnt be determined by BTC as a marker I like the comment  but I can t get over shortening at to    I will  updownvote you I have also same problem SOL is the best L1 consensus mechanism for tackling the blockchain trilemma and it does so with a novel proof of history mechanism ensconced in a robust tech stack I was gonna comment this exact same thing  Good eye  I think it has potential to uncorrelate  entirely with the help of FTX  Blockfolio About 3 weeks ago at  19  Lol  Well I don t want you to FOMO in  But  I believe in Solana because of its fundamental  I don t know if we will get chances to buy as cheap as now He s retarded just like his parents  Leave him b Eth 2 never coming out  They have huge challenges by sharding   It s also been described as working on a car while it s running  Just go for Solana  Listen to the Solana podcast they go into everything if you can understand it Yup  this is what solana is still missing  MORE Publicity  And this one is pretty good  helps alot to get the bulls HAPI and its partnership with Solana with Bocachica is gonna melt some faces Coinbase is waiting for the market to stabilize  people arnt going to invest big while it s in chaos   That s why they same day did doge  to get some quick money Think they are referring to the 40 some billion dollars of capital on the ethereum network  not market cap It s getting better enough to stand by itself   disattach from Bitcoin It s here now HAPI is a low cap gem  Once in lifetime opportunity with this one I see man  that really is something to consider  Super bullish on SOL too  Best of luck to you Image deleted Well  imo I think that the fact Solana is a new blockchain can bring a lot of new people to the network  Either that d be investors  users or developers    cuz You know    Potentials    I would also say that apps built on Solana are going to be what differs it from Ethereum 2 0  It s like a gaming platform  you don t go to epic games to play steam games even though they are all games ya know  They are different platforms providing different games and entertainment but both perfectly co exist  We are yet to see how good eth 2 0 is going to be as well  is it really going to live up to the expectations    The main diferencial from both platforms today is that Solana is here right now  it s ready  it scales and it is cheap to use    This is why we see fantastic projects like Star Atlas already being built on top of it  I m biased tho and I can t deny it  I absolutely love Solana So you can t stake using trust wallet Yeah  Don t worry im not looking for financial advise  just prompting discussion   Im bullish on SOL like crazy  so locking up in SLIM isnt much to me  But im concerned about the overall crypto cycle  cause if it dies while we re in lockup  we can kiss our SLIM all goodbye   But judging from the backlash  the lockup will be quite underutilised and xSLIM circulation numbers low  So the risk might be worth it wow  its not like I was rounding up 0 0026 to for simplicity sake      Actually  solana has 7 74000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000  inflation amp  x200B ALSO  if you going to point out such minut details  maybe you should have looked a bit deeper to find that the slot isnt actually 400ms  but 384ms Yup Haven t heard bro  Yeah I also think that locking for a year is a bit of an extreme move  Good luck with whatever you decide tho Yeah its been an experience for sure  Once I found the wallet approve screen I was surprised by the amount of addresses and information that was included in the transaction approval  Metamask hides so much information for an easy to use interface  I like that I can see all this information and learn more about transactions and how they work on Solana No  You raise money to add value through development  This in turn demands price  Market cap is unrelated to this number They just find their way into my wallet now     Good man  Blessings Just one source but here you go  Good to DYOR beyond this https   youtu be PA1kA5yT1Ac https   youtu be hya_GsSf9FETexture for your brain my good sir You are so wrong it s unreal but I m gonna pretend your not trolling and take you seriously  Use that big ol melon and soak in this info  that s your Homework mr bid  Report back  I ll be expecting you Lol I definitely think it s heading that way  I remember watching my ANS turn into NEO and just blowing up  I think we ll see a similar trend relatively soon with SOL  I unfortunately waited longer than necessary to invest in SBF coins but now that I am   I can t stop buying them lol i bought a mug  wakes me up in the morning and tells me how good the world is Faster  cheaper  more scalable the next coming years  Moore Law  Although it s still in it s first year and couple months from launching  it proved to be an astonishing solution for crypto so far Because what do you think they re selling to raise that money   P All of it  Your attempt at boasting this high level of intellect citing white papers and how nothing is tickling your fancy to think there is any innovation going on is next level cringe  If you re so fucking smart why don t you go off and make your own blockchain or even better go invest in the one that you 1000000  know is the  bees knees  considering you know these white papers and protocols like the back of your hand Or how about sol isn t an eth competitor because it s not a competition  Both in the comical sense that it wouldn t be fair to put Kobe Bryant vs a cripple  but also Bc they re playing different sports  To help you with your false understanding  or  misunderstanding  of how proof of history comes into play in conjunction with their own method of pos  go ahead and watch this video  you clearly could use the whole thing but I went ahead and found the spot where it explains like you re 5 how the whole system works Might I add  please leave your ego at the door next time  people who are this type of Einstein that develop systems such as this  don t do so ina  Whim   the way you re on some  hmm it s jus a copy cat lolz nothing innovative here ya pls tell me why I m wrong https   youtu be hya_GsSf9FEGet some popcorn  amp  a notebook  Around 9 min he starts w the conception  of poh Yes  but some people are asking so they can get some  as coinbase might be the only exchange they re signed up with WEN BINANCE nope just gave up  the support in solana doesnt give any help Can t wait for the launch of Boca Chica  Grab some HAPI while it s affordable  It won t last long at current prices What s the best buying price Well it s a chance to accumulate more isnt it  Once it s got listed  we reap Def want to see a SOL x ONE pool eventually  Gonna be the future The force is strong with this one Solana is an outstanding project  I ll keep buying and hodling Haha  random use of never ending story  But I support it because of the movie s connection to my childhood Can t forget to apply  SRM when under the  SOL Is it less secure though  I hold SOL too but only ever heard of the advantages over other chains and never the shortfalls  We re not better in every way are we You are saying something that already exists is a copycat of something that does not yet exist keep visiting the website but nothing for cretaors to get going yet  i ll keep watching Wormhole yes Please present your argument Synchronous Byzantine consensus is a well studied subject and there is not any innovation proposed in Solana  so called proof of history  PoH   see  e g   MIT PhD thesis  Efficient and Egalitarian Consensus  2017  Distributed Computing by Kshemkalyani and Singal  Chap 14  Fault Tolerant Systems by Koren and Krishna  As admitted in its white paper  Solana uses PoS  which essentially a copycat of ETH2 Why would it affect either Tell me which part of my comment is wrong  Present your argument USDC  The wrapped version seems to be used when its interacting with various platforms ie  Staking     Anyway its a 1 1 conversion  So no worries So HYPE Stupid post because tribalism needs to stop in crypto  downvoted   fuck the fud https   sonar watch Sonarwatch s  Tracking Tool  has a wrong link SOL scales in line with hardware improvements in GPU etc  Moores Law Lmao
2021-06-06,39.74912492,43.37719402,38.96399696,cool sunglasses It s a competitor to Ethereum I edited my response because I realized I was arguing with a weirdo that didnt deserve a proper response  Your gambling as much as I am  Get over yourself First of all  since tokens are not equity  i e  a claim to company profit   it is not ideal for to comparing the two  As such comparing the market cap of a company to the market cap of a coin is not ideal  Frankly speaking  we do not know what a token actually is  Althoght  we do know what it is not  However  a distinct characteristic of a token is that you can transfer it to another party in a permitionless fashion unlike real estate and stock  As a result  it can be used as a medium of exchange   Now on valuation  Personally I think tokens can be categorized based on their function   If a token is akin to  a currency such as USD  then It value come from utility  the larger the community the more valuable it is since it can be exchanged for wider range of products services  The best example of this is probably dodge coin  This might be a testament of the concept of Myth outlined in Yural s book Sapiens  All  I can do for this type of coin is trying to track the demand and number of user   Altermatively  a token can be consider as a store of value  To my understanding  a store of value is a class of asset that is uncorrelate with other asset classes  Stock and Bond  and perferably have limited supply  Bitcoin is an example of this and personally the investment function for it is as a diversifier  In any case  a store of value need community adoption and in order to do that it need to go through boom and bust cycle to naturally distribute from the early adopter to the mass  this is important because community can only be built if people feel tied to it and their skin in the game   Third  the platform like ETH SOL ADA    Take Solana for example  since the final form of DEFI is to replace the banking system  and if the produce offering is vastly superior to the existing financial system  therefore  in theory the value of DEFI as a whole should be at least as large as current counterpart it replace  As for platform that facilitate those Dapps  eventually an equilibrium have to be reached regarding the appropriate return for building on a platform  otherwise  the Dapps  profit will be unrealistically high   Currently  the only way for a platform to monetize is from transaction fee but in the future other form of monetization could be introduced such as Pegged Token swap  Dapps need to hold a certain   of token in SOL  like Strategic partner   Lastly  what is obvious to me is that a lot of projects are presently overvalue and many of the projects will have to die out   Oh  another point on platform token  for this type of token there is an additional risk factor in trusting the developer team because clearly  to win it has to keep on evolving and the community is unlikely to be able to the protocol forward Was playing around swapping coins to see how smooth it worked  as well as fees etc   well  You get a swap function that only Solana could provide  Light speed  cents on the dollar for fees  and no sketchy vibes    blessings   This is a crZy efficient way to get SOL now and USDC   visa verse etc Were you going to respond my friend Love seeing people talking about EGLD Exactly and it s around 8 5 btw  Anyone picking cherries over 2     ‍ ️ that s their ordeal The entirety of the reason for my response was that you didn t give that detail and information by saying  it s NOT 10   No big deal just trying to keep people aware of how sensitive prospective new members of this blockchain could be to misinformation  in general Edit  you continued on a different comment   I didn t see it  Case of how it s dangerous to leave a one liner Apologies maybe fud wasn t the right term   but it is bad business for SOL as a whole when you leave out the rest of the information  Should say  exodus is not 10   it is actually ___  What you did prior isn t helpful to anyone and is alarming Imagine someone asks what time it is and someone says 9pm and you re like  it is NOT 9pm  and walk awayThey re scared shitless thinking oh my god how far from 9 could it be   Instead you politely go  it s not 9  it s actusy a quarter to 8 I m on a Mac  using Brave and a Ledger Nano X with the latest version of everything   I m getting the same errors as you when trying to stake I am interested to talk about your idea   send me à message   I am a full stack dev No you didn t That is why I have hard time to justify the valuation of Ethereum as well on the long run Don t really care even if it isn t 10   I m holding Solana for long term  earning any yield is just a plus and I already am using Exodus don t feel like moving it elsewhere This is not stock  This is like buying yens with a twist  This is like buying the currency of a country that is going to have a exponential growth but can t expand the monetary base of the economy  You should calculating the total volume of transactions that Solana can have in the future  the money speed  not sure if this is the name in English   taking in consideration the staking rewards and the inflation  Furthermore  there will be an extra holding for reserve of value  Yes  fees will be part of the equation but not the most important right now Technically that s the price  not the value   Price is what you pay  Value is what you get     Warren Buffet omg Perfect  I just changed python to python3 and it worked in my linux vm  Thank you so much  I wouldn t have known where to find this  I will promptly send someone to suck your dick  Thank you Look on Twitter  buddy  Anatoly Btw  it s not like eth miner will just hold all their collected fees  They will sell it back to market so all the transaction actually push the price down What makes ETH price surge is adoption  so amount of active accounts is a much better metrics than ETH fees Simple answer  Andy and Bill s law  what Andy giveth  Bill taketh away  Every time Intel double up processor resources  new software will just become more complex and taketh away Same will happen to Solana  currently it s max TPS sitting around 50k  but soon DAPPS will take it all away  So in the end of the day  I m betting SOL transaction count per day will be 1000x and all your current calculation will not matter FUD   What are you talking about   Exodus does not pay 10   it s very simple   No FUD there   If Exodus paid 10  it would be the best returns on Solana by a long shot   But in actuality Exodus has middling returns   The difference is important  unless you think that misrepresenting returns doesn t matter And this is all in response to the original question  How does 8  compare to most other current options    So someone is asking for specific detailed and accurate information  and you re calling the specific and accurate information that answers their question  FUD I think SOL  SRM  RAY  and SLIM are all beauties to DCA for now  Sort of in that list of prirotiy as well  ofc SOL being bae  As someone else mentioned  the coming weeks will have a ton of amazingness in terms of new coins when the hackathon is over yeah just pointless when these pussies are behind their keyboard and hunt for shit to spatter FUD and downvote  But you re right  F em  lt 3 best of luck to you  Im sure SOL has a wonderful bunch of devs that will find and help you Should have asterisks around your FUD next time   and be more specific when you re talking about a percent or two difference two do differences in blocks and epochs LMAO  you were butthurt enough to edit your entire comment out  I guess the realization that you don t know shit will do that What do I have to be butthurt about  The fact that a few of the immature sciolists on the Solana subreddit only welcomes circlejerk  and downvotes anyone who brings a dose of reality Forgive my ignorance but    is  sol s transaction fee designed to be  10 per million That s what fees are  currently  but assuming that s static seems dangerous  The sol documentation says fees are based on network congestion  are subject to change  and lists plans for future fee implementation  If growth means more transactions  and  higher fees per transaction  that changes your calculation a lot Also if there was a target  why would it be a dollar target rather than one measured in SOL It was just reported on the  ledger reddit  https   www reddit com r ledgerwallet comments ntdk3p fyi_multiple_wallets_stopped_working_with_ledger Transaction in Solana consists of one or more instructions  Each instruction is a call to a program  Program is either built in program or a custom

gonna hate     _ ツ  _ Yes correct about pooling  Probably need some vote mechanism to unstake and return each of our stakes   Helium does not have smart contract  only multisig   However I think there is helium pair for SOL in serum or ftx Perfect blend of style and schadenfreude Win Those numbers are based on current SOL fees  but these can and likely will change  IMO  Governance is centralized presently  but that will change Oh good to know I m not crazy  I just got the X and have the most recent firmware installed  Hope there s a fix soon On the S  are you on firmware 2 0 0 Still waiting Agree Nice analysis  I think all crypto have a  digital gold  aspect to them  Sure gold has practical uses  used in electronics  etc  but that doesn t explain its valuation  So very hard to value compared to a purely revenue generating asset like a stock And be sure to do your math on the returns so that you can see for yourself that Exodus  returns are not 10 Jesus Christ 8  sounds achievable  unlike the exaggerations of e g  Exodus   A good quality 5  commission Solana validator pays out around 8   so 8  sounds like a number I can believe Exodus does NOT pay 10 Why does eth have value to me as a holder of eth just because some miner somewhere is going to collect fees on it  by the way  I don t actually hold eth This sub has a good amount of lames  Why tf are you downvoting someone that is being helpful  Honest to god   it doesn t force you to go buy it  The person who wanted to know how  know does  Get a grip and instead of being downvote cancer why not propose an argument or  an opinion   Need your downvote button taken away like little 3rd graders lmaoEdit  I m referencing Op s link to a comment gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them Ah lol That SpunkyDred is a very stupid and very annoying bot that just says  But you can still compare them  anytime anyone says the  apples to oranges  phrase   I hope that whoever runs it gets a rash A cancel order is still a transaction   Unless you don t want to be able to cancel orders because  it s not a real transaction Here more background https   sinoglobalcap medium com why we are bullish on solana c2be784cfdf6 overall a good read I might be wrong but I don t think that the earnings  gt valuation model holds true for most crypto For example  AFAIK bitcoin fees go to the miners  not to the BTC holders  Might be the same with ETH  idk with all the EIP1559  etc  not an expert   So if you hold BTC you won t see any of the  profits   fees   This is different from holding stocks in which valuation is supposed to be related to earnings  ahem  meme stocks   I think in the case of crypto  valuation is more related to other things such as governance  usability  and of course speculation In the case of Solana  I think there are a lot of potential and current use cases that would require you to use SOL  and that is where most of the valuation comes from Having a similar problem I think I remember seeing someone else with the same complaint I think you can see it on the  unstake  button you ll see it s a different balance amount than what it shows on the main balance Thank you Above revenue   The value of SOL is set by supply and demand  paying for fees using SOL is just one source of demand  staking SOL to secure the network is another one  Just holding SOL because you think other people will hold SOL  is another one  the more Solana grows  the more people will want to hold SOL almost surely  The value of something is whatever people are willing to pay for it  Everything else is just smoke and mirrors Nah man crypto doesnt have  revenue   Solana is a platform  Thats what it is  Not a cash generating business  it is sort of like a piece of software  Get it  A service gt  apples to orangesBut you can still compare them I have mine staked on exodus  but I haven t seen any rewards  How do you see them Im doing 70  sol staked on solflare and 30  ray srm lp compounding with solfarm raydium  monthly dca buys from usd   gt  usdc ftx us   gt  sol srm ray on Raydium  Everything is setup on a ledger You re doing God s work  I can t wait for Phantom to be an option on every Solana dapp I always assume  60  from the top depending on market conditions  Across the board   coins  amp  tokens alike You re 10  on Exodus Lol thanks for the clarification Solana don t need nobody Your a fuckin idiot Transaction fees will increase over time as the rewards for staking decrease by 15  each year Wtf when did solana get a dog coin I m all in If you could sell it for it then you can buy it with it  ThHats called  a trading pair  It can t work one sided Right  but adoption doesn t equate to a high token valuation  Adoption and valuation are correlated  but it s a flat slope in Solana s case  so to speak Reading this thread and seeing all of the downvotes without anyone leaving an actual counter or argument or debate to the comment they re downvoting is so fucking cringe  Like really  How about you add to the discussion if you re so wise as to disagree with these passive and informative claims  Goddamn  As far as OP  this is good speculation  But you have tk remember that the amount of things being built on here and that sol will be needed for transactions as the fuel  how much will Sol be worth when the stock markets and visa and MasterCard sre running on the blockchain  The sky is the limit my friend You just said you needed Sol  Case in point I think it is important to be realistic rather than idealistic  Most Eth supporters that ive come across have weak understanding of eth  Came across an Eth supporter once and he kept talking about eth advantages and all i did was asked if he used the ethereum blockchain ever  he said no  enough said  For anyone using the ethereum blockchain over the years will know that eth has gone from bad to worse  This is because the tech cannot innovate faster than the adoption rate  which is the reality of things  Think about it  ethereum at 4k usd was over 500bil mcap  Yet it was ultra expensive to send tx so it literally cannot do what it is meant to do  Ever come across half a trillion mcap company that is not functional  Nobody dare to move their stuff around in uniswap  expensive fees  Will eth2 0 seriously make enough changes to overcome the adoption rate or just delay the inevitable  Remember  ethereum needed to be much faster and cheaper years ago  not years into the future I mean  require  it in terms that these are all built on the SOL infrastructure  They could have picked something else and there s advantages and disadvantages to each blockchain I didn t read your response because I don t need to  It s going up  May go down correct a shit ton of times but the general trend is up  Screw the fundamentals lol Hopefully this clears the air for some of the people who  are triggered by PoH  or can t wrap their heads around it  Been seeing a lot of Eth 2 comparisons and random angles of arguments that hold zero weight such as Toting   sol conSensus Is buT iTSs POs THouGh  PoH iS MaKe NO SENse  SOLANA SZN BABY   Summer SOLSTICE is upon us I mean  I get it  Crypto runs on NGUs  But people are going to figure out how to properly value these eventually  maybe not for another 10 years or whatever   and you don t want to be the one holding the bag when they do  Ethereum at least justifies its current valuation with its fees  and may even be undervalued given its current volume   at least until it moves to PoS  and then who knows  and BTC s value comes literally from just being BTC  But since SOL seems like the next big thing  I figured I d run some back of the envelope numbers and ended up pretty stunned by exactly how bad the numbers looked A poster below notes this  but SOL is the trunk of a tree that s going to have thousands of branches  No forking required  but a ton of projects are being built on the network and things come out almost every day  Each of those projects require SOL as the base I would wager otherwise YouTube   comma   this cool video platform   ‍ ️ I also view buying sol coins as an investment in the next generation of tradefi  Since it s scalable from the get go it has the potential to solve a bunch of issues we have  think about voting over blockchain  sending and receiving secure messages  etc   I think of Sol as the tree  and serum and raydium are two of many branches to come I remember my first crypto Yes  you are correct most crypto tokens have no demand value  or have a value much lower than their current price  which is based entirely on ignorant speculation and will eventually drop to whatever floor is set by the demand the network requires to function its for allocations into their IDO and lots of airdrops 5  off https   ftx com  a 5OFF21 Yup forgot to mention I was doing both of those things 10  on FTX is what I m currently using my man Alot of those transactions are apparently canceled orders on Dexs so not really transactions thats what i read somewhere Where is the Serum DEX priced in at  Can you imagine a retail trader version of a decentralized exchange for   anything Maybe for governance  Thats how decentralize works Also make sure you enable  binding   not sure if that is the word  on your solana app on your ledger  And also close ledger live on your computer while trying to connect I tried firefox and it worked  Make sure to close and open the solana app repeatedly while you re trying to connect and that did it for me  I then tried on brave the next day and for some reason it worked  However  creating a staking account using ledger still doesn t work for both browsers and others on telegram are having the same issue But why hold SOL at all besides to pay for transaction fees  Staking will just counteract inflation Solana use POS  what will you stake without SOL token SOL USDT is supported by Binance Solana RULES Is it still good to get in at this current price of  38  40 parrot dApp as faucets so does Stableswap cringe army I get the same errors except when i move the screen to  configure  and leave it and then it finds everywhere and allows me in   I use an Ledger S   Got no idea why  but otherwsie it just kicks me out   But once I give it my keys then it stays connected agreed Was it really Contact help desk Thanks for the honest thoughts  For once  I hear something neutral honest objective about a coin in its own reddit    which is what we need  And he calls you spreading FUD  please I actually just came across  https   solfaucet com   https   solfaucet com    but I m still interested in learning the manual way  so I sent a DM No need for layer 2 to scale  game over I guess the code that runs the pipeline could be a sort of token with a proof of history  To make changes you would have to have a key file stored in an offline  ledger  like device nearby  Is that dumb  Anybody else got any ways our infrastructure could become more secure through blockchain Oh ya sorry you do have to add on raydium because that is the pools they use they said you might have to clear cache and connect again not sure why but fixed it a lot   Mine is working fine  I am using chrome  if you are using brave take down the shield to see if they are blocking something Solana should be in the top 10 Except that at first glance  Solana is more sexy  more younger and more appetizing   In short  the bride is more beautiful  All my wishes for happiness Just tried it out  It was pretty awesome  Way better interface than SolFlare  Are you guys planning on adding any other tokens for swapping any time soon Seems about as useful as an anti virus for people with an IQ above 100 and a hardware wallet  I have already bought IDOs on Raydium and it was fine You ll have to contact    Serum Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6   post your problem in    sollet   channel  amp  they might help if this is reversible Had to really search for this  In case anyone else struggles  you ll have to add the liquidity on raydium but then stake that on solfarm whats a realistic target goal Not focused on market cap  only interested in cultural paradigm shifts Solana is still pure speculation at this point  there will still be lots of waiting for us but in time we will be rewarded handsomely And revenue is about  001  of eth s   I love SOL but the current price is absolutely speculative I guess 450 mil could do a substantial amount of tech development Gotcha gotcha gotcha LOL this guy thinks market cap is proportional to its users and dev that s actually pretty bearish considering it has much less than 4  of the dev and users of ethereum Cool  thanks  I ll check it out So is that mean it s a good time to buy I m trying to stake some STEP USDC on solfarm but even after I connect my sollet  it doesn t seem to show my balances and this I can t add liquidity It s not  but you need it for sending the SPL tokens  Happened to me You can swap tokens within the wallet and view   use NFTs  You can also use Phantom to connect to pretty much any Solana application as well I m scared   toClickHahahaa goodMan Awesome  thanks  Are there any features other than a good looking interface that would make someone switch over from Solflare To be fair  I m not technically knowledgeable about code or anything  This was more of a shower thought  The establishment keeps blaming crypto for hacks  so maybe if the community helps they ll shut up about it Just replied APR is what you get if you don t compound it  APY requires compound it  Yet by yourself  you can t match an APY that something like Solfarm offers because we can t claim as often as the code can I like the idea Yeah  Solana is fast AF  I ve noticed that sometimes it s the other program that is  slow My prediction is the product of the other predictions I just did a transaction and it took 2 5 mins  It was really fast this morning  so maybe it is congested  not sure lol EWT token is something worth checking out in terms of energy Sounds like a good idea  but typical slow block chains could not keep up with one utility s SCADA and generation dispatch That s the wrong rocket there  Looks like NASAs Space Shuttle and nothing that SpaceX is Planning No Easier to raise a lot of money this way everstake one  https   everstake one  is at  13 and Binance at  10 10 Not an expert but my understanding is that the raw recovery phrase is not even stored on your ledger device  so it isn t something that can even be retrieved off the device itself Haha nice I love that song  I was actually going to post that same deep house song in response to yours but then I remembered how good this one is   https   www youtube com watch v dQw4w9WgXcQ  https   www youtube com watch v dQw4w9WgXcQ if you check the atomic wallet site  https   atomicwallet io staking  https   atomicwallet io staking it states  11 55 LMAO   of course as soon as I post  it resolves  Just took about 15mins or so  Interesting I don t think so How cute You can use step finance there you can see both This would basically reflect the composite index we see of the Nasdaq   14 000 or thereabouts Yeah  Facebook etc don t need the Nasdaq to exist though  The future apps on solana however do  I agree we are in uncharted territory here and there is no real  accepted  way of valuing this   My perspective is the valuation of a blockchain should be an accumulative amount based on the individual market caps of the apps which run on it  This seems fair I don t see any fallacy in your reasoning  And reading from the comments  I don t think you ve missed anything And 1000x more secure using hapi protocols and machine learning cyber security oracle s That is right  The SOL wallet is listed  I believe some people have already transferred over SOL to CB Pro  Those wallets cannot disappear    people would show up to the CB s CEO s house wanting answers But it seems  it being removed from the trading list  feels like it s going to take another while  A  while  in crypto feels like an eternity  It took seconds to cut in half crypto values that May 19  2021 morning  Ah  except if you owned Solana  Them investors held up well that day I noticed when you go on CB pro on the trading page they reorganized the cryptocurrency list and removed SOL from that list where it showed the cancel  only mode   But  you can see Solana on the portfolio page list Waiting for the times to come when you can buy Solana t shirt for  sol  haha Looks like I m sticking to the ole  reliable Solflare until I get more feedback from other people  What you re saying sounds pretty concerning Solana has achieved so much just within a year since Mainnet Beta launch  imagine what will happen in the next one or two O_oBtw  that s a really nice explanation  definitely will bookmark that for future reading gt My prediction is  300 by end of September  anyone else with me  what is this based on  I can say my prediction is btc is 1mill by august   doesnt mean anything Yeah that s what I thought too or prevent them from going online  I mean I think you can just create new recovery seed I think Not sure who here wants to compromise their hardware wallet with zero funds by clicking the button to see if it really pulls your private keys or blocks you when you click it I thought the secure element in the Ledger was supposed to prevent third parties from getting access to your private keys Well I don t know if they can or not  which is why I made this thread  The button  Show Secret Recovery Phrase  for hardware wallets should be disabled on settings  Too scared to click it In other words  boca chica is just a launchpad like raydium only smarter and more advanced Oh wow I didn t know that I live in US I just assumed it was available here  It s a great platform unfortunately the US is far behind when it comes to crypto regulations I wish I could get a Binance account  I live in Texas  and Binance is not available to citizens that live in my state  Well  at least since the last time I checked which was about 2 weeks ago How is that even possible  I m about to transfer my Solana from Solflare to Phantom  but not if they get my keys lol Where to buy that SAMO xdxd You can buy on Binance as well for lower fees Okay that makes sense  thank you Benny Goodman Bless thee  not bless thou   said the pedant Here you go  https   www investopedia com personal finance apr apy bank hopes cant tell difference Found this on a new site called google com check it out sometime In the beginning its lower because of fees  Then its buikding up Value  in the second sense is smoke and mirrors  Value is measured in units of currency  And that price of that is mostly set by supply and demand   Value in the second sense is not measurable and mostly reduces to a screaming match between people with different value systems this type of deep house   https   youtu be dQw4w9WgXcQ Haha knew I would get roasted  I stillLove you all I I ll get mine soon and the one with bull Hopefully  he doesn t siphoned shit out Thank you Yeah  Ok    well I have been close minded  yes  my whole head up my ass  in regards to utilizing all the available options out there    Seems use of multiple exchanges is the way to go    ok    I am going to get my 16 year old to work  have him be my assistant  that way he can learn about KYC  and all the BS required to open up accounts This question is asked every other day  No one knows KingPonzi  I promise you  I am NOT that stupid  In all actuality  I have bought a good amount of dips  Cryptocurrency is so new  and so unknown    that the FUD circulating is so predictable  I have my disposable monies waiting    reading Crypto charts have been helpful  but useless  cause the impact of the FUD to scare off retailers is NOT even a Conspiracy    its so blatantly out in the open  I wanted to know about the Coinbase Pro listing    I guess  what I will call    a new timeline for its listing  Since it seems  there is no mention on Coinbase s or Solana  At least I couldn t find it  Thank you for answering I fund through CB and purchase USDT  Transfer USDT to FTX and purchase SOL  Then off load for staking elsewhere  Whole process end to end is about 30mins or less The value is  2 000 I know  OXY   Oxygen is trying to do this they are way too slow in development though  Should be close to full release by now I hope Check out  SolFarm  https   solfarm io  Also Sonar WatchI m pretty sure there s more upcoming  We should have most of the necessary tools by Fall Ok  pimp Sol shirt  https   www amazon co uk dp B08XD3GK66 ref cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_V1HG7Q72DK76VR0X78QN NewDadman thanks for answering  Yeah  so   it seems only Coinbase Pro and Solana staff are the only one s that know when it will happen  as they work thru what they are working thru  Hopefully  they put out a communication soon You are right  it looks like it will be the thing to do  to buy elsewhere  and delay purchasing Solana I was hoping to avoid the process of signing up  wiring the money  buying and then transferring back to Solana Coinbase Pro wallet  I need to see what other exchanges offer  See  Uphold  will let me purchase  BUT I can t move to my Coinbase Pro wallet for 60 days  I guess its smart for them  I get it    they are hoping I forget and don t transfer and leave it there  But  testing for 60 days is excessive  I ll check to see what other s offer I can t imagine a more close minded buying strategy  It basically would only make sense if you re buying via Roth IRA  or other tax efficient vehicle  Strong advice to others  you can buy ETH then convert native ETH into SPL ETH  Solana s version  via Sollet   then convert into SOL on Raydium  It s much easier than it sounds and takes about 30mins  Otherwise you re waiting for a CB listing price which may be 60 100  higher from here  That could be a massive difference 5 years from now  I also recommend this method because it dissolves the fear of using Solana s DeFi ecosystem a skill set that will be crucial going forward Or just buy it on Uphold Don t think there is a defi browser in exodus That s what I thought  but that amount is actually a little bit less than the total in my wallet and the number hasn t changed in over a week I wouldn t wait for it to happen    it s going to happen but no one knows when   If you want to invest now there are plenty of other exchanges to buy SOL   FTX is recommended  but feel free to see for yourself on coin gecko I am seeing a lot about  hapi at the minute and glad to be involved  A lot to look forward to Amazon has SOL  nice I can confirm I am not a member of the team  In fact the community behind  hapi is now quite large u Kevin_from_Kin u beeman_nl might be able to help you Thank you  I believe some of your questions have already been answered  Solana uses PoH for timing action  which can be used with both PoW and PoS  In Solana  it s used with PoS  As per the whitepaper  any invalid transaction or censoring certain types of transactions or network participants will result in slashing that involves the removal and destruction of a portion of a validator s delegated stake in response to intentional malicious behaviour  If a validator is slashed  all token holders who have delegated stake to that validator will lose a portion of their delegation  While this means an immediate loss for the token holder  it also is a loss of future rewards for the validator due to their reduced total delegation I am also planning to write subsequent articles about seven other technological innovations on Solana in a phased manner I think you are making an interesting thought experiment The transaction fees are depending on supply and demand   if adaption and with this demand increases  the network gets more busy and with this the transaction fees will go up as well  The current max is 50k TPS   in comparison  NASDAQs order book requires 500k TPS  So still a long way to go  And this is just NASDAQ   we are not talking about all other stock exchanges in the world or the visa mastercards etcBUT in order to get mass adoption in the order of NASDAQ etc  you need technical scalability and economics that make sense  If we would remain at  10 per transaction like we had on ETH  the entire DeFi movement will remain a niche play for some geeks or idealistic ppl who might wanna pay a premium for the decentralization but it will not be a mass product  So coming back to your question  IMO SOL s ACTUAL value is hard or impossible to quantify right now bc of WAY too many unknowns  For now it is a highly speculative bet without any underlying economics to justify prices  But if solana gets the wide adaption we hope and solana actually solves real problems  i e  runs billions of real world transactions on the chain   we will have a better idea of it s true value It s OK man  we ve all been there Don t think so  got less than 1 staked there so if there is a minimum it s a low amount Any minimum amount Any minimum amount Are u for real lol dona mara and dyma boudrin are the 2 main judges at the hackathon and one is ceo of hapi and the creator of bocachica   the other is the ceo of hacken who launched hapi via the hackenfoundation com  Hapi stands for Hacken api    suggest u go to do some research before putting down a project  Good place to start is the tweet from solana official account about bocachica or u could check official speakers and judges on the solana website for hackathon For Etheruem to make it it suffice to have good layer 2s and that is happening right now you think that s off  wait til you start calculating the stock market Thank you  Glad I could be of help  You can certainly direct any questions for better understanding The irony is this is not from the DEV s  we have asked the dev s and support team to help us promote on media platforms but they declined   HAPI will be huge with or without you  DYOR before being so pessimistic Hapi is an onchain cyber security machine learning oracle that can intercept hacks   prevent rugpulls and  stop the flow of stolen funds into ecosystems  All products that launch on bocachica will have this security as standard making it the safest place to invest in idos   It s an absolute game changer for any project that use it  Why wouldn t you use it  Seems absolutely brilliant  It will be the preferred and recommended ido platform for solana You can t buy Solana on Pancakeswap  You can buy it on official exchanges  Binance  Bitfinex  Crypto com  FTX  Blockfolio You can t buy Solana within trust wallet but you can hold it there when you send it from another exchange like ftx When flashloans on rust The worst people seem to be for Happi Boca whatever the fuck now Couldn t they launch on Raydium or is there something special about Boca Hapi besides moon boy hype SAMO was created by its own separate community  Like other projects on Solana  Solana added the project to their website  It was not  created by a company  The world is changing  so is crypto  It s not outside of the realm of possibilities that each Layer 1 blockhain adopts and develops its own  memecoin  mascot LOL way to admit you are a buffoon  No  not everyone is simply gambling  Your insecure attacks and overreaction to objective facts that you don t like only reveal that you re the one putting your chips on a roulette table when it comes to crypto  You clearly don t know what you are talking about  and because of that you don t think others do either Before I retired due to all the wealth I accumulated from  gambling  with cryptos  I used to be in a leadership position in IT for a med large size firm  I managed very complex programs and projects that were transparent to the average user  I used to get stakeholders in the company come to me with a CDW ad they saw that said it could do X or Y and ask why we re not using it  It s because they are clueless as to what s happening under the hood  Anyone who understands systems migration and integration would laugh at clowns like you or these people who voice their puerile assessment as if it s worth listening to   ETH is inefficient  SOL is the future  Tech moves fast     The number one advantage crypto has against the traditional status quo systems is its decentralization  It s what provides a level playing field for everyone  It allows trustless security to the world without concerns of one entity or nation having power to corrupt it or take it down  If you weren t just a simple low life gambler  you might have understood this simple fact  The utmost importance for L1 should be decentralization which is what ETH is focusing on  Upper layers can work on tx speed with less decentralization which compartmentalizes the impact of attacks  Fools like you have eaten up the whole  Solana doesn t need layers for tx speed  as if this is purely a good thing  I am hedging my bet and own SOL because I believe the future is going to have multiple blockchains  and solutions where less decentralization is needed will fill those needs Since you re not much of a reader   here s a video that CoinBureau  https   youtu be 1jzpL27SOak  released just yesterday talking about decentralization and Solana  Good luck with your gambling You have to approve displaying pub key on your Ledger in that short time period when it tries to connect or the error message is displayed So close to going above litecoin Click on the staking button  And the you see on the bottom the unstake amount  That is your total balance with your apy Now I need a golf hat  white and black polo   ️‍ ️ god this solana sub is a disaster Can you help me   Do you know how I can buy solana currency from Dapps in trustwallet   Because I went to the pancake section and it did not support Solana At the time is writing SOL is so close to passing litecoin  amp  chain link That s funny  I just ordered my SOL shirt from Amazon Oh my God  I m going to die right now and check again to see if I can add  thank you   So I delete this request so that others do not get it wrong TrustWallet supports Solana Lmfao   Profit   stability Yes you are correct   i have so far been able to keepAll transactions under 10  worth ofEth   each time  So it s been quite fair pricing IMO  But def something to keep in mind as u said That makes it even more relevant  It means you are wasting 3x the overpriced exchange fee actually irrelevant if  SOL is 3x in 1 year thanks  wonder if its worth jumping ship to get 1 5 All inflation is done through staking rewards  and obviously less Solana is going to be staked than exists  so staking rewards should  always  be higher than inflation Hopefully bro That great for the proyect  more like this will sea a more mainstream aproach I believe they use a 3rd party exchange  So you pay for the network fee  coin related  plus the exchange fee plus an exodus convenience fee  As far as I know thats how it goes Blessings Telegram my friend https   t me hapiHF Holy fuck dude  rhats so incredible    I had been wondering like  the amount of rugs and moon memeCoins that fucked people  how goddamn hard is it to prevent these douchebags fromDoing rugs  I m sure it s more complicated than I couldImagine   and those peopleYou speak of sound phenomenal   So fucking cool    Thank you  Mind me  Asking where did you learn the most about hapi and stuff  PerhPsPoint me jn  A direction You can t even post there Yes pretty much    HAPI has machine learning so it can keep up with new trends coming in from the hacking world    plus the Co founder and ceo is one of the world s best white hat hackers and has many hackathons under his built so I m sure he and his 3 teams of devs can keep up   There also backed and audited by Hacken the largest cyber security firm in crypto who also have a strategic partnership with  SOL   I can see these three making waves in the crypto industry especially when the need for cyber security ramps up in people s heads lol Ahhh yeah  might want to check out support at the Solana discord Thanks for the resources  just glancing through the first one and it looks fantastic  exactly what I was looking for Eh forgot to mention  I have tried Brave  Chrome  and FireFox Firefox doesn t even show Ledger Pop

identical in value I swap eth for  sol just about sollar for dollar   5 7  gas max   When you re swapping  5 eth that s soWorth it So my balance is a little higher than the amount staked  but neither number has changed at all and it s been over a week  Can we not see the rewards until we unstake Winner of hackathon gets launched by the brand new Ido platform   Might take couple weeks as team needs a little work finishing up smart contracts for solana integration but when it s ready it will be HUGE Everyone buy SOL Omfg and I get paid at midnight       SOL      I can t wait   Hackathon  on us tho sick Lol that is not how you calculate value  not even close  In fact it is the cheap tx fees that give it value  Will you rather hop on a high tx fee blockchain I m happy with my sol I got in at 26 so if it keeps climbing regardless im in profit Where is solfarm token  Tulip The day did not come lol 1 Swap from SOL to USDC then swap from USDC to RAY I guess it s a bug due to lack of volume but this is how I solved that transaction fail issue How much  sol does glasses Samo is ridiculous  nothing original  Dogecoin is funny because it was a joke and it started becoming something  else  now  this coin is created as a copy of Dogecoin trying to make Solana s ecosystem more popular  it s totally the opposite  Created by a company Maybe y all could get into contact with the  Maps me  https   Maps me  people  Maybe there could be a collab opportunity with them   https   decrypt co 54326 alameda leads 50 million seed funding round in maps me  https   decrypt co 54326 alameda leads 50 million seed funding round in maps me Would be nice if Solana had a fancy Anaconda like interface for dAPPs and then Phantom could be used as the wallet across them Serum This kind of thing will need to be continuously monitored because Blockchain technology has yet to proliferate into mainstream Finance so something like this does not exist yet  I believe once the like of VISA recognize that they can process more transactions on DEFI than on CEFI then this kind of partnership will be initiated Thank I will have a read and come back to ask more  Surprisingly there is a Chinese version on the same page as well gt  AltermativelyAlso I had no idea about Dapps being required to hold a   in SOL  thanks for the good info ok that is why GPU is also important factor gt Dapps need to hold a certain   of token in SOL  like Strategic partner  Ok  This is the sort of information that I m looking for  This creates a lot of natural demand for SOL  Is there any other information about this how is exodus offering 10 37 As I wrote above  stock exchanges are worth far less than the value of the transaction volume that occurs on them  NASDAQ  Inc  is worth about  30 billion Yes  that s exactly what I m saying  All else equal  if fees go down on Ethereum  people would need to buy less ETH  which means there s less demand for ETH  and the price of ETH would go down  Ethereum is currently in this cycle where fees go up when the price of ETH goes up  So you need to hoard ETH now if you want to afford future transactions  This creates a ton of demand for ETH now  which pushes the price up  which makes you want to hoard even more ETH  and so on  Because Ethereum is also so congested  there s a lot of competition for transactions  so people are willing to pay more and miners can charge more  But if ETH 2 0 solves these problems  the intrinsic demand for ETH will go way down   But  since Solana s fees are calculated based on their value in USD  again  this might change   there is no connection between the price of SOL and the USD cost of transactions  So you don t need to buy and hold SOL because you re scared that transaction fees will go up  You just buy whenever you need to use it  Again  at  current  maximum throughput  that really just translates to about  16 million in volume per year for the entire ecosystem TLDRWhy is Solana Proof of History so important  Proof of History creates a historical record that proves that an event has occurred at a specific moment in time You need syncronisation across a financial De Fi blockchain network in order to ensure issues like double spend do not occur  Distributed ledger technologies ensure you can t spend the same money twice  however there is massive risk when outsourcing to external third party atomic clock providers  network delays  relativity and time dilation which can produce inaccuracies in time sync across a global network This is where Solana tech has the problem sorted  with their Proof of History virtual clock  Synchronized clocks are interesting because they can be used to improve the performance of distributed algorithms  They make it possible to replace communication with local computation   Liskov  B  Practical uses of synchronized clocks in distributed systems In this case it means a high throughput  high performance blockchain Fair  But as a point of reference  the first one I was able to find    NASDAQ the  company   i e   the company that runs the NASDAQ exchange  has a market cap of about  28 billion  Maybe it will end up being Visa  which has a market cap of almost  500 billion  but again  the market cap of a stock is not the same as the market cap of a coin  Most of the arguments here seem to imply that the market value of the coin is higher than the market value of an equity  but I m almost certain that it s the opposite and haven t yet been convinced otherwise Pitvipersunglasses com Sol is used for fees More uses will arise  for example using sol as collateral on loans  I do see your point but I think you are missing the forest for the trees  There arent many metrics you can point to to fundamentally value a crypto What I would cite you is  user growth  daily active addresses  TVL in liquidity protocols growth  Those are my metrics and they are all strong for SOL Sol is fundamentally superior to eth in every single way  The lack of economic incentive for holding the sol token means that transactions are cheap and the user experience is strong  It encourages use and growth on the network  not stagnation  I dont WANT to operate on a network that charges me  5 50 in tx fees for contracts  Im happy paying less than a cent a million times over and sending that to the people securing the network I LM on solana  Its a great experience POH is not a consensus mechanism  You can find more about POH here  https   multicoin capital 2019 07 16 the separation of time and state   https   multicoin capital 2019 07 16 the separation of time and state Solviperos com Revenue  maybe isn t the right term  It s the amount of SOL that must be purchased in order for people to use the network  which is sort of the intrinsic value of the coin  For example  I only hold enough BNB in my BSC wallet to pay for transaction fees  I only buy more when I run out  Obviously  not everyone is like me  but anyone who buys more is really only doing so because they think other people will want to buy more  which pushes the price up  In a system where transactions are expensive and the supply of coins is limited  that s rational  If Ethereum does  say   30 million in transaction fees per day  then people need to buy about  10 billion in ETH per year   just to use the network   And that rises if the price of ETH rises  That creates a ton of natural demand and volume for ETH  SOL is the opposite  It s super cheap to use the network  As the price of SOL goes up  the cost of transactions per SOL goes  down   You can spend  10 on SOL right now and have enough to cover your transactions for life  Again  great for the usability and tech of Solana  but awful for the value of SOL  Why else would someone need to buy it Again  it s possible I m missing something  Is SOL used to settle every transaction on the blockchain  So basically every Solana transaction is essentially buying an equivalent amount of SOL  So if I trade RAY for SRM  for instance  is SOL involved in the transaction in anyway besides just paying for fees Solana is the only blockchain that natively supports intra shard parallelism via its SeaLevel runtime  SeaLevel executes transactions natively on GPUs  When Nvidia releases new GPUs in 12 24 months with 8 000 cores  this number will double every 18 months   the Solana network s computational bandwidth will roughly double  every 18 months too    source  https   multicoin capital 2021 05 25 technical scalability creates social scalability How do I get these glasses It seems like you are very knowlegable with regard to Solana  would you be kind enough to answer a few questions   First  Can you please explain the function of PoW in Solana  since when it comes to Solana most of the discussion has a propensity to focus solely on PoH    Second  Does it serve as an incentive for validators to behave properly like in other PoS  Also  if PoH already works as a time stamp why would it still take a few blocks time to reach finality Lastly  regarding the hardware limitation  If I correctly there are 2 functions here  1  Internet speed and bandwidth cost  as transactions  data  are transmitted via the internet network and with more transactions  the faster internet is needed for validators to loading all these data   2  Hardware  What I understand is as a direct consequence of high TPS and smart contract capability  there is a need to utilize data storage large enough to record all 2 days  worth of transactions  But as I listen to the interview and reading around there seem to be more requirements for other hardware such as the CPU as well   Can you elaborate  Thank You Looking forward to seeing who has won  amp  what will be the first project launched on Boca Chica for Solana  And the winner is        Solana Hapi and Boca Chica holders True  but BTC s value is simply that it s BTC  It s the currency that underlies the entire crypto ecosystem  It will be on Ethereum  Solana  Cardano  whatever  It s a huge bet to think that will eventually be SOL instead  ETH currently justifies the valuation because you need to buy  a lot  of ETH to use Ethereum  which creates a lot of consistent demand for it  If you buy 1 SOL at  30  you re set on transactions for life  Maybe that s similar to to if you had bought ETH at  30 in 2017 or something and just held onto it  But since SOL transaction fees are essentially calculated according to their USD value  they don t rise as the price of SOL rises  If the price of SOL goes up  it pays for even more transaction fees Yeah  I think you are leaving out the whole ecosystem in your valuation process  How much is a stock exchange worth  How much will the ecosystem associated with SOL usage be worth in 5 10 years  Think of SOL as the oil needed to make every application in the ecosystem function properly  SOL is much more than a currency value  it s value lies also in its utility associated with the whole of the ecosystem 50 soon  Hold Thanks I understood about 60 It s  10 per million  as long as the wallets in question have the token minted    Minting a token to a wallet costs about 40 cents currently I think you ve completely misunderstood the value proposition of these networks somehow   Value is not restricted to tx fees    that s    that s just    not how this works at all this looks extremely sketchy Make sure you actually click the button to stake  SoL does not automatically stake  If you have staked properly it will come in Site is down Thank you for the thoughtful response  I m just another lazy but curious person  Armed with this info  I hope to make a better decision when I fill my next bag Solana Discord is the best place for that imo   https   discord com invite pquxPsq  https   discord com invite pquxPsq Evaluating a network token like a stock usually doesn t give you much helpful information  Its all supply and demand Its not really that steep if you consider SOL s increase in price year over year Exodus PHANTOM wallet is GOAT I think they have big plans With this assumption of valuation then everything is overpriced in the crypto market  A token is not ownership in a company  A token like Solana is a utility vehicle  That valuation should be based more on what  you can do with it  I e  expanding ecosystem  Eth fees are about to come down with EIP 1559  So then you are saying Ethereum will be valued less with an improved blockchain  It makes no sense Pancakes for example Why Solana is not available on DEX This Decrease by 15  each year  Why so steep What we are missing is a clear index of these apps and their respective values Don t think of solana as a company on which to judge a price tag based on 10x revenue  Price solana like you price a global exchange eg the FTSE   which should be total utility and ultimately the value of the apps which run on Solana Phantom has the nicest looking interface among other Solana wallets  wish they continue upgrading it inside as well for a better workflow gt assuming the crypto market eventually converges on some semblance of efficiencyIt is just pure speculation and market manipulation  This bullrun has scamcoins outperforming shitcoins  shitcoins outperforming hype coins  hype coins outperforming utility coins  and utility coins outperforming bitcoin yeah I m really looking forward to the following hackathon projects come up  that s really nice to see Solana doing it that often  cuz more interesting projects bring value to the ecosystem
2021-06-07,42.25367912,44.10055822,38.0908398,The entire crypto market is moving in sync  Everything just got hammered because of musks bitcoin tweets how can you say it doesn t affect them Why are you convinced please build it and make it multichain with all the explorers GTS is a designated market maker on the NYSE they maintain the price accuracy and exchange on a number of stocks  etfs  commodities  They will run the nodes that link to Pyth running on Solana  This will be a good high throughout bridge to decentralized finance  Other oracles are too slow  Solana can scale to less than  lt 100msThey manage thousands of prices  buy and sells  But theres many other market makers aswell they will retrieve data from I know I m gonna sound like a  child here    But in simple terms what s the difference between these  projects  built on Solana  and a normal app from the app store But would they still need to obtain the data from the NYSE or Nasdaq or is there another way the data is pulled This allows traditional markets to enter the defi space at sub second speeds  That data can be used to in turn tokenize traditional derivatives accurately  In the future most people will prefer using the defi space for investing and trading instead of these shit centralized platforms in traditional markets  Most of these traditional platforms really suck  The UX experience sucks  It s so much easier to onboard in crypto than traditional brokers    besides robinhood of course Id probably just stake sol  I think within 5 years solana will be well worth hundreds if not more  Btc is less risky but having 10  apy is great  Ultimately its up to you  50 50 is also good Searching twitter or from people on the cope discord  There s too many to track them all but I think I catch most  Some are scams but they get easy to spot after a while Yeah and it s deflationary  I picked up 11k last week but I think it s a little cheaper atm Other then having 200 Cope where do your Air Drops come from I did get some solape last week but mostly I use it to trade newer smaller coins that aren t available on ftx  I get a lot of airdrops so I use it to sell some of those too Also is there a SolApe Token Cool  What do you get I ve used it and it s a great dex  Better than anything else on solana afaik I don t know  It sounds like they could have just used Chainlink  Interesting article Bitcoin and Solana just crashed about 5   I don t think Bitcoin going down is affecting alts as badly as it used to  Especially alts like Solana and Polygon for some reason I took a look at SolApe because I thought the Ape was cute but it seemed kind of rugpullish to me  Anyone else have any thoughts Why does a dating app need to be on a blockchain He s just an over confident laggard  He shunned BTC at first then recently came around  When you first realize the value of crypto  it s easy to develop tunnel vision  Especially when your first purchase s  2 5x  Only until you get burned for being a maxi do you realize you may not know everything  I fully expect Saylor to denounce his maxi ways and discover these protocols have more value than a USD short JFC  you re right  I literally can t believe that  major fuck up Amen What makes you bearish on BTC do we pay chicks with solana for hookups   lol Soldate is gonna be 99  dorky middle aged guys It would be nice if we had post labels for yield farming staking It s because we are so early  When BTC is around 10  Dominance hopefully things are more diverged Saylor is a meme Quick answer  BTC will continue to go down  SOL will most probably go up  It s your choice  Check historical sharpe also  Do your own research Binance US if you re in the states  also you can set up a wallet for your sol on sollet io We should collaborate  I ve got a few idea Binance  specially now that they have SOL EUR Yeah it can take a long time  especially if it gets slammed like a couple weeks ago when sol did like 150 000 000 in 24hr transactions Stake Solana I wouldn t trade sol for bitcoin  Way too early Thank you Fuck I can only spend so much money   what s everyone coppin Sometimes my sollet wallet seems to get disconnected and the whole website stops working  understandably Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns If you want to be patient just wait for it to appear on Coinbase This thing is going to be big Diverge was just my way of saying that SOL needs to separate itself and stand alone  It  and most others track too tightly still  I m 50  SOL so pretty vested in it and expect it to continue growing but I hate that so much is dependent right now on BTC  Not sure if that makes sense It s been insane  I read about SOL and studied the fundememtals and decided to go all in on it  Just seems like a win  The other thing is the branding seems strong  Most other cryptos look like a nerdy teenager drew it in the 90s well youve seen it on a steady price increase I got my SOL cheap For reference  thats about 850 solana tokens at this current time and day Have at least some btc sat no Sounds like you want some just DCA some SOL into BTC when sol pumps FTX com What big divergence  Can you explain    Or have a link to a YouTube video about it You must have never heard of Micheal Saylor Could easily afford BTC but hold most in SOL  SRM  SAMO  STEP    besides Solana chain SNX and SHIB  A much bigger stake is in stocks though    safety first I started with Binance   USSwitched to Raydium SERUM with USDC after taking some profit  In USDC  on a Stellar DEX token  using Circle to swap the USDC from one chain to the other  Wait  Just saw you said  easiest     Sorry  Nevermind that second one Lots of words I don t even understand on here  but I m pumped Diversify   When btc goes down  most alts follow and drop more than btc  Its better to keep 50  btc and 50  alts Until there s a big divergence I d say go with 50  BTC 50  Sol  You ll have a big bag you can stake while still hedging with BTC  They are both trending pretty tightly so you it shouldn t matter too much until things diverge At least on FTX you can withdraw usdc as spl token on solana Great buy  Yeah I bought mine at  30  If you in no way need the money  Then I d let it ride but if you re happy with the gains and would like to realize some profit maybe sell like 20  of your stack  Idk lol 100  in Sol is a bit rich for my blood If you like meme SAMO STEP Finance Binance US  Blockfolio  FTX us BTC will die I think you can make the case for taking some profits in BTC and or ETH for the sake of diversification  though the tax implications of this could be expensive in a lot of jurisdictions   but IMO SOL has more upside not Defi but Hedgehog Markets had their beta recently and it was really fun That s the waay Current official HAPI telegram channel has 19674 members  There is a SCAM one with just about 20k  members and they have a pinned message about a give away scam   Just know that never will they private message you on telegram nor do give aways  hapi that is  Anyone private messaging you block them and anyone acting as if you have to send them any address or crypto or money is a scam 100 Hey that s our little logo in there It s a dammed if you do and dammed if you don t scenario  You know what will happen  You sell your SOL and buy BTC to only watch it grow a few percentage  Meanwhile SOL blasts off  But if you don t sell and buy BTC then SOL will level off and BTC will be a million dollar coin   ‍ ️ Not coolaid  I think  Just good tech That s a tough one I thing BTC is way less risky than SOL but it would heart to get rid of my SOL Not having the same issue with BNB XLM  amp  Ada I am to  But did I drink the coolaid on this one Most of my portfolio is solana now  I m convinced that it will out perform pretty much every other currency over the next five years  Well  sol and some other sol backed tokens such as RAY and SRM Hold SOL I m 100  SOL  I bought in when it was  20  I have seen some amazing gains this last few weeks  Today was good when it hit  44  It s retreating at the moment  But all mine is staked so no quick decisions  Lol It s like deciding what will give you the most gains  In some ways all the big caps go up together  But no one wants to be caught losing out  I m not big on lots of diversification  Learning from Warren Buffet he says   Diversification is a protection against ignorance   Buffett once said    It  makes very little sense for those who know what they re doing I currently hold 25  eth 20  link 11  Matic 10  Sol 7  cardano 6  bnb 4  rune 3  vet and 3  algo I m in the same boat  I think solana as well as a lot of other promising alts have a lot of potential  I m trying to make life changing gains  Going al in on BTC probably will happen but will take a lot longer in my opinion  Even if one of my alts 10x s that should be enough to take profits and move some of the gains to eth or Btc  I have more faith in ETH than BTC at the moment  I think all crypto is a great time to get in now to hold for the long run  Imo Came across this today a Play to Earn game that encompasses DeFi and a Dex built on the Solana chain https   staratlas com I say split it either two or three parts   i mean that s what I would do but I m just a Welcome to the w3b I use blockfolio Serum DEX   It s the canonical example of a defi exchange I m struggling to decide what to do  Especially with what s coming up with BTC  But Solana has massive potential to Moon with that much SOL Likely bitcoin will regain its value but solana probably have more space to grow   that s a very hard question FTX US  https   FTX US  is definitely the best experience I have had with an exchange  Will early credit up to  4500 in ACH  wish it were more   need to KYC in order to purchase via debit card  fees are kinda shitty tho  or wire money  haven t tried this yet They still have time to rebrand it Star Atlas is going to be incredible  I m thinking of getting into the energy sector in the metaverse     10x whatever Tesla will try to do FTX us Raydium io is a premier AMM   DEX Others to check out  SolFarm  Orca  Mango MarketsMercurial Finance will be launching soon This will be huge If you go to Solana com they have a comprehensive overview of their ecosystem that is helpful The current hackathon should yield some new interesting defi projects  Follow Solana on Twitter for updates FTX is technically centralized  but it s built on Solana Binance US  https   Binance US  if you in the US   Otherwise Binance Solanium looks promising  one week old or something like that Awesome thanks I didn t notice that at first  but now it s so obvious  Sheesh Can t believe the dating app missed the opportunity to call it Solmate Polygon is a  layer 2  to essentially make up for Ethereum s short term problems   So when Ethereum catches up  Polygon may not bee needed anymore With that in mind  Solana can be used in essentially the same way as Polygon by using wormhole or wrapping ETH and ERCs directly  There is no need for Polygon  Solana is already super fast and cheap on layer 1 Unhelpful They aren t  shills   they are fellow humans trying to use this stuff  We should help not play politics This stance of blind loyalty to Coinbase as if they are somehow better than Ftx or Binance is hilarious  They clearly aren t gonna release it on CB Pro until its back at all time highs  It takes 15 mins to setup an account on Ftx us and buy  Transgender it to a ledger in 10 days Unfortunately Binance is not available in my state Typical scam You need to pay additional funds to unlock your previous funds You got scammed bro OK sorry if I accused you  it s just frustrating for me  I have been trying so hard to get accurate info out What s the difference between Serum and OpenSerum  I too kept trying to find TULIP and main Serum didn t have it Again you are completely wrong   And I guess you downvoted me to 0 because you didn t like being told so APY is NOT THE SAME IN THE WHOLE SOLANA NETWORK   Even if every validator set the exact same commission  APY would not be the same across all of them  because their vote performance would determine their actual APY  and vote performance between validators varies quite a bit And who said it   YOU SAID IT  Any validator you delegate   stake your SOL to will get you the same APY as every validator there  the only difference is the Fees they take from you  which differs from one valdiator to another  That is completely false I missed the part of the validator performance only  you don t have to accuse me with   misinformation Who said performance will be EXACTLY the same btw valdiators  i was referring to the APY  it s the same in the whole Solana Network  what makes the difference is the Fee taken by the validator  validator missing some blocks will EVENTUALLY affect your APY with that validator  yes i know that too  So it s not COMPLETELY FALSE like you said It s going on Coinbase Please man  stop spreading misinformation   Maybe you are not doing it intentionally  but it s hard enough educating people on this topic without outright misinformation There are no 10  APY validators   Any that tell you they return 10  are lying   See my post above in response to ansi09 This is completely false Validator performance  and thus APY returns  is determined both by commission and by voting performance of the validator It is  DEFINITELY NOT  the same for every validator If you want to know the returns of validators  see https   stakeview appBut I recognize your username ansi09   I swear you ve been told this before  or if not  you should at least have seen it in other posts Asked already just 20 hours ago https   www reddit com r solana comments ntgir8 staking_solana_how_to_choose_validator h0rwnae Notably excluded   SOLAPE Huh Oh I figured they were too boomer to be that quick Your mom won t let you make an Ftx us account huh   1000 grand lmao The establishment is doing the hacks to discredit crypto pleb For those of us with jobs the  5 10k computer cost isn t an issue its more that you need like  450k to be profitable because of the block fee It s up top you to choose any validator that suits your needs  i m just telling you that delegating your SOL to the  1 valdiator is the same as delegating to the last validator in the list  same APY  only difference is that they take different Fees  that s all Eventually you will learn the hard way that Solana s architecture is a breakthrough and renders Ethereum pointless  Eth 2 0  even if it comes out  isn t anywhere near the scalability and speed Solana is today Can I trade  20 of coins on uniswap for less than  50 in gas fees yet I didn t edit shit and if you think Rust is the only language you can use for Solana when it can use any lang that targets LLVM you are clueless Why is SRM not moving to well at the moment Thx a lot that I viewed were 10  is that decent or could I find better You could use  https   changenow io   https   changenow io      I have used it a few times with no issues Binance gt What can I expect to get as a APY and where can I see that  i e  is variable between the validators  You can check the   APY   from here     https   solanabeach io validators    https   solanabeach io validators   APY   7 74  right now  the moment i m writing this  Any validator you delegate   stake your SOL to will get you the same APY as every validator there  the only difference is the Fees they take from you  which differs from one valdiator to another The answer is to why anyone would rent a parathread is the shared security model  Building your own validator set is unessecary on dot  and thus very attractive to smaller teams with big ideas and limited starting capital  Your analysis is very short sighted me thinks  You did not even mention it  almost like you re unaware Thank you  Glad could help Thank you that today  it did      Drawnfromh20      Commands   opt out    delete It did that today Hmmm we need to  Them This is because solflare needs a better RPC server Thank you Just average your cost basis ie total dollar amount you spent on sol and  subtract the dollar value of the sol you sell Bruh ever heard of Uniswap  Also I think there are 20 dex s that do more volume then Raydium  U can find this information by going under the DEX tab on Coin Gekko and looking at rankings by volume Mate  have you even researched what Hapi and Boca Chica is  This collaboration will be huge for Solana  Have a look  Binance Smart Chain   8 hacks in a row on their projects  Projects launched on Boca Chica will be secure and legitimate   this will set the bar for launchpads and give Solana a first mover advantage What would you say on eth compares to serum and or raydium  Trading on serum is lightning fast  you can actually place limit orders trade in a decentralized manner  I think the biggest thing eth has going for it is nfts  I own eth  I like eth  I just don t think it s the future  It s like aol xerox  Maybe yahoo  they will stick around but become less and less relevant over time You are missing something hehe  You need to go to    welcome   channel  amp  choose a role by clicking on the right Emoji that suits your needs  Yu ll then be able to see   amp  write in other channels  according to the role you chose   Imgur  https   imgur com sIo8yPG Am I missing something or are there no real active channels in English on there  I only see the Guideline and Welcome channels  then the Developer channels are all in other languages Well  that seems wrong  because in the wallet itself  the  Yearly Yield  has actually gone down to  7   since my original post   Hmmm Lol not to shit on your comment but I feel like we need a Daily Thread for more of these types of posts  There is no real outlet for them on this subreddit without a Daily Thread I think it could just be in addition to that  Multicoin Capital and FTX have a lot of interest in the project as well so they could probably pay for the hardware and also have professionals set it up and service it too  I d assume that a lot of the Hackathon teams might have enough knowledge to keep things running Thank u homie  Always open to discuss    Btw I m dumb bullish on SOL  FTT  and anything FTX related just keeping it real I think Shinobi Systems is a cool name but I feel like everything after with the   0  fees and the rocket emoji make the name seem a bit less trustworthy for some reason  I m a noob looking for somewhere to stake btw and have been looking around on solanabeach and  validators app  https   validators app   Maybe you can poll on the Solana subreddit to see what name format people find most trustworthy if staking Can someone respond to this instead of downvoting  I d appreciate a rebuttal I think the   reward makes more sense  Validator is a job  Solana devs may not know how to run a validator Here s a quick questionThe interest rate  is that number based on the actual    I staked or that number that I get after the total is stakedLike staked something like  130 in usdc step but the pooled amount is something like 4 8 So is the apy based on the  130 or the 4 8 Any ideas on ways for them to expand the amount of validators  Maybe I m misunderstanding the economics of the whole thing but the overall goal is to greatly increase the amount of validators  but then it seems that individual validators don t particularly want more validators because it cuts into commission    anyway  I m just an investor still just learning about this stuff  I posted this just now   https   www reddit com r solana comments nu0foz validator _setup _as _prize _for _hackathon   https   www reddit com r solana comments nu0foz validator_setup_as_prize_for_hackathon   amp  x200B Also  if you haven t named your validator I feel like Sand Dollar is a good name    Way too many sketchy looking validator names usability drivers users and adoption  amp  x200B Ethereum didn t get as big as it is now by being some random coin  it was the usability and capabilities that drove those users to it What do you think is going to happen once the fees balloon back up to 50   100   etc what kind of nonsense is this about  revenue  Does that mean that nano is completely worthless  Since transactions have no fees Does that mean that the eth 2 0 upgrade will make ethereum less  profitable  in market cap  since it would reduce fees  amp  x200B Does that mean that I can create some shit coin and charge 100  per transaction   and then i should have the largest market cap since it generates the most  revenue    amp  x200B Also  you completely disregard things like staking  and the fact that the only ones profiting from mining are the ones with ASCII computers and specialized hardware Resistance at  40   Buying SOL is a bet they can get dapps to build on their platform and the platform will work as advertised   If you buy it hold for at least 24 months When staking Cool share   Thanks Tbh I been using SOL  A lot  And it s still not mature  Very little tokens  only a few Dexs  little liquidity compared to ETH  Agree to disagree homie  I still like SOL it s just no where near where ETH is regardless of 2 0  And if you can t see that  I recommend taking your coins off exchange and using the networks for yourself mr software engineer exodus wallet allows you to stake  currently at 10 apy it doesnt matter   The only thing that matters is the price and when you put the order in   First in at 45  is first out at 45  and so on Lol Eth 2 0 is never comming out  Any software project that is more than a year out  dec 2022 now  means they have no clue when its coming out  Source I work on software Not too mention Solana appears to have a more active or at least rival development community and a lot of the talent left Ethereum in general for other chains  I think the bubble with Eth is thinking they have devs more locked down than they do in reality I m pretty new to crypto  was trying to do a little reading about bocachica and came across this etherscan page  Is this a new related coin or did I stumble across something else  Hesitate to ask because I don t want to look like a noob but here it is bocachica  https   etherscan io token 0x157e214d15da669bc4b5a90fb4e55a9b98139474 If Solana doubled their transaction fees it would still be pretty low right It s less speculative then ADA and Dot but ETH remains king IMO  I m still bullish on SOL thou I think solana is less speculative than eth  I think its very speculative to believe eth can provide a long term smart contract solution  Their current solution is slow  expensive  and not scalable  Solanas is fast  cheap and scalable  Eth might die   solana will keep growing Lies  all of them     Actual returns at https   stakeview app Thanks  It should get better over time  Right now we re using Raydium V4 pools  we ll be adding Serum support soon  We will continue to invest in the swapper for sure FTX us for sure Edit  I went through the very same process with this idea in mind 2 weeks ago Nice one  I will keep an eye on this project Luna Network  in relation with Terra Luna  Longing for that integration on Solana Sol is already cheap  No need for an L2 You can stake your SOL on the FTX exchange if you want them super chill one click UI feels I know how it works for bitcoin so I explain it there  Your transaction is as u said with probability 99 percent included in the first block produced as long as less than 99 percent of the miners are adversarial  But there is a one percent chance that your transaction doesn t get included by an adversarial node or it does get included along some other false transactions made by an adversarial node   What happens here is that the good nodes continue making new blocks but a fork happens in the chain  think of a single chain splitting up into two chains  a good one and a bad one    Now from an miner point of view you always pick the longest chain as the valid chain    Therefore by waiting for other block to be appended  for example five    the exchange can make sure you are on the longest chain and therefore the block which contains your transaction was produced by the good miners and not the bad guys I use  crypto com  https   crypto com  to buy SOL and transfer it to  sollet io  https   sollet io   Main advantage is the waived 2 99  credit card fee in the first 30 days  Referral link for 25    https   crypto com app pgwp6en7u9 I see  So it s like there s a 99  chance your transaction is confirmed in the first block but it s not guaranteed and each confirmation exponentially decreases the chance of a rolling back your transaction Isn t this not a big deal in a practical sense except for centralized exchanges who book keep because if your transaction got rolled back you would just get your money back Lol dude is a larp it s obvious tbh https   github com certusone wormholeYeah it s in the works  Not operational  but if you want to check out the GUI www wormholebridge com In theory  I believe the Polygon validators could launch a wormhole network that s compatible with the Solana BSC ETH Terra wormhole   Earlier this year  I was hopeful Matic would expedite interoperability between chains  We ll see what happens  but I think it s fair to say that what you re wishing for would be impractical for both parties right now solDate How do you buy it  I only have coinbase Or Solana for 10 normally that something that will happen with plutowork lol I know ur lying because any1 with 32 ETH to stake would not custody them with CoinBase lmfao I think the wormhole is in the works Hell they could 10x and be cheaper than Eth Why would I need that  when I already live in the Netherlands In bought 32 eth to stake in march 2020 and then sold them to buy sol instead of locking them up on CB indefinitely until Eth 2 0 comes out which is honestly the dumbest thing I have ever heard of  Imagine locking up your money for 6  for an indefinite amount of time  Better off with a CD Why  Can already wrap Eth on Raydium  Eth shills really need to leave this sub Yeah it was next to the dogecoin listing  and I was like hmm this is interesting  Now it s gone  Did it not meet liquidity NVM  Works now  I did not do anything to make it work again    Thanks Hi  yes I run Shinobi Systems   Unfortunately I can t do anything about issues with Solflare  but I have DM d LeGrandCharles and will help in whatever way I can Strange  Did you try ctrl f5  Or f12  right click refresh button and press  empty cache and hard reload im thinking the same thing too  polygon solana bridge will be huge Wouldn t  happen with out dot I can t even keep up anymore the solana store needs some women friendly gear Go shill somewhere else  sorry OP don t know if there s a bridge since I just bought mine with straight ETH Wouldn t you need Solana to buy Raydium to begin with  AFAIK regular USDT USDC is Eth based  not the same one as circulating on Solana network no you should check solanax  built on the solalna blockchain   solanax org  https   solanax org Spread the word  solanax  new bull on a run  you heard it here first  built on solana blockchain  the fastest blockchain there is  be the first  don t miss out  solanax org where can i buy Tulip and Solape Was curious myself  Takes less than 5 minutes to open on FTX if you don t want to pass the KYC  Then transfer from coinbase some ETH or BTC and buy with that on FTX   Pretty straightforward Blockfolio  App needs some work though I use the Solflare wallet  As someone who has never used a crypto wallet outside of coinbase  there was some time invested in figuring everything out  But it s not too difficult and it works well  You can test it out with small transactions first Please stop with these fake news  they re listed on Raydium as we speak wtf Ya know  massive hacks that cripple our economy like the one that just happened to colonial pipeline  If communication and programs had a proof of history through a double encoded time stamp  you d be able to tell if there was any tampering with the code thanks for getting the right info out there  i m staked with exodus at a false 10   how do you stake with one of the validators on the list  what wallet needs to be used yes yes same i claimed 40  of my tokens but    you can swap or buy this shit token  no i dont think valuye   0 Eth will definitely have some pricing concern when it comes to EIP1559   Most people are pointing to to deflationary nature of it and are forgetting about it s somewhat drastic change in business model   The big difference for ETH is that they are already a snowball rolling down the mountain   SOL s value case is their differentiation  which I hope works out for them  I own a lot  Also  almost anyone can run an ETH node  which is perfect for subsequent adoption   SOL s nodes are rather significant undertakings in a relative sense Just tell us you can t afford 1 ETH so u look for the  next big thing   lol Gas fees are 2 cents but there are only 10 tokens to trade on raydium It s actully around 5 bucks rn Thanks  I need to move on  My fault entirely I read 1000 times not to share my seed phrase and still did it  shame on me How are u sure  Today i claimed my tokens One thing crypto can achive is that immediatly after you used something of one utility you get billed and automaticly paid  You know exactly what you used and dont have to pay upfront  This is easier for the provider toi MacOS was superior tech to Windows  but you know how it ended up And if superior tech is what you are looking for  Algorand is probably better than Solana So I prefer to have a stake in everything  I can t be sure what will succeed and what not Same problem trying to create a staking account on my Ledger Nano X  Very disappointing to see that this issue is still open after 60  days  Anyone know if SOL is available immediately after unstaking or is there a delay Long run superior tech will win and current marketing will not matter   The one that is best for developers to build on will win  They will tell the institutions  they are the real adaptation power  And right now they are on ETH  nothing really has changed last few months in this  Some opportunists always try to build on alternatives but their reasoning is speculative   try to be the first on up and coming tech  They are not choosing the best tool for the job With that said  SOL has promise  I would not keep more than 4  of your ETH value on SOL though u ZantetsuLastBlade2 happens to run that validator but afaik the validator doesn t have anything to do with the stake not confirming  Also I know that Plaid is a real company that does bank account validation services for Blockfolio and FTX but I ve never heard of Paid  Sorry man https   atomicwallet io  should support sol tokens as well but its not supported on Raydium  etc  now  I have been using web sollet so far Marking this Lol We need more saviours like you You can DM the seed to me  i will check for you with the solana devs  s It looks like its back up now According to their  twitter  https   twitter com openserum lang en   openserum is  A community ran project  In practical terms  I think their link all the markets on their UI whereas the official Serum seems to have some criteria to list only  safer  assets Sol summer szn is happening I discussed the matter with one of the moderators in Telegram but he could not do anything  The scammer impersonates a real support guy  And this time I just blocked him right away You may DM me his username there  if you like  i might report him to telegram  amp  tell others to do the same  at least they block his account Found it thanks so much  Nice to see some people can help others  by the way the same guy tried to scam me again as I asked some updates in the Telegram channel At least I learnt my lesson and block him right away https   solana com ecosystem categories exchange Many DeFi platforms on Ethereum now support Polygon Matic which is very cheap  I think Ethereum will be fine  their ecosystem is by far the most well developed Solana is great  but it s still an outsider  As of now it s impossible to know if there will be a winner in the smart chain race or if all will coexist   Solana is great  but it looks a little weak on marketing  Cardano may not be better than Solana on a technologic stand point  but they are doing a great job at marketing the platform and getting deals with institutions  Large scale adoption is what is going to make a difference in the end Go to    welcome   channel  amp  choose a role by clicking on the right emoji that suits your needs  let s start with the Community emoji for example   all other channels will be open I only have   welcome  how do add the SolFlare support channel pls FTX US That s what I did and got scammed but you are right  I was just f stupid to react to DM  The real guy is helping me now  Thank you  Hope at least my experience will help others not fall into the PAID Network trap I ll better redirect you to SolFlare    Telegram    https   t me SolFlare_Wallet  or    Solana Discord    https   discord com invite pquxPsq   better option imo       post your problem in details there in    support solflare   channel I went through the staking process on SolFlare  Created my account  sent some SOL  created a stake account and then tried to delegate to one Validator called  Shinobi   All went well until the confirmation step where the  delegation  transaction is processed I have now had a message for hours  Confirming transaction  please do not close the window  with the transaction ID  I presume  attached at the bottom  Cannot see it though on Solana Beach I logged a 2nd time to check into Solfalre and it all seems normal  My SOL are in the stake account and not yet delegated  However I guess the above transaction is stuck and I have no idea what to do  cancel it  amend it but how and what for   Maybe I can just close the window  leave it there or try to delegate again but will it be stuck again  same issue or stuck behind the first transaction    A bad day for me  scammed and issue not solved  I appreciate the messages all I m pretty sure it s coming since it entered in the top30  I m investing since it barely entered the top50  We still have large room to grow Let me know what s the problem  if we can help you out in here we ll do that  if not i ll direct you to the right Discord   Telegram channels if you like it s all cool man  appreciate how humble you are when you apologized twice  I totally appreciate that  you re a great add to this whole Solana community Shinobi something Bilaxy exchange Yes You mean which validator I chose Where did you stake OK sorry again for the accusation  I guess I m on a roll tonight with the bad accusations I m going to take a step back and check myself   I need to chill a bit  I promise to do so Thank you I have been too naive  Another golden rule Is never give away your seed phrase  knew it though  I still face an issue with Solana  would you know the best place to get support from the Solana team  Solana forum What exactly is the problem you mean it could solve Send one of your coins to ChangeNow and change to SOL  then send your Sol to Exodus or Atomic Wallet Finally able to farm my Tulips   i like the price action too That s fine then  Some big projects will however get launched at BocaChica from now as Solana Hapi made some agreements in that regard  Many from the Hackaton event for example and also the winner there  So if you like good IDO projects   Solana there is a chance you will be drawn to BocaChica anyway    The partnership is quite thorough because it seems to me that right from  of before  Hapi project starting Solana got a top place on their roadmap  CEO of the company behind Hapi and Head Dev of Hapi were both part of the jury in the hackaton event Upcoming months Hapi will prepare their security protocol in terms of features and compatibility for solana adopting it fully  Hapi is also moving away from ethereum to solana  This seems all part of that partnership so there must be something to gain for both parties here PS  I m not a developer of part of the team  Just someone that went all in on this project and did before that THOROUGH research hodling solana since it was 8  in value  no intention of selling before I see the coin in the top three of the market cap  i have retirement plans on sol  D The question we all want answers to  I ve been reading that alt season is over  But idk Rule number  1    if he DMs you first then it s probably 101  plain SCAM All Mods   Community Managers will have that     I Won t PM You First     into their Bio for a reason   Rule number  2    Never forget Rule number  1 So sorry for your loss This is a good post  it should be pinned so people know the real APY from now on ansi09 might have missed 50  of the answer  ZantetsuLastBlade2 gave the 100  of the answer  Thanks both of you  I m learning something new about the APY    never thought it s so complicated while those wallets or validators pretending  lying to be accurate  they are given us 10  APY bla bla bla Sometimes it s cheap  sometimes you have to pay extremely high fees per transaction on Eth  Just look at what fees I paid for swapping USDT to Kishu  more than  700  https   i postimg cc GmxfFMmv A3 D3 E2 FD E581 4161 86 A5 6 F1537 FED4 C3 jpg Solana store     checkout with paypal    cmon guys So translated from mental gymnastics  eth 2 0 launched in beta to devs on  mainnet   Vitalik said the other day its not coming until at least Dec 2022  He also said that its not due to technical problems and is due to people problems  which if true is worse the technical problems  The real truth is all the talent left Consys in 2017 to work on Ada  Polkadot  etc or left crypto entirely  Sharding and layer 2 are like the Sega gensis expansion roms versus the PSX Cdrom  50k tps versus 15 tps today and like 100 theoretically when   if Eth 2 0  Anyone who has used Solana defi and seen the speeds and low fees would have to mentally ill to keep using Eth  Just wait until SBF and FTX tokenize the entire stock market  Ethereum is toy technology compared to the ACTUAL performance of Solana  Even the theoretical performance and scalability of Eth 2 0  Dot  Ada whatever is peanuts compared to Solanas actual performance  All the arguments about Solana being not decentralized are baseless or rely on changing the definition of the word decentralized too  Thinking layer 2 will save Eth is like putting NOS in a Honda Civic  its still a 4 cylinder  If it works its just because the layer 2 isn t actually a Dex its just a centralized exchange  Id consider holding some BTC in addition to my Sol as it actually makes some sense as  digital gold  but even then the inflation rate of Sol will eventually be 1   V1  Btc  LitecoinV2  Ethereum V3  Eth 2 0  Ada  Dot  AtomV4  Solana Boca chica will have a token but its non tradable   its only value is getting into the idos  We know more about the token  and the launchpad shortly   There s a second medium article coming out very soon  Keep ya eyes posted here or come to the hapi tg and join anoucment channel Trade for usdc on raydium Gas fees are less than 2 cents on Raydium Serum always For this one  I tried to add some music and a subscribe to cover up my little mess up at the start  My mind was so looking forward to telling you about the Tulip Farm that is coming that I couldn t say Discord  Still  I hope you can overlook that and make sure you check out SolFarm if you are on Solana  I am sure that most of you are already doing that  Thanks again to the team for supporting me with those tokens from the last videos I made  I think I will be able to show off that I got some of us into this project early      The Tweet  https   twitter com RaydiumProtocol s     Solfarm Discord  https   discord gg N9K4kW89wR  Solfarm Site  https   solfarm io   Raydium Site  https   raydium io fusion I have not heard of them  But what you mentioned are typical of a scam You should do more research on the name before committing That s a good post  thanks  I wanted to know that too Sorry  it was me  i was trying to upvote your post  may be i missed the right arrow What I don t get is that Paid network is everywhere on Twitter and so on and it all looks legit Wanted to get in before it being listed on coinbase and potentially catch that wave Definitely no no Treat it as an expensive lesson Yes gas fees are like  2 rn  Sunday nights Thank you so I lost everything and should not pay any more cent correct gt you downvoted meI down voted nothing   i m not 10 years old  gt APY is NOT THE SAME IN THE WHOLE SOLANA NETWORK  Even if every validator set the exact same commission  APY would not be the same across all of themYES  aware of this part  was bad for me not to mention   explain that part like you did  Bravo  just have mercy on my soul lol  Looking for your good posts   answers   help for this community of course Glad we have you there in Discord  amp  in here for sure man Very uninformed  ETH 2 0 launched December 2020 to main net  but to devs not users Layer 2 solutions are here  Arbitrum launched last week expect user onboarding in the next month  hello 99  gas reductions  goodbye SolanaJK I believe in a multi chain future  Defi will on Ethereum  Sol will find its use cases Thank you for the apology  it means a lot  We do learn a lot from you  i personally do in Discord   amp  the Solana community in here  amp  i personally appreciate all the good posts   answers   help you give to the community in here  You make technical stuff so easy to digest by the average Joe like myself  Just your attitude was just a lil bit harsh hehe Cheers
2021-06-08,38.25126869,42.47828958,33.6854604,so you can t stake sol on ftx us I d sell everything for hbar imo I disagree  I think BTC is the most secure crypto as it requires the most amount of energy to do a 51  attack  I think it s the best store of value crypto and with the lightning network  sending it around will be much faster while retaining the high security  Also the fact that it has no public creator as satoshi is anonymous means it is way more socially decentralised where it has no central figure who could have power over the network  If BTC kept going down I think it would be very detrimental to the rest of crypto And maybe some trannies Yes  that s the safest  Timing the market is very difficult unless you re really well networked and do it as a full time job Thank you  Yeah none of us had done rust before  Thankfully though  we were able to use  token lending  https   github com solana labs solana program library tree master token lending  as a base  so we could focus on the frontend and interactions with the program SolMate      you should be rewarded from the company Agreed  I said it  might  die  And I m talking a really long time span 5  years  I hope it doesn t and yes I like the idea of solana and ethereum being interoperable short answer  Whales want our money   long answer  https   www youtube com watch v ltcnTTeDFjY Ohhhh I see what you mean  and yeah it does rise rhe question of why   but perhaps it s just to get their eggs in multiple baskets  no pun intended on that one actuslly haha   and to just really stretch out among all markets  What will host All Types of Dapps IMO   SOLANA    Eth will host dapps where you can meet up to talk about eth  2 0    tell me not lol SOL I mean legit any dapp on the chain is evidence of scalability at this point haha  Lately I ve just been more curious about how the tokenomics of these chains should or shouldn t impact the suite of dapps that live on them so that s where my question was mainly coming from  Like will we see specific categories of dapps living on ethereum or Solana  for example  Kinda fun to think about Heyhey  really nice job  I m just a bit jelly that I didn t manage to spare some time for the Solana hackathon due to my day job  I ll be watching closely for updates Can we use those phones for something like sms verification  stuff like that  Would be great though  Can you confirm this  If this is not the situation  i can t see the benefit of this to be honest Stay away from Futures trading if you want to keep your money Sell wall looks thin now  so it means we may boom anytime if just BTC have mercy on us Hold SOL  You may want to diversify a   of your SOL but why move it to Bitcoin  Why not ETH  ADA  MAT or etc Also   its not as though this takes away from any other area or diminishes speeds of the block chain elsewhere   so again  what s it matter and isn t it just more evidence of scalability Alright   I ll play   riddle me this  did we  need  an egg shaped Reece s candy  No not really  Are they fun and delicious   YessssDoes a dating app both need the fastest possible speed and be built on solana    maybe not  but clearly the devs said  let s Reece s egg this bitch and launch a dating app  Fuck it I think you re missing my point but I love that you re in the curl of the hype wave  truly  My point was more that Solana s blockchain is lauded for its amazing transaction speeds  but a dating DApp doesn t need insane amounts of speed because its use cases are so simple  Either way   huge fan of Solana I am seeing these post a lot lately  Just follow btc You are causing the price to drop  Fuxking future paper bois that liquidate makes it even worse Solana literally has a  break solana  sim on their site that can t be done  This dude tryna act like they broke sol lmaaooooo get out What I m so confused will someone explain this fiasco    I just read all those tweets and not sure who did what to who   bullish as all hell on SOL tho  More so after  this gt 	Even if the data project is a cover up for setting up algos to pump the price  I m fine with that This doesn t make any sense Bro this must have been a hell of a job  It looks fantastic  In the challenges  learning rust  I can only imagine  Goddamn  excellent work Well BTC simply has no real use value  It s pure speculation  From P2P money it has become billionaires  favorite gamble  Plus the ESG narrative is here to stay and will have a huge impact That s the entire point dude  we re shifting the whole world into blockchain technolog by the next decade or so   That s the plans coz its crypto Trump opened his mouth is why it s down Don t get involved with futures if you don t have vast experience  You can win 10 times in a row  But 1 loss can cost you everything Yes  it s inflationary   That s how validators get paid as the network grows   Eventually inflation will drop to 1 5  minus the deflationary forces of transaction fee burn  which if there are as many transactions as there should be by that point   10 years from now   may take effective inflation down to a very small amount  possibly even zero Inflation doesn t exist for you if you remain staked in Solana   Just keep that in mind   Staked SOL is inflation proof  it gets staking returns greater than the inflation rate    of course  if you look at it that way  then you have to understand that your staking returns are really only 2    3    But if inflation bothers you to think about  then just cut 5 5  out of your staking returns and pretend that there is no such thing as inflation Is SOL being listed on Korbit  Could this be related Don t buy an amount that can get you liquidated in this market  it s that simple BTC is doing what it needs to do  We are all tied to BTC price action  Just Hodl and dollar cost average  We are in the Wyckoff accumulation phase  If you believe in Solana and it s fundememtals then don t worry  Take a long term perspective When did it reach 47 Btc crashed Most data on blockchains is public HLOD Cool     Eeeeeeeee The TV SOL BTC chart interplay is so gorgy Didn t see any SAMO on raydium nor on Serum Dex so far  Only Bonafida dex   Go to their discord channel if interested  there are all announcements I wonder what SOL price would have been at this point if the May crash never happened  Seems SOL is doing alright despite all the downturns  But what if I just read that on Lark Davis Twitter feed It came out more than a year after the Solana white paper Idk how you can group SNX and SHIB Buy heaps of blow SOL summer is coming Never  I will HODL for long time I usually have no trouble accessing my legder wallet  but now I can t access it   After selecting the derivation path it has trouble loading addresses   It says my ledger device is ineligible   I have the ledger app open and I have the latest ledger firmware installed and the latest Solana app   Any thoughts Won t have to worry about rugpulls on Sol  have you looked into HAPI by bonafida  It s a trust less Oracle ON CHAIN CYBERSECURITY PROTOCOL WITH TRUSTLESS ORACLES PREVENTING HACKER ATTACKS It s the difference between the old web and the new  decentralization and privacy  Our data will belong to us  It s more secure  It s really an exciting future But they are diamond handed 1 Because any girlWho is bullish on SOL is bae and I wanna find her Why does anything need to be on a blockchain  For decentralization and privacy  Do you want the intricate details about your dating preferences  the way that you talk about yourself  the way you converse with potential partners  etc   all to be sold  Because that s what happens on dating apps   honestly  dating apps are  exactly  the kinds of services to be on blockchains  Everything should  really  and I believe it will be one day actually  SOLmate is still in development   date came first For what it s worth   I read the link   Approximately the same time  is  NOT  the same as proof of history   laser beam specific consensus clock  So there you have it You re the most correct person on this sub at the moment Long haul probably good time to buyq  short term not sure  I have a few long term investments already  For me to be interested long term with sol I need to see a bit more  To me SOL is just advertising their niche even though it s not all that important  It reminds me of NANO zero fees  ALGO is almost 0 and does much much more and is also more resilient to spam attacks  SOL has the fastest transaction speeds  yes  but somewhat like NANO  SOL had to sacrifice security for speed  SOL speed is threatening it s decentralization  They also have lower transaction confirmations than ALGO and STELLAR etc  Which means if you deposit SOL and ALGO onto kraken at the same time  ALGO would be instant and SOL would take an avg 2 minutes  ALGO is centralized therefore lacking security as well  so if SOL follows suit then ALGO will be the better bet Slow means secure and decentralized  If SOL can stay decentralized  They have plans to keep it decentralized with projects  delegating it s data storage  I want to see if they work before I get in  It will still be plenty early by then  Also the best time to get into a coin long term is during a bear market  We either just started one not long ago but it s still too early to tell  I personally don t think we are ETH is threatening their decentralization and security with 2 0  DOT has the same problem as well  want speed  but also want security  Again if ETH does this and SOL finds a way to stay decentralized  I will be all in on SOL  It s just not worth the chance right now as it has SOO much upside if it stays decentralized ADA has a unique way to solve the speed and security issue  but again they are in their infancy  Wait and see approach  ADA  DOT  and SOL are definitely my top picks to be scalable  decentralization  and secure  Many people don t care about security or decentralizion as well  But they also don t care if it takes 1 second or 10 seconds   SOL s speed argument is a bit overrated  That s why ALGO n Stellar are doing well  Banks will just have it insured and end users won t be affected     It s tough to pick out here but like I said I m already locked in on some long term investments I believe in  Short term I m looking for projects releasing soon  THETA FUEL  and advertising that has gone up a notch recently  ALGO  as well as other news to pick some short term winners You can get phone numbers of people around the world What exactly is the purpose of this site  like the reasons behind this I like both strategy s  I do believe in the project  The second point is hard to do  I have tried to time the market and have had no success  In fact if I went and sold right now the bull market would return  Lol  The only strategy that works for me is try and buy low  Dollar cost average and hold Will I find someone with whom I can share my private keys with on SolDate FTX US  https   ftx us  a 5288980  is your best option What is worth explaining if it has nothing to do with the advancement of SOLANA   what does it matter what Poh Is similar or isn t similar to  Wanna talk about just Poh and it s function for SOL  Sure  Wanna talk about pointless shit   Not me Will anyone ever legitimately ask you for your seed phrase  My assumption is no At least I got my sanity back and did not make things even worse Couldn t agree more This is pretty low grade If you re that upset by the question you should explain why to the person who s trying to learn lol Yes i agree with that Serum  amp  Raydium owns most of the RPC nodes on the network  Serum s one is used by so many dApps  so some people use Raydium s one  which can barely run their IDOs etc as it is  From launch to now  theyve buffered it 10x  https   raydium medium com 100 days of raydium 453863c684f6     Causes trouble  overloading RPC nodes is the current bottleneck of the solana ecosystem I guess variety lol  We always talk about the endless possibilities of blockchain technology and how it will change the world but our applications of blockchain and Decentralisation has been limited to only the realm of finance mainly  As corny as this shit seems a wide variety of projects can show just how vast the potential of Sol is Just because you understand yourself doesn t mean you are communicating clearly  No need to be rude That s what Iv been saying this whole time  JFC did u read any of my comments And btw running your own node is definitely skin in the game Ahh ok  yeah man this is super unclear  But keep downvoting me I m just saying a lot of rich folk that I know don t use anything else  That s just reality  also  running a node isn t  skin in the game  unless you actually build something with it  otherwise the strategy is just as simplistic as  number go up   so it may as well be limited to Coinbase building a business on chain  building dapps and games and services on chain  actually using the networks is having skin in the game It s alright  i now you don t mean anything bad  but w need to keep a minimum quality posting in here  amp  give the right info so we don t create panic   FUD or misleading info or stuff like that  His tweet seems fine though  nothing implies that they cut them off because  of the network congestion or anything like that  Solana team has the right to take the best decision they think it s the best for the whole network  He should ve been more professional  imo  not to disclose stuff like that in Twitter  pro business stuff shouldn t be done this way I can get a few BTC with my SOL  I ll trim a little when it s 14 to be honnest i took this thread from a french forum  and just translate it to get more serious answer and I did not verify everything  sorry about that I was nibbling at  SOL earlier this year based on tech  but as I learned more and more about Star Atlas  I knew Solana truly has a killer app in the pipeline  If the money the game studio has raised  many of which through mind blowing NFT sales  is any indication  the game will be an epic experience  Merging the dopamine of top tier gaming with that of gambling  treasure hunting  and the metaverse    boom gt the developers cut them off access to the nodes after an hour and asked them to stop   because the network was saturated  I can t see anything in his tweet  the one you brought in the OP  that says     because the network was saturated      No idea what s your point by adding something like that  that doesn t exist in that Tweet  you brought yourself   Or may be that s just your assumption why they cut them off Thanks for the answer  really interesting I d be interested in knowing if they re talking about transactions or RPC queries  I haven t seen evidence that there is a transaction bottleneck  although the network is still in beta so not technically release ready   However I know there have been some developers who refuse to set up their own RPC nodes and expect to overwhelm the existing ones instead  so they get blocked or such I think we should increase gas fee 1  Buy Litecoin on Coinbase  LTC has very cheap transfer fees 2  Send Litecoin to FTX  use  this ref link  https   ftx com  a lardnicus  for 5  off your fees 3  Sell Litecoin on FTX for USDC4  Use USDC to buy SOL5     6  Profit Optional step  send to Exodus wallet and easily stake it for 10 4  apy and get even more SOL in your sleep And that s what I call not having skin in the game  Having your coins never leave exchange is the biggest sign of someone with little experience  Self custody and cold storage is the safest bet when playing with a numbers like 32 ETH U can t run your own validator node from Coinbase lol If it does even half as well as Ethereum it would put 1 SOL at  600 Lol no  Obviously we are all invested in SOL  I have a fat bag  I got the raydium airdrop  And have been using the ecosystem often  If u re read the thread I was just saying it s immature compared to ETH  And you would be naive to think it s on the same level at this point  I know reading is not everyone s best skill so I understand the confusion You d be surprised    I know a lot of rich folk who have massive bags that have never left coinbase ok I bought 3500 SolApes  I guess if this place ends up turning into another BNB casino they will come in handy I don t get arguments like this lol what are you saying   don t buy now while it s still being built up  wait till it s mature and expensive ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️  ‍ ️ Why are you guys debating the current numbers of SOL vs ETH that s like pointing to a farm that has lots and lots of crops and then pointing at the new farm with little sprouts and saying   Seee seeee no where near    But then flash forward to further in the cycle of those farms and you ll see the sprouts are now flush flourish beauriful crops and the other first farm is overgrown and has bugs and expensive to clean up SOL   WillPrevail all  And more and more people will move over once they realize their money is better here and stop paper trading with their mortgage in transaction fees There is no rebuttal  he s right  But that s why it s a great time to buy   The alternative to buying in early is what     waiting for it mature and go to  1000 and then buy  lol Doesn t matter  Download Metamask mobile and just see how advanced the ecosystem is   It s not a zero sum game  Eth doesn t need to fail for Solana to succeed  Both can succeed I think ETH has some massive infrastructure already built on it I don t think it will die  I do still hold hope they will address the mining and gas issues    But that said it s not a zero sum game here    Both can coexist to cater to different markets  and can even help each other  I think having the wormholes and being able to support Ethereum assets on Solana out of the box was a master stroke    It essentially makes Solana the best Ethereum layer 2 option around  and that will allow users to experience the native features Omg such facts Will you make a SAMO trading pair on raydium       half kidding but fr us Americans can t get on the FTx site   but raydiumWorks  I been checking daily lol I How can they afford a 10  apy with such low profit  Noob question Realistically and objectively  if we could sum up the two most important general strategies in the long scheme of things  it would be these two 1  If you truly believe in the project  you re hodling until full adoption  ignoring bear and bull markets  Fiat money will eventually die out and be greatly devalued to the point that selling would be like selling gold for a ton of peanuts  It wouldn t make sense  That might could take 5 to 15 years 2  If you are a knowledgeable trader who has the guts and the time to invest in the market  then you keep your alts until you realize that the bear market is upon us  You sell them for BTC or stablecoins and you buy again when we reach bottom  This cycle continues until you feel you have so much money that you don t even care about bears anymore Hold Another 2 5 eth lol holy shit that s nerve Buy bitcoin on exodus wallet app then exchange for Sol Dude ur a Larp  You know what that is Never selling my SOL Why not go 50 50 Can you read I said I sold them and bought Sol I bought at  49 I ain t freaking out  Solana will be a great value  Just hold With you on SOL  Just not with you on any hate for ETH  and I don t understand the bull case for BTC  It gets outperformed by cash in a bear market and eth and pretty much every alt in a bull market  All the cool stuff is being built on ethereum  The even cooler stuff  CLOB for examole  that require more speed and cheaper transactions is being built on Solana and the scalability issue is already solved Ethereums biggest issue  scalability    eth2  claims to solve some of it but is taking way to long and we will see if it ever works Solanas biggest issue  acquiring users and devs creating products that attract them  This is quickly getting better but the UI of SRM and Ray  needs to improve and we need more flagship daaps that attract new users   I think Solana and Ethereum could co exist untill the end of time but Solana has more upside because it has so far done a better job solving the scalability issue which is required for mainstream adoption  Ethereum so far has done a better job attracting users but part of that is first mover advantage Solana 2 trillion in 5 years Agreed  It s got to be a business decision based on market conditions  They are beholden to their shareholders and board how about yield farming using SOL pair LPs Maybe they were talking about the very last update in the ETH 2 0 roadmap being complete by then  ETH 2 0 is a loose collection of updates  all with different timelines  some of which have shipped already or are shipping soon Lower fees  free withdrawals  support for the Solana ecosystem  This is the way Not an expert at all and don t know to much about eth2 0 but pretty sure the devs were talking about it being finished or near that point Solana 100  by August What s the origin of these pit viper shades im definitely out of the loop What part of eth 2 0 are you talking about  Part of it is already live  part of it is still in the pipeline Tell that to the guy who bought at  58 when he could of bought at  20  You can be long on something and still get 1000  gains over 350 Again super rude   I am personally developing dapps on Solana  hbu I guess I got lucky then Does anyone know  I made a miserable mistake of swapping the names of my xCOPE and my COPE  I want to delete xCOPE Yeah  my guess is that they re stalling because under current market conditions  they know they wouldn t hit their volume fee projections that justified the initial announcement Also  I m not exactly sure how this plays into the current situation  but  DEXes on Solana specifically have been on Coinbase s radar for a while     https   www coindesk com coinbase defi us regulations dex competition FTX all the fucking way  fucking A right so      did you sold all you SOL back then   D june 2021  LOLZ I think you are seeing that your address is not valid because Kraken doesn t support withdrawals of USDC on the Solana network You could swap your SOL for USDC through Phantom wallet or go trade it using Serum I m earthing earthling Limit order could indicate a buy not a sell  Dollar cost average my friend Yes of course  FTX support USDC ERC20 AFAIK Golden rule  always use small amount for testing before sending the whole sum I was waiting for 32 but never came To me  it doesn t make sense to tell someone to be  long  on something but then warn them with an implication that you could get a bad price Cheers man  best band in the game  re  price  my bias leans towards a larger market correction and sidewards grind over the coming 3 4 months with ETH SOL and others aligned with DeFi  besides BTC  leading to the upside on the other side  I have limit orders in at 20  12  and 4 bump  I am also very interested in this answer what do you think is a good buying price  also  I love your username  I am a big fan of rufus Thad be alright  I was guessing for sure over  100 I don t think we ll get an answer for it  which makes me think it s solely based on market performance Invest in a ledger  they are about 100USd and safer long term holds   Otherwise you are just in a hot wallet   SOlFlare and Ledger are pretty straight forward and as easy as staking via Yoroi Probably  200 by the end of the year  Here is a ref link  https   cryptocurrencypriceprediction com solana coin price prediction Can you receive erc20 usdc in ftx and send it out as spl usdc I haven t tried it out yet  but there is a project on Github that looks potentially useful called  SerumTaxTime  for exporting Serum trades  It looks like it was created for the hackathon  I don t think that gets you any transactions relating to farming staking rewards  LP  etc   but it s a start Hopefully the community continues to work on these kinds of tools    they are sorely needed Hey  New to SOL but not crypto  Finding it to be a very nice token  I m also into Ada  I hear a lot of hype for Ada possibly reaching  10 this year  What about SOL  Any guesses on where it ll go this year  It s rocking right the F out as far as I m concerned Me   Never  Lol  Really tho  I don t know if that will happen or not but I do believe in the fundememtals of SOL Not nearly as much percentage wise though Nice  I m glad I found this group  SOL is my fav new crypto  Bought it on the 2nd dip few weeks back and have been very impressed with its performance so far  Barely even dipped with the past 24hr dips  Now I find out I can stake it too so giddy up missed the boat   sideways market for the next 3 4 months Can they let us know at the same time as all of their friends and staff this time There is no Solana versus Ethereum  Solana is building out specifically to capture the high frequency trading market and perhaps gaming  Speed and settlement  To take on the network effects of Ethereum at this point with a  450M war chest   SOL token treasury   SBF Alameda FTX behind them will not be enough  That said  this is fundamentally different than EOS or TRON trying to upseat Ethereum back in 2017  Solana is coming in with a real value proposition so a long SOL position is prudent  barring you get in at the right price of course great thanks  Dont have a Phantom wallet and apparently there is a waitlist I recently switched to  FTX us  https   FTX us  from cb pro and love it Anybody know the real cause of the delays Yes  Hope you didn t buy into a bs  eth killer  narrative Thanks   just sold some more ETH to buy more SOL  I think at this point I am 75  in SOL and 25  in other coins  Let s gooo Eth   Don t you even know what SOL is I agree in the solana podcast one the devs said we aren t trying to kill eth but be a good alternative to it until eth2 0 comes out which is a few years off  The toxic I will never own BTC again  ETH is a much better question Yup solved it  use Phantom wallet as proxy and connect ledger through that  And it works So weird how only Solflare works by connecting directly to ledger Solana is now passed Bitcoin cash and nipping at the heels of Uniswap Dj jBjeujib bb1   j jjnBv did you find a solution  i have exactly the same issue  would love to know the solution  Contacted raydium through telegram to no avail Reported trlr  solana summer Nice No amount of funding can buy network effects  I like solana but the eth killer argument is getting old Ki Tribalism has reached the crypto world You must be fun at parties Bad bot Nice  are you guys planning to release a governance token like Aave Hopefully this will happen soon  Sending SOL is a great experience Good read Exodus is basically zero risk and the APY isn t bad at all  Correct me if I m wrong though  I m just setting it and forgetting it  I have earned half a SOL already Curious where the liquidity comes from Assuming we re entering a bear market  which we probably are  stick to USDT and BTC Was on sale Atomic wallet Can you buy coins for these new dapps already It would be a nice combination strengthen  both of them long term for sure I was at home writing comments on reddit Chain link doesn t have a reliable institutional grade market data Thanks   That s not an option on Binance US  unfortunately I stake on binance  But I m pretty new to that topic tbh Addresses are public  yes  but  and admittedly I don t know anything about this platform  theoretically the  dating  data would be private and at the very least could not be sold the way our data is now Solana validator nodes need to be really beefy to handle the TPS  and my understanding is that RPC nodes have to be even faster because they also have to handle requests  So it s actually pretty expensive to build and run RPC nodes  This is one of Solana s weaknesses at the moment  However  I d think if someone is trying to stand up a multi million dollar dApp they d also be willing to invest in this infrastructure I will probably jinx it  But despite the massive dip  SOL isint doing too bad  But we will see I think you are confusing yourself  Serum doesn t have a front end  it s entirely back end  the only front end that serum had was the serum swap page which you are referring to  Any app can plug into serum directly  such as raydium orca bonfida  and provide a GUI  front end that the user sees   So you ll notice that all these applications have swaps  But really they are mostly using serum on the backend  So    serumswap  the page you are referring to  decided to stop providing recourses to it since 1  Everyone was using raydium 2  Serumswap didn t use serum  ironically  and raydium does So it s a no brainer to deprecate it But why are swaps disabled on Raydium now Yeah but AAX is pushing forward so hard so i really belive we see higher prices in this year gt  solo dev builds a fully decentralized binary options market with 400ms settlementCrypto is amazing For me  SOL all the way  But I m buying now because I believe SOL will have massive gains in the future  ETH you may get some small gains for this bull run no it doesnt  either unstake and restake with the full SOL to earn again  which takes minimum 2 epochs   or just open up a seprate stake account Imagine if we didn t have this BTC sell off  The price would be jumping up https   projectserum medium com serum srm and the ecosystem part 1 2742f6a24597 Huh  Please ELI5 ETH or Sol You have to unstake and restake Go to an eth sub jfc The FBI hacked Colonial Pipeline then turned over their own wallet WOhoo this is amazing news Thanks for the update Serum swap has been deprecated  They gave a  hats off  to raydium for making a better swap engine  So they would rather use the recourses elsewhere Ohh    I see had no idea about that  Thank you That s all super helpful to know thank you  Wish comments in this subreddit could be gilded somehow Wyckoff and Whales know the words is out to the masses   They prefer quantitative shorts with less returns  So they are hitting hard to catch people not read in raydium is your best friend Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns I succeed to transfer token  send and receive  with Nano S and Mac M1 but I get the same error while I m trying to stack So there isn t a general good way to use them I don t think you understood the question Oh I m not the developer  I got the link from YouTube  It just auto loaded on Reddit Check out his Twitter for more info awesome work  do you plan to continue working on this project Huh  What use is this sub Reddit if it isn t to have discussions about particular topics  Governance in any crypto is a complex and technical topic that deserves a bunch of questions  I m aware they have a website yes  but faster  D It works just like Compound or Aave  There s always some risk in crypto  For Solend it s   Smart contract risk  could get hacked   Liquidation risk  if others are borrowing from your pool and don t pay back  you take the loss  There s an automated liquidation system  but there s always a small chance something goes wrong when the system is stressed  like during a flash crash   Oracle risk  Solend depends on  Pyth  https   pyth network   for oracles  which informs how much you can borrow  when you d get liquidated  etc  If these show the wrong price there could be some issues  In Solend Compound Aave  deposits are pooled  So basically no  you don t have to wait for someone to repay before you can withdraw As for why you d borrow  maybe you don t want to sell your crypto because you believe it ll go up in value  Or you don t want to trigger capital gains  Or you could borrow and sell another token to short  You could also borrow another token  and buy more of the collateral token  this way you go leverage long  There are a bunch of use cases Looking forward to this Please explain  Is it risk free to the lender  because the loan is secured by crypto which you cannot remove until the loan us paid  Why borrow from another  instead of using your own crypto Sick   Well executed  Great demo overview 80  btc20  altsThat s what I try to follow awesome In the short run  you re absolutely right  it will be detrimental  Not having a public creator is actually a limitation as you can see since people like Saylor can distort its original philosophy  In terms of security  well check what Vitalik has to say now on the subject I d love to see that as well  cuz for now polygon has the best farming pairs can someone explain what s the thing with the glasses  haha some of them are relatively new   cuz the majority was announced like 2 weeks ago or more hah ok  first date  then mate xdxd Looks like a nice project  finally lending and borrowing come to Solana  Can t imagine how difficult it was to build something like it  as there is no similar project in the ecosystem yet  good job improving the ecosystem Is this like Aave How difficult expensive are new RPC nodes to set up if it could be a bottleneck So let me get this straight  you buy when the market is substantially up and then you wonder why it dropped after you bought  Do you follow crypto news at all  I have a feeling you re not made for this game  Buy low son  gold  and don t go on Reddit to ask how an ex president might impact the crypto market
2021-06-09,41.27979305,43.9975669,39.36863503,I guess investing in a project with founders that are anonymous will have to be personal decision you make   Certainly understandable not wanting to invest in such projects Unless you have more than  200k to invest in SOL  no And Discord  In their podcast they push Discord quite a bit  The link is below by another user Pay is too low or I would apply Yep pretty sure it means Andressen Horowitz  a top VC  thinks Sol is gonna beat Ethereum Sell and buy a house lol My two favorites tbh Coinbase soon  Maybe tomorrow or next Thursday Crypto com  gate io or KuCoin available in Texas Have a look at Coingecko 256 recommend for smooth working FTX us is good for buying with fiat  You can also exchange other cryptos for it in Exodus wallet without having to do any KYC Thnx  Can I purchase btc on trust wallet then dex to solana 2 3 at  30 still my best performing coin hah As a mainly XRP holder who bought in during the most recent dips  fk you you beautiful ape Ftx Coinbase has delisted Solana  It used to be there  but not anymore Hey bruh  where can I buy solana   Coinbase pro doesn t support it Cool  where can I buy it from  Coinbase doesn t support that  I am in United states I bought mine from Binance US and Blockfolio Where can I buy this please Where did u buy it WSJ is the watershed  Now Fortune  SBF and FTX launching the naming rights for the basketball stadium in Miami last week  The PR steamroller continues  Fantastic Help me out how can I buy it through trust wallet Why not simply buy SOL on Coinbase and wait for them to support staking  It is inevitable  Staking of pooled customer assets is simply too large a revenue stream for them  a public company  to ignore  Definitely the lazy  easy  approach  but I am lazy Same prob today Am tire of asking  Where can I buy solana  I got trust wallet and crypto com would that work That sounds like ICP My stupidity  I saved  2 seed phrases for 2 different  accounts anda tried wrong one 100 times Same problem here on mac osx  with latest nano firmware and app I m working up to it too  Looking forward to it Still though very shady  Might not mean anything but I would feel better if we knew who these people were I am definitely taking the longer route to becoming a Solana millionaire  but I think I ll get there eventually  Nice buy Yeah   I m jealous I am using Exodus  but i am getting this error when i try to stake  I am staking  99 SOL as a test run and wondering if its because i need to meet a minimum    code   32002  message   Transaction simulation failed  Blockhash not found   data    accounts  null  err   BlockhashNotFound   logs      Please contact support exodus com for quick human help Last I checked there are no RPC incentives  If you re outside the US  the Solana Foundation has a program to provide stake to prevent you from losing money on voting costs but if you re in the US you re out of luck what u mean  i also plan to stake it on solflare   binance better  even its on a exchange I finally bought on the dip yesterday Valorous addition would beest  whither didst thee ope a leverage position      I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout Good addition would be  where did you open a leverage position FTX is my favorite too  Great support BTW It will one SOL has to be around 80 dollars to surpass DOT market cap  if dot goes sideways  however surpassing uni shouldn t be hard with how strong sol is at the moment No  50  is burned When I moved my sol to my staking account it took days before it showed up  many other people have had this problem  I successfully staked on solfare for a few weeks before changing to Binance to get a better rate amp  x200B 100  of the transaction fee is burned Why not on FTX the home of Solana  Its very secure fast and have 10  APY We have very strong fundamental  Time will tell Right I got in at 8 dollar with small amount 400 Sol Same  75  SOL  15  DOT  10  MATIC  Staking them all and seeing my sights on 2024 Cardano has 1mil TPS with Hydra  Bye bye Solana commits in last 4 weeks me too    where the hell are they Commits on code repos  How do they count  for example  the private ones Exactly my thoughts  It s clear with Doge as being their biggest failed listing in history what happens when the timing is wrong   I m guessing they have alot more money riding on Solana Raydium with USDC from FTX Could these RPC nodes be run by users and rented or get rewards sort of like validators  In interested in running something like a validator  Can t run one of those because of block fee and I don t have  450k of Sol Would it be possible to make a dapp that does this sort of lock Solfarm does for yield farming You must buy more to bring down your average cost or you will need much higher   gain to get back to even  Assuming you believe in the coin Oh sorry I mean 2021 Fees were higher in 2020   I m talking about fees being lower over the past month  that is  from roughly a month ago to now  Try an ETH transfer today  you ll be surprised Damn  okay thanks for the advice Serum   Raydium being more impressive than anything on Eth yet having a fraction of volume than Uniswap proves my point about users and adoption Serum has more potential than anything on Eth because a decentrialized CLOB could be absolutly massive   Sollet is pretty tragic and it s getting less excusable by the day    Blah blah blah Phantom I know  Solana has nothing remotely close to Aave  Raydium is nothing special I don t know it feels a lot longer then a month  I really don t remember doing a trade in 2020 for anything near  0 72 to be honest  It s more like  15 at least You sound knowledge I just don t understand how the costs are  0 72 Polygon costs less than a penny  too  So does sending an email saying  IOU  to someone  It s all about security trade offs gt  over the past month ish Lol your comment kinda sucks  If someone wants to get assets from matic chain to sol  what s wrong with that True  however polygon is developing a pretty stout defi ecosystem This is what I m missing in life I m worried about SOL out performing and resulting in too much IL  I m in a SRM and RAD farm on solfarm because they tend to move close with one another from my observations  And I get those sweet TULIP rewards Yeah idk tbh  was wondering that myself I would love to find a good single asset pool for SOL  I am currently in a LP with RAD and SRM in solfarm  But haven t found anything with attractive apy for SOL only Just wondering  where is ethereum Idk but I can tell u Anatoly Yakovenko follows pit vipers on Twitter lol I bought most of my SOL in the 22 24 range but I m still a buy now  big time Raydium   Serum are more impressive than anything on Eth I would hold off for now and maybe just yield farm it with Raydium or something else in the meantime  Solflare staking is fickle and scary right now Yup  Figured that out  Thanks i was under the impression staking via Solflare was the preferred method of staking  in combination with a ledger nano hardware wallet     are other people having issues staking with Solflare  I planned to stake my SOL sometime this coming weekend Little update    When I take a look in your safe report I can see no recent outgoing transactions and also there is a balance of Sol in your wallet So what happened here is that there might have been an error when your device tried to broadcast the transaction  but for some reason  it was not broadcasted correctly it could be a momentarily network issue When a transaction has not been broadcasted the funds actually never left your account  but if your wallet is not in sync with the blockchain it can show a balance issue after making a failed transaction in order to fix this  I think we should try refreshing your wallet  This is good to know  SOL continues to be the GOAT  Did i mention light speed customer support   They emailed me back very quickly good  more time to build up our positions Thx  I finally sorted this out  I think I did not make any mistake on first withdraw  but after that I added some confusion to my action  so I could not figure out what was stucked  I think the first withdrawal was slow  and I must have tried to send gas thinking that was the issue  but I just ended up with transactions keeping my metamask unreachable  blocking me in adding the new custom tokens needed to solve this I ended up rejecting the transactions  and as I don t know yet what was lost  have to go back on my steps to keep count   I somehow got part of it reaching metamask Once I ll have tracked all the transaction of the months  I may have a better view and will come update you guys Edit   What is help desk  I only found the tlegram  discord and reddit as   community support   and explicitly no support from the team Normal people don t use crypto  Ethereum has the most impressive daaps currently  with the most users Exodus returns are not bad  they are about average for Solana   You can do better  and you can do worse Only with Sollet for now but we ll add support for other wallets soon Fees are like 8 cents for a deposit withdraw eventually  yes what was the startup It s currently POW and it s obviously way over max capacity at  100 a transaction sometimes  I m saying when eth goes to POS and transactions are  0 01    well now all of retail wants to swap on eth  and the network gets clogged up again  soon enough the transaction fees are high enough that it prices some people out Normal people don t use Eth either  The network effect myth of Eth is the bubble  Less than 1  of devs in the world write code for Eth too Eth is massively over priced Try Raydium and you will understand  Note how low the fees are No all you need are the keys to the stake authority  Which is the account you sent from to the stake account when it was created  The key to stake account is useless I also hold 70  sol staked on solflare and 30  ray srm lp on solfarm  Sold all my btc  eth  and tezos from the last crash  Would consider buying some btc again if it really crashes  Eth is dead imo and people haven t realized it yet  Btc has the digital gold thing goin for it  For now I am stacking my Solana portfolio though I m glad a decent amount of folk here aren t tribalistic like some other crypto sub Reddit s Im tired of reading non stop Eth cope on this sub  50k TPS low fees deal with it  Eth 2 0 will get Eth to what 100 tps Believe me  I agree  but the    s  investors  apparently don t  Same w BitCoin  The image Name recognition is what people are more interested in it would seem  cause most people don t care to look into it enough to know what s better  But  considering the toll they take in fees and long transaction times  I d hope they get the hint soon Just an Fyi for the crowd that for some reason can t make a Ftx US account  You can go from CB Eth   gt  MetaMask   gt  Wormhole Sollet and trade Eth for Sol on Raydium  99  of your fees will be from Eth but it can be done And Solana costs less than a penny Zero reason to use Eth unless you like high fees and less tps and worse dev language  The Eth coping on this sub is hilarious I was able to make the transaction with the Solana Command Line Tools so all is set  Thank you  Hopefully Solflare adds a cautionary message as it seems many have funds in purgatory from their broken staking console Exactly  ETH isn t going anywhere and SOL knows that so they are going to be compatible and complement one another in a mutually beneficial way So glad I read this comment to learn about FTX  Now I can finally get my hands on some SOL Gas fees are already down over 80  over the past month ish since the gas limit increase  it only costs  0 72 to for a simple ETH transaction today   As far as further reductions  rollups like Loopring are already live  with more going  general availability  later this year  Optimism  Arbitrum  and a couple more I m not thinking about right now  including scriptable Zk rollups  So depending on how low fee you mean  how generally scriptable you mean  and how highly adopted you mean  the answer is some time between  already happened earlier this year  to  slated for later this year  Of course  when Ethereum eventually starts doing 50 100 Million transactions per day instead of its current 1 Million  we may be back at square one with high fees and waiting for further scaling tech   it s the natural result of having a free market for limited block space From my understanding  SolFlare has custody of the stake account json which means I can not authorize transactions from Command Line Tools First  it is very important that you do not accept help from anyone who asks for your private keys or mnemonic phrase or password or anything like that   There are a lot of scammers out there looking for people in need of help and using this excuse to steal their SOL by asking for private details   So never give these private details out  it will never be necessary to give these details in order to reach a solution I don t know the answer to your specific question but I recommend that you go to the Solana Discord s  support solflare  channel and ask there   You will likely have your best chance of getting help  or getting directed to where you can get help  from there https   docs solana com cli delegate stake  https   docs solana com cli delegate stake  amp  x200B Instructions for any body else coming across this Update  I ve installed Solana Command Line Tools and can see that the stake authority is listed as my primary account  going to try and learn how to send funds back via Command Line Tools     Beware of Solflare staking  does not work properly Gorgeous gt Tribalism has reached the crypto world 6 years ago Right price lol  And what s that I have just staked  possibly 72 hours ago   yet the status is still  Activating   using the Solflare wallet   I image it s waiting for the next epoch to start  If so where can I see the Epoch timer Did you mean PoW chains For posting referral links  amp  stuff that aren t relevant to this Solana Subreddit No technical issues  they are waiting for the dip to clear  So they don t get dumps on twice  from bitcoin and from sol whales selling on coinbase    It wouldn t be soo smart to list on coinbase right now  they want to do it when the market is pumping lol I think colloquially ETH 2 0 means a fix to the high gas fees  At the end of the day that is the only thing that  most people are concerned about in regards to Etheriums evolution im of the opinion that as soon as ethereum  catches up  more people move to use it and we re back with the same problems we currently have  no way in hell does ethereum scale from supporting  lt 1  of the world s population to 100  overnight  There will always be growing pains with PoS chains  and there s a driving factor that people will pound a network until its just frustrating for most people to use  and then the overflow is forced to look elsewhere    Cant really speak towards PoH SEC  amp  fam I don t see any issue whatsoever  but if you want to sell your investment because some of the biggest brains in the industry just took a big  longterm position in an asset that has already had parabolic growth and is primed for much more  then by all means do so  There s plenty of people willing to buy what you sell I think those days of  8 might be long gone now tho yeah I had this exact same concern when testing the ledger link for the first time and just found this thread  so it would be a good idea to make this clearer Is there a tl dr for whatever you re referencing in that book Thank you so much OMG this is a rug pull   Run away  sell your bags now before the sky falls   We cannot stand for this raising of capital   Let these hooligans know this Thank you I m a little worried about the securities angle too  Is anything about this sale different from previous VC sales they ve done  from a securities perspective   Sounds like I needed to be more concerned about this a while ago lol So  what is the use to post news here Why don t people just dig the news at discord I am just asking a very basic question But anyways I appreciate your suggestion Also got 100   35  This is just impressive  I would ve sold early lol Soladate how much Need to go to  51 and for uniswap to stay where it s at if we want to be at number 10 ICP is a VC scam   a quick pump and dump scheme  Promises  ambiguity  and just bull shit  SOL is better than that I feel like I m going crazy    this really seems like bullish news to me  but  r cryptocurrency is freaking out about how this is a huge red flag because it dilutes everyone s SOL holdings My view is that Solana already has a sizable tech lead over other blockchain projects  and a  314 million warchest should go a long way towards maintaining extending that in  the future  I wouldn t be thrilled if the tokens were sold at a huge discount with no locking  but I haven t seen any real sources that claim that  Even if the VC s dump immediately  I would just see that as a huge buying opportunity The bearish take on this is basically just more tokenomics FUD  right  There have been so many predictions about unlock dates that never panned out  I would assume that these tokens existed and were allocated for these kinds of sales  but honestly I don t know  I really think the takeaway from this is that smart money is investing in innovation on Solana and funding massive development effort  not  it s a scam  run for the hills before you get rekt   It s possible I m totally drinking the coolaid  though  so please do play the devil s advocate if you think I m totally wrong sent via SPL This also happend to me a while back  I also couldn t find the strings transaction  After reaching the support that couldn t give any comforting sollution on saturday evening  I found out that my funds where returned around tuesday plus minus 72 hours later If no beter sollution comes up  I hope this works for you to just figured out that it was a devnet token  nevermind  someone gave that as a payment   luckily enough I didn t gave him what he bought if I still haven t withdrawn the tokwn can t wait to attend   anyone know at least where the venue will be I found a later one   December 2020 https   solana com transparency report 2020 12 pdf  https   solana com transparency report 2020 12 pdf It is not possible to help you because you have not provided any information about the transaction Is it trustworthy thou Hey can you please make a post about having a daily thread  I posted about that last week and also messaged the mods  I guess we just need to keep making more noise Same Thx I knew about wormhole  Anything specific with real bitcoin No direct bridge at this moment  The EVM compatible wormhole is still under construction  https   www wormholebridge com yeah that is true   so you had Sol  then opened a leveraged position and when that dropped  they took your Sol  and when it recovered they paid you out in USD  That does seem like it could happen  They should probably have to pay you back in the same funds you have used to open the position alright thanks  just gotta be patient then They are developing the wormhole  which is EVM compatible  Meaning you can bridge wBTC and renBTC  among other BTC synthetics  to SOL  eventually  Still under construction  https   www wormholebridge com If I had been liquidated I wouldn t still have all my money  AFAIK All VC investments  especially of this caliber  have lock up periods  Period  End of FUD Join the Discord  https   discord com invite pquxPsq Bullish for the SOL tokenomics  Foundation did not need to liquidate to fiat in order to cover operating expenses  VCs pick up tokens at a discount to spot and likely have vested interest in supporting the network for at least the next 12 24 months I m buying more  Biggest piece of FUD I ve seen all week for probably the best blockchain platform besides ethereum in the past 10 years  The brightest investors going long with hundreds of millions of dollars not to mention the already amazing lineup of VCs that have already backed it since the beginning  Now a16z and people wanna sell  Hilarious  Anyone with a brain will not sell Solana All great questions  In general  common practice is for VCs to pick up tokens from the DAO treasury foundation at a solid discount to market price  These token holdings will likely have lockup periods of 12 24 months to prevent liquidation concerns SAFT investors went liquid on January 7  2021 as did half of the founders  tokens with the remaining half tranche vesting over the next 24 months  See below for the rest of the unlock schedule The latest transparency report from the foundation  Now outdated but useful   https   medium com solana labs solana foundation transparency report 1 b267fe8595c0  https   medium com solana labs solana foundation transparency report 1 b267fe8595c0 I do solflare as well  Worth the hassle to set up imo If you take literally anything said on that subreddit seriously  and I m not just talking about SOL here  you are a moron and deserve to get fleeced Sol is a great stock  But watch out with the price  Unstable market right now you act disgusted but you have very little information  outta here FUDDER Yes mine is getting bigger if youre long on SOL and believe in the ethos  you wouldnt be prodding everyone with FUD  go ask the Solana team on discord if you are so concerned I ve been holding SOL for awhile and don t think this is FUD  These are good questions to get clarity on I think it s FUD because even if they did sell some for a low price  who cares  It s not enough to 51  attack  The project is completely decentralized which is the point Aren t private sales bad because it opens us up to market manipulation  Plus doesn t that spite loyal SOL hodlers  Genuinely curious  SOL interests me but this recent private sale has got me concerned I ll preface this by saying that I invested an amount that i m comfortable losing completely and I plan to DCA into more every month     That being said  why are these questions FUD  Are they not legitimate concerns to be brought up  The team hasn t done anything that would make me not trust them at this point  but that doesn t mean it s wrong to ask questions and ask for more transparency True    I definitely agree with your point about securities violations  It s definitely a new legal area that people are trying to take advantage of before the government can regulate it  But for the short term at least  a large amount of coins were distributed from one organization to 10 and the money will be used for development  so I still see this as good news I guess that s actually one good way of looking at it   But it also makes it look exactly like a security This is good news  The large portion of the SOL token that has been owned by the Solana foundation and the Dev team has been a mark against Solana for the past year  The fact that they are now selling it to finance growth in the Solana ecosystem is only a positive thanks for the answer  sorry but I meant   did you see your balance getting bigger  feel like mine is not gaining any rewards This fud has been out of control  Just trust the team  they wouldn t screw us over Thanks mate Thank you Yes  But I hoped there was maybe a bit more active community somewhere around    A daily thread would help Thy daily returneth would taketh me a lifetime to maketh   I desire happiness follows     I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout Your daily return would take me a lifetime to make   I hope happiness follows and you are a solana whale Lol  no one  It s the list of Cryptocurrency by Total Market Capitalisation on the crypto tracking website CoinMarketCap Exactly This news means cold tokens turned into liquid tokens Now the question  what was the price per token Coinbase Pro Not necessarily  But I have seen wilder swings happen in crypto before  In addition to various flash crashes on any given exchange dex  Always nice to have some stink bids in Who made this list Raydium  Mercurial  FTX   Audius  Star AtlasGo to Solana com  amp  checkout the ecosystem there too Because I would sell Big sol holder but akash is more interesting to me on the infrastructure front Commits don t matter It s just noise Telegram Twitter LOL its a stupid take  Squealing like piggy over his 50 SOL when the technology underlying continually needs work to compete in the crypto space  No one with serious money thinks in terms of small time traders who will pump and dump unscrupulously Navigate solana com I m not sure   I have my SOL on my Ledger linked to Solflare and am staking through Solflare   The epoch that began today is my first Is that you Anatoly  When Airdrop Thx So did this  startup   rasie   314M  or did they sell off some of their large holdings of SOL   Everything about this reeks   It screams securities violations  questions the large sum of capital and points out the lack of distribution  raising serious questions about the decentralized nature of the  protocol    Who s calling the shots here   Yuck and the price     and the lockup  Hopefully there is one Tokens sold from the treasury would add immediate dillution  no Price drop probably Glad to help Yes the link is media network You can buy them all on raydium io You cannot stake on FTX though  correct NGL BULLISH AF Isn t that what this is very important question to ask  yet not a lot of people seem to care in this sub just because the people that bought have a certain reputation it doesn t mean you can just wave the whole argument it is true that they were sold private and we don t know the price  it is reasonable to assume the price was lower than current market  or nobody would buy  the foundation should at least clarify the price at which they sold or this is a clear transparency issue and would at least make me rethink my investment Hold up  CAKE has near 100  APY on SOL AGREED  what platform allows you set limit orders Why is this sub full of moon bois I don t think slots will be available in binance you can check  Try using sollet io or you can go CAKE they given the best APY close to 100  for that you will have to transfer your SOL from binance to a wallet like Metamask Got my sol on binance can I stake it there or do you know where I can stake it  I m gonna hold it so I might aswell stake it Not discounting this at all because I m also a big SOL holder  but Andreessen endorses a TON of crypto s  I almost feel like half the top 100 haha but it s still an overall great thing to see What app are you using here I started investing in crypto this January and SOL was my first purchase git it at  1 9 and has been HODLING it ever since  And recently staked all my SOL for 3 months Here s me sat on 8 thinking I m a player   Just excited to get to double figures In a nod to the engineering roots of Solana s founders  the precise amount raised in the funding round was  314 159 265 359 the mathematical constant pi multiplied by  100 million  Using pi times hundred   that is amazing haha Srm Damn paywall  But it s great news Where can I buy these  Thanks How many tokens were sold in this deal Yes  for sure I need to invest asap  This is gonna be huge One could say that Do you have link to media  sounds interesting   Can second SRM  meme SAMO  STEP Finance Only charles h  is a cultist  read the book  out of the ether   very nice book As always not a financial advice Thanks for this  going to get in early  Cheers and happy for your gains Why not Just bought 33 sol  First time buyer No Thanks You have to click on the staking button  Then below of the page there is the unstake button  There it wil show your balance including your staked assets Yes got it   thanks Voyager token Download their own exchange then  Voyager don t see it on Binance US Good recovery Goes under BQX on binance  Swap end of the month where can one one VGX Do you know what  structured as a purchase of Solana s SOL digital tokens  mean  Does that mean they are issuing new tokens i e  increasing token supply to raise this My 67 SOL starting to not look like a pisstake How long did it take you to see a reward  I ve been staking in Exodus for a month and haven t seen a reward yet Do you see your amount of SOL staked getting large  Mine is stuck at the initial amount and I m wondering if it s normal or juste cause the amount is kind of tiny Holy Shit  The Wall Street Journal  forget about it  Yeah I m hodling SOL closer than I hodl my kids letsgoo VGX is next  Dyor You have to get in early to have those numbers  If average cost was 2 94   but I m 100  there is projects right now that no one knows about that will have these kinds of numbers in future  You just need to do your research and find them  No I don t mean joke coins but something with real fundememtals Any hoop for those of us in the US The sources I trust have a 5 6x this market cycle  and that was back at the ATH BULLISH NEWS    314M is for Defi  so defi in solana will surely boom   The fund was raised from Andreessen Horowitz  one of Silicon Valley s most prominent venture capital firms  Big investor of Twitter  Facebook      and Polychain Capital  a crypto hedge fund that also does VC style investments   The transaction was structured as a purchase of Solana s SOL digital tokens rather than a traditional purchase of equity shares They corrected Andreessen Horowitz is one of the top VCs in Silicon Valley and has a stellar track record  This is a huge endorsement of SOL and brings even more legitimacy to the project Never compare Damn bro And here I am with 100 feeling good  Thanks for sharing lol Article loss credibility with the  1k transaction per second  statement I was joking I love SOLANA  but my wife called  men s defender   from greek  is not too jealous This is the big news here  very exciting for Solana hodlers The transaction was structured as a purchase of Solana s SOL digital tokens rather than a traditional purchase of equity shares So pumped about this project Need to keep building our positions while we can below  50 oh cool let me chk that out That s correct  Big   time Technically it s already in at  9  USDT  amp  USDC should be in a separate stable coin category Other than binance   us  my route lately has been USDC  stellar  algorand    gt  Circle   gt  USDC  Solana    gt  Trade Swap via Raydium If the market s  are right  using XLM  amp  USDC arbitrage between the exchange of choice and SDEX  one can make a small gain on the sale of XLM to USDC  Stellar   Or one can just use a Stellar anchor with USDC minting authority to purchase with fiat This all hinges on having a Circle USDC account  though Haha  Wow  that s interesting  Does the word  Solana   have a meaning in Italian It cannot grow that fast  But yes  that will happen one day edit  actually it could I was thinking in euros but it is still very fast Solana is my wife s name I can t hate her Solana will 100  after 1 month  What do you think guys In the WSJ yeah    I understand where you are coming from I have similar thoughts It can t be accurate with no Ethereum surely Doesn t Cardano and Binance have any either From what I ve heard I really don t like the sound of ICP and the power they would have if they achieve their goals Star Atlas Sol   Google ChromeEth   Internet Explorer It will  This project is solid  I wonder if Solana and ICP can have a project together  ICP should have debut Top 20 and not Top 10  Anyways  pardon  didn t mean to distract But  from       Solana and ICP  will eventually get you that lambo Thank you very much  This helps Reposting myself but my opinion hasn t changed    SRM  it s the decentralized exchange for solana  backed by SBF  lightning fast  and tons of stuff is already being built on top of it RAY  it s an automated market maker with yield farming  swap   etc   development team is top notch and knocking features out of the park at blazing fast speed MEDIA   decentralized content network  Already has a working product  I ve never streamed before and had a stream setup in about 5 minutes   When someone builds a decentralized twitch on top of it  they ponied up 35k for this hackathon for someone to do so   watch out MER   stablecoin vaults  Has a killer development team and notable people funds backing it Also excited about mango markets but they don t have a coin yet  Excited about star atlas but I think we may not get any actual gameplay until 2022 Unfortunately FTX US doesn t allow staking SOL   Otherwise I would definitely stake there   Thanks That is what liquidation is if I understand you correctly  With leveraging  you borrow money from other people to buy more than you can  When you make losses  you need to repay them first  When all of your own capital is gone  your position gets closed to prevent any more losses for those you borrowed from  Basically leveraging is like saying  lend me some money  so I can make more of it and keep the returns  but I also carry the risk for your losses I wish I had a lambo Stop being so desperate man  Just get on with your life FTX Solana may not be the ethereum killer in the literal sense  but it WILL eat up the market that ETH would otherwise have dibs on  THAT is the point to be made Moonlet I think 20 is possible in the next couple of months but do you really think it can go below as 12 or 4 SOL is the true juggernaut this season Flip incoming ok  just wondering what is fickle and scary on solflare right now I m holding on to some btc and eth  not because I believe in eth  in fact I agree with everything you ve said  I m just trying to time my exit  I think the eth price may still have a long way to go  But yes  it s days are numbered  All DeFi will move to solana  no one wants sharding  the security implications are too high  I ve actually bought a little ETC now as a side bet  I think there s a market for a POW smart contract platform and all that mining equipment will be repurposed soon I stake on solflare no problem  And u don t need a ledger   just a USB with ur keystore file  unless u have a 10k plus on ur account They have a lot more running cause it s a real project  Not some shit coin I was surprised it only cost 27 to transfer 80 wow I use exodus on my iphone same problem here with nano s i have the very same issue    tried all ramifications yes  i got frustrated with solflare    no support to contact and problem hasnt changed
2021-06-10,42.02403536,43.00490804,39.59678412,I yield farm on Solana and a few other ecosystems  Harmony  BSC  Terra  and completely agree  I see so many people stressing themselves out trying to trade sideways market oblivious to the fact that they could be earning 60   per year with no stress just yield farming  and appreciation is just gravy My main pet peeve with Solana  however  compared to other ecosystems is lack of reliable bridges  I know there is Wormhole for Ethereum  but heard it s buggy and Ethereum is pretty expensive  I m starting to think there is something fundamentally incompatible between Solana and other chains making these bridges hard to build If Exodus support SPL tokens  you should be able to access them  receive   send those tokens you received by airdrops   if not you ll have to restore your Exodus wallet into another wallet  Sollet  Phantom  Solong      that support the SPL tokens You can also convert USDT ERC20 to SPL using MetaMask and the Sollet io wallet  Just need a little bit if ETH for fees  Then you can convert USDT to SOL on Raydium io With the conclusion on the hackathon I personally think RAY is the best investment right now  We will probably see a few project to launch in the accelerator pools in the coming weeks  Demand is so low at the moment Lol  that guy doesn t know what he s talking about  If you can read a recipe cook book  you can build a node  It s not that hard Solana definitely has the best merch CoinBase pro should have SOL was announced like two three weeks ago OMG WTF yes  Good bot Money is not an issue but I have no programming skills    Not only coders earn good money There has to be a way around this for Americans 5 6k isn t expensive for people that have jobs and background to run a validator  The block fee is a much bigger issue You will definitely lose money if you don t have significant operations experience and if you can t afford  5k of computer hardware you probably don t have what it takes no offense because people with these skills make multiples of six figures If you don t trust the staking of a particular coin then you should not be buying it because staking is how proof of stake blockchains are secured  If that process falls apart in any way  so does that blockchain  I m not saying that you need to stake any of your coins  just that you may want to consider why you d believe in the success and usability of a coin but not trust its foundation  they way it is secured And in case it wasn t clear  my last comment wasn t suggesting not to stake  it was that the staking rewards are meaningless  a distraction  really  if it s depreciating more each year than is the staking reward APR Where would I claim them It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users  I will extend those so they re easier for our sausage fingers to click  Here is link number 1   Previous text      https   www youtube com watch v Sskr  f66ZI      Please

on Luna are that it would have a better   more full life if it was SOL RAY SRM HAPI And so I shall do such a deed  And convert more You filthy ape Just curious  but how is it Solana created smart contract capability so much quicker than Cardano  Does Solana need to be forked to be upgraded OMG thank you for this   I ve been trying to find a way to buy Solana   I knew of FTX but didn t quite understand it   This helps a lot I posted seperately  but do you know all of the platforms exchanges in the US that allow purchase of Solana   Please add to this list  Thanks 1   FTX2  Binance How does it compare with KuCoin and Binance US  It seems to have higher fees I interact with it through kin  The different games and apps that I earn and spend kin all goes on the solana blockchain stop watching these videos and generating views for these experts    nobody knows what will happen  market might crash 50  tomorrow It s really pathetic watching solana try to go up  and trading bots copycat bitcoins moves  Literal copycat on 1 minute candles in a short range  but overall movement is sort of independent  which is why i m trading and longing it Because this can happen  staking is best if you are committed to holding SOL for the mid to long term  because you believe it has good long term prospects  In the long term  the 10  dip will be a blip You should probably know a basic level of coding just for troubleshooting purposes  but you basically just copy and paste the script that the Solana foundation gives you  No need for dev level knowledge Your SOL In Exodus or any other wallet means it s in a SOL address  Airdrops  amp  stuff like that MAY screenshot the address itself if it has SOL or not  So to answer your question  yeah  you can still get Airdrops Apart from the cost of the hardware and the SOL    can anyone become a validator following the instructions on their guide or is it really only for actual developers  I don t have a background in computer programming or coding You re not the only having this issue lately  you ll have to downgrade your browser to the version that used to work for you without such bugs  That s a way to go around it Probably reserve tokens and Solana foundation had to okay this  Remember Solana came out and raised during the most BRUTAL part of the bear market and kept on building  While other projects that had no business raised like 100M  etc  for how much growth they have shown this is good for them and they deserve it for Max growth Yeah whenever somebody tells me about an  academic project  I remember not to invest in it  Makes me think of Cardano  I ve been in academia long enough to understand it s a reputation economy    extremely primitive seems like people are having trouble accessing their ledger within Solflare when using certain web browsers  check out the discord here   https   discordapp com invite pquxPsq  https   discordapp com invite pquxPsq there is a  support solflare channel where people are describing their issues  i haven t experienced any first hand as i have not attempted to create an account stake via solflare yet   still hesitant to start while people are having issues Does anyone know if Solana labs is printing new tokens or if these tokens where held in reserve Also  was this a one sided decision on Solana labs part or is there some sort of on chain governance to weigh in on this decision It s the RSI that helps me most I thought application to be validator is already closed    Or am I wrong  I d love to try being a validator if still possible  Any ideas Yes  a malicious leader could only halt the network for one 400ms block Down Solflare  You run a val  What s your sn  I ve been trying to spread a coins out to a few different machines Ya I mean it s nothing with the Solana foundation  the United States government is just a pain Oh  I m screwed  Didn t know about the legal thing  Dang  I wonder if there are smaller scale nodes that we can build  I wish there were guides  haha Nice collection where ya staking at It is an issue  just not a big one There s got to be a sacrifice somewhere in the triangle dilemmaThere s 1002 nodes right now  all Ferrari s      as we move in time computer hardware should become cheaper  For what we are right now I think it s ok  In the future yes I would love to run a node but I m ok waiting  And compared to DOT and ETH 2 0 I think we are more decentralized  Of course cardano takes the bill here but still  Anyways  I m with you on the argument just my take is that 1 we aren t there yet and 2  moored law scales I agree  The Solana team needs to find a way to optimize the whole node build process  Or completely revamp it  I love Solana  but it feels too much like a business owned by a select few at the moment Whats wrong with discuss the metrics of this amazing project   I support the technology ss much as coin and vice versa including the defi apps There are 2 main expenses  The first one is 5k for the hardware  There is really no way around that  For Solana to support such a high TPS  all validators need to have a strong baseline of equipment  The bigger cost however  is the SOL you need to stake to be profitable  This is around 30k if iirc  However  the Solana foundation has programs where they will loan SOL out to people starting validators until they can attract enough other stalkers  This effectively lowers the total cost to the price of the hardware  The downside is that the program isn t in the US due to legal issues  so if you live here  you re screwed Are you referring to the program that they closed the registration for recently how is the issue of centralization not that big to you  i love solana as much as the next person  but a node being 5 6k is insane the point of this whole space is decentralization  we don t want the same things happening with robinhood gme amc and trade halting  and all that bs  we don t want tradfi centralized bs therefore we should push for decentralization Can you explain how to do this on Binance You can apply for support from the Solana foundation  You d have to KYC of course MACD helps me time entry I started buying in at 47  Bought so much in the dip  and am now deep ITM Agreed While I agree with you we need more nodes  I don t think it s as big as an issue of centralization that most people on YouTube Twitter Reddit make My entirely life has been centralized so coming from that I don t see a big issue But yes agreed more is better SOL sub should be renamed to   Crypto Greenpeas  I vote we merge with some shitcoin sub so u guys can all talk about what special gems y all have On top of hardware  you have to be able to stake like tens of thousands of your own SOL to make it appealing for other people to join Best kept secret Lol  a VERY high end gaming pc  I built a r7 3700x   2060 pc with 32gb ddr4 3600mhz and a wd750 nwme  etc and it only cost  1 4k and it works just fine for most games  Actually better than just fine  But I still think it should be cheaper to set up nodes  They need to optimize this somehow  We need more nodes in the world Some browser ledger updates caused this to happen to a lot of people  I couldn t get it to work on FireFox  Chrome  or Brave on MacOS  I downloaded Chrome Canary and that worked for me Just found and read it   sorry was an early reply  Equipment isn t the biggest issue   at least for me   I don t understand to much from hardware and I am not a programmer  But I think it s an interesting Business Model as I believe in the future of Solana  Alone the use of sending money with such low fees arround the world is a game changer What are those issues about    I was using the latest version of brave  But it s been some weeks ago Ha  I ve been thinking about this when trading  I ve been noticing the trend as well It s actually just a high end gaming PC  For Computer nerds that s actually average Ya  it s on their website  You need like 5 6k in equipment  I can get the link for you after I eat lunch if you can t find it 5 6k is for the bare minimum hardware Do you have information which setup is necessary  Heard you don t Need own Server at Home but could use Amazon web services which would be arround 500 a month You have to do KYC verification  so you have to provide information about where you pay taxes  where your citizenship is  etc I see what you re saying but still think it s not a super useful metric to value solana at this point in time  I think its a great metric for future projections  I just looked at solana beach io and the tps was 1444  it s fluctuating alot  There s thousands of projects coming out of this hackathon and I wouldn t be surprised to see tps triple within just a few months Psssst  I now have the Solmate NFT name        50 000          lol i also read here  on reddit  and discord that people were having issues with certain web browsers being able to access their ledger wallets   but mostly in the last week or so  my ledger nano x just arrived yesterday and i planned to stake via solflare and my nano   but a bit hesitant at the moment  what browser are you using and what version if you don t mind me asking solid list of lead investors   this project is the brightest spot in the future of crypto I m in a LP on SolFarm for RAD SRM and I collect SolPunks  I love the Solana ecosystem and I am very excited for its future Lol it s purely marketing Damn this dude fucks This guy gets it Yes  I can t wait to stake more Maybe prices for greater number of contestants  I can play chess  but also very sure im no way a top 3 If you want to stick to your genius method of P E then it s up to you You just do a google search on valuing a cryptos  most will explain that it is not so straight forward  There are some other methods being discussed  Certainly not like P E For me  I will just use a simple market cap approach For early stage companies it may make sense to value based on sales  in this case that would be tvl  A 3 4 x multiple on sales is accepted I m currently just staking across 3 different validators Saying cryptos don t have cash flow is not quite correct  A platform generates economic value  in the form of transaction fees  That s a quasi cash flow  It s up to the platform to decide what they do with the fees  If they use the fees earned to burn token  for example  that s very similar to a company buy back its own stocks  So even though it s not a direct dividend to investors  buybacks benefit existing investors in a similar way  Bottomline is there are actually a lot of analogs btw valuing stocks and valuing crypto if people are willing to dig a bit deeper  Saying they are not the same thing and calling it a day is a bit of intellectual laziness For Walmart case  it s earnings is related to margins from transaction volume and price of items  Not just base on cheap or expensive price Anyway for a crypto  this website explains why PE is not correct https   blog liquid com beginners guide to valuing cryptocurrency assets Nowadays this is mostly a place to talk about why Ethereum is way better than Sol I only really trust Ray and Srm as long investments right now they seem like they are part of the Sol cabal and aren t going to 0   Am considering Mer Sounds great 160k base plus like  80k in Sol would be getting there  I just have the golden handcuffs right now because my RSUs were calculated at a Fang in March 2020 during the crash  I hate it though and want to work in the crypto space once I vest Exodus wallet  binance us or ftx us I did and it s way better than Ethereum IMHO but I swapped everything to SOL  Just staking  til things get better  RAY and SRM are great but SOL will catch all the attention in the following months I think What are your thoughts on Luna Where do you swap for Sol I stake my SOL  Yield Farm Raydium and trade some alts on Serum  I am also trying to write some libraries that make it easy to integrate Solana wallets with your online store or any website  If you believe in a crypto  you shouldnt just hodl  you should try to help it as much as possible where do i join 160k for a senior rust smart contract engineer  lol thanks for that  I have never heard any risks on staking  but I just don t trust it myself Well  if solana reaches 50k TPS today  and assume average txn cost stays the same  P E would come down to around 10  But that s assuming price stays the same as today  which is unlikely if solana is actually processing 50k txn sec I don t think it s ever too early to apply valuation metrics  For high growth companies you will see high P E and that s normal  But at least the metrics tells you how  high  the price is  and whether it s a solid investment is everyone s own judgement call In my opinion it s way too early to apply this type of valuation metric  Solana is rapidly expanding  What if txn sec reaches 50k within the next 2 years  With how many new projects are being built on solana  it s not impossible Interesting though  thanks for sharing Here s my calculation of P E ratio for solana and ethereum  https   www reddit com r solana comments nwmnsd my _back _of _envelope _pe _calculation _for _solana _and   https   www reddit com r solana comments nwmnsd my_back_of_envelope_pe_calculation_for_solana_and    What do you think If transaction fee is low  the platform needs to attract much higher volumes of transactions to make the same revenue as higher fee platforms  Saying PE is high because fees are low is like saying Walmart is supposed to make less money than Neiman Marcus because Walmart sells things cheaply  At the end of day  a platform enterprise should be evaluated according to total economic values earned compared to price Ahh ok thank you  That last part is over my head haha  Man taxes are going to be fun next year Ahh ok thank you  That last part is over my head haha  Man taxes are going to be fun next year It worked fine for me when i did it a few weeks ago  Only thing is that this documentation doesn t have the root account listed yet  There really is no big difference from a users  perspective  The root address uses the 44  501  derivation path  while the account 0  1  etc use  44  501  0  44  501  1 etc These graphics are all great  I ve been following this project for a bit and they seem to be making great progress   https   twitter com squads _dapp  https   twitter com squads_dapp Ummm  I ll give you 3 1  Mango markets   trade up to 5x leverage and get interest for providing USDC 2  Zeta psyoptions  although not released yet  will be able to trade options on crypto on chain through Solana  zeta will be able to trade options with leverage 3  Mercurial finance   earn interest on stablecoins for liquidity swaps Play the endless other projects I ve been seeing Yeah he did a tournament against magnus Carlsen and they set up a futures contract for it on FTX Does he play Are people still having issues with Solflare or is the process smooth  I m just slightly hesitant given I ve seen problem posts in the past  I d like to stake with some validators that aren t in the top 15 but don t know of another option than Solflare Yes  But if you think of a blockchain such as solana and ethereum as an enterprise  and their main  business  is providing transaction infrastructure  then the transaction fees can be seen as the main line revenue  That allows you to use the traditional P E model as a valuation guidance for the platform  That s only one perspective of course For me rather than Serum and Raydium PythLava CashJet Protocol I thought a PE ratio was more to do with stocks then crypto  Seems very interesting Yes indeed I m in too Nobody tell Sam Dollar cost average in  SOL 2 trillion ya OP unfortunately put a target on his back with this one loli was like you once  then i took advice from a guy like KingPonziyou will learn more in 1 hour than you will in 1 month once you accept the utility of Defi platforms just saw them on  ftx us  https   ftx us you must be missing the tulip usdc pair in raydiums drop down menu Sol yes but doge depends on the validator  that s for you to do your homework  But they won t take a cut like an FX broker Hold it  Do not sell to early  Its a great token Yes mam Best scenario for all coins is btc pumps huge   Later  the alts will pump   This idea of your coin will win because btc is useless and going to go to 0  is not a real winning idea   Leave Brittany alone Yes  That s why it s never wise to chase yields in stocks or rewards in crypto Sol and most other coins  even if they are ETH killers alternatives  tend to follow btc more than ETH   Sol has just done very well and held on to its move up more than most Can t play chess for shit  How about a lottery Get exodus wallet or go to binance us checkers or tic tac toe Sign me up I d be in  Well my kid actually Outstanding can I check a silly questions  if you stake and sol dips 10  in that time   you are still down 10   so apy gain is effectively cancelled out Love the idea  hate the fact I can t play chess One for below 1900 and one for above  so it s fair Rating range  I m barely 1700 Figure it out  Solana ngmi Yeah bro this eco system is sketchy and no one seems to know how to fix it I ve don t this  best yield for very low risk but currently staking on Binance for 22 4Nda85vSL9mS7jPJ3ogmmG1M1p1XfYvMovMQHpRrwt4bYou can send me some to grow my portfolio  It s only with 50 You can see just the SOL BTC like everything else    It s alt season I m having the same exact issue  It used to be ok  i logged in many times before using Brave but now it asks for a 39 seed phrase anyone here helping guys takes 7 days on FTX  only 10  APY as well I love the idea   I m in I ve noticed there is an app  but there are two  FTX US and FTX Pro  is one recommended over the other for a specific reason It s time for Solana to break away from Ethereum and over take it If you buy Solana now  This is the outcome to have in mind  Hopefully this protocol is used for a decade I will be messaging you in 1 year on    2022 06 10 08 10 33 UTC

doing what the master says  Rhis is the ways Holy fuck  ‍  Hero You can swap in exodus but the fees and commission are very hefty  Much cheaper to swap on a Dex or Cex and then move back to Exodus  Otherwise you can say goodbye to 15 20  of your stack which will disappear in fees You should enter now  I amAll in SOL  amp  HAPI  I see both absolutely exploding  Sol priority always  She is a bad bitch   I wouldn t wait too long man not for Coinbase   stsrt dcaing if u can now SRMER SOLSTICE fullForce Same here  I missed the dip on Tuesday  and I hate myself for that  Thing is  I have a very good instinct when it comes to timing  but with SOL it s different  its price movements are truly wild  I also have no clue what I should do this time  I think it s entered a  consolidation phase   but I can t even be sure Exodus is good but  because someone will mention and it is worth mentioning   exodus slightly exaggerates their yield by 2issh  and you can t pick where yoh stake   to  but it s very autonomous and user friendly as Unless they paid you in Solana  p Please be smarter than listening to him or any of the other know it all TA s im waiting for a perfect price to enter SOL  i love the idea and projects  I feel im late to this space  wait till coinbase announce SOL listing  it will pump some more  Sigh  how should i enter Solanax is a brand new project    Btw Solanax airdrop is live  The registration ends on June 20th  and winners will be announced on June 21st    The link below will take you to a form where you must perform a few simple tasks  Once you ve input

To be honest  this project looks really promising you compared wrong graphs  bc  btc is going first everytime  eth continues and after eth  all altcoins  BTC takes dominanace in market now and almoust all altcoines are staying on the same place  but solana is growing and this fact is important  if BTC will slow so SOL will make new ATH Solanax    SOLANAX is a decentralized and non custodial automated liquidity mechanism supporting trades within the Solana ecosystem  SOLANAX does not have an order book because they remove all intermediaries  complexity  and time   consuming procedures from the equation  giving users the freedom to trade without fear of censorship or losing ownership of their assets this is not ethereum  where you earn money  this is charity mining Thanks for taking the time to show us My 2 favourite projects No dilution  no new tokens created for this  Inflation schedule has been built into the protocol Ancho exodus wallet Good write up  My only tip is use ALGO or XLM to transfer  they are much faster and cheaper  So long as the exchange you re transferring to accepts those coins for conversions  LTC is good as a back up to those I did these exact steps just last week  Except for I never did step 6  but that s a good idea  now I m going to look into validators too I noticed that to Uuuuuge This graph is proof that Solana is breaking away from a ethereum  numerically   Just like it already seems to have done from bitcoin Where do u stake Nope  Still don t get it  Am I the only one here that can t work out what this guy is saying Started staking today I think kidneys go for like 30k or something I think you re supposed to give me some  not too sure though I hope OP answers this Using their all time highs I could create a  handicap  by percentage to evenly compare the 2  and Solana is moving more independently precentage wise with everyday moving forward That was the point of this someone commented on earlier post of mine wanting the demonstration of ethereum versus salana so I did Because Andressen Horowitz investing  324M into Sol take on Ethereum is objectively good news if you are long Hmmmm  Translation Yep they aren t very correlated is the point This plot says nothing to me  no offense  Could you elaborate what  the partial but gaining independence   means tracking negative correlation https   www reddit com r solana comments nweryr etherum_vs_solanai_subtracted_the_daily_closes  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share Can you keep SOL on a wallet like metamask I am staking and locked in on all my SOL  I did try to redeem a bit to see how long it takes to get it back early  Was about 24 hours on Binance  So no day trading for me  Lol not if everyone is staking So you want me to say how you did without benchmarking Damn you  Just bought a bag Mate I am the biggest Solana bull around  My biggest bag is SOL  second biggest is COPE  I am ACTIVELY DEVELOPING A GAME ON SOLANA   Yet even I am totally ok with open discussion and dialogue around other ecosystems  especially in relation to Solana and how Solana can be made better   Shutting yourself off to information by labeling people as  shills   before you even know who they are or anything about them  is super dangerous   Also  people might be fans of Ethereum    So what  They are here on this sub seeking to learn more  Why would you try to shut them down or exclude them  That s completely counter to the ethos and community we seek to build here   Just my 2 dogecoin The issue is once BTC starts pumping it will suck the liquidity out of everything I agree Ethereum s biggest problem  and it s adoption curve  and subsequently the adoption curve of crypto writ large  is around tx cost and tps    I think it s second biggest problem is the raw dumpage that will occur when the staking rewards are unlocked True  however polygon is highly centralised FTX US  https   FTX US  is the best option by far  great exchange OP  this is such a solid write up  nice work I am a bit of a newb myself  but also use  FTX US  https   FTX US  to purchase SOL  have absolutely loved my experience with them   I am still going to continue to build up my position  but planned to stake what i currently have via Solflare  i saw there were two options on Solflare for wallet   either creating a keystore file or using a ledger nano x  or s  hardware wallet  I purchased a ledger nano x which just arrived today   so i was going to go that route i am assuming since you didn t mention using a hardware wallet in conjunction with Solflare  that you just went with the keystore file option i am a bit worried about using the ledger nano x now  as I have read some other posts in this sub and in the solana discord about people having some issues with certain web browsers  more recently updated versions of chrome for example  being able to access their ledger wallet  lmk if you came across anything in your experience today  or maybe that you read  that might help me out  was just reading the solana docs on using the CLI to stake using a ledger nano wallet  but then you don t get the nice UI like Solflare provides id suggest looking at sollet as a more  mobile  wallet alternative to solflare and checking out the ever growing defi platforms  the interest rates blow solflare staking out of the water Same with Polygon Ftx us is the answer FTX USNice exchange Yeah  good shout  I just looked at CoinMarketCap  I buy  and quickly remove from  Binance us Looking forward to them going live on Coinbase Kucoin doesn t sell SOL on spot  Only futures  oddly enough FTX USBought it there 28 May I love Solana  but compare it to the Eth chart  not the btc chart  Sol has much more independence than other blockchains  but seems rather stuck to Eth Don t get me wrong  I am very bullish about SOL and I hold a nice bag   but can we stop with the  Etherium killer  headlines Maybe for the better  When I signed up back in December verification took weeks  I had a buddy who waited over 2 months lolz hopefully we d all be rich gt ups like Loopring are already live  with more going  general availability  later this year  Optimism  Arbitrum  and a couple more I m not thinking about right now  including scriptable Zk rollups     gt    gt So depending on how low fee you mean  how generally scriptable you mean  and how highly adopted you mean  the ansboom omg pizza party for the subreddit gt behind them will not be enough  That said  this is fundamentally different than EOS or TRON trying to upseat Ethereu100  agreed lmfao  If you re telling someone to go long  this implies you can hold for at least a year and you will be up  Thus the price after a year should be much much higher than it is today  By saying  bad price  your bascially telling him to trade it which MUCH DIFFERENT than going long gt Do we know if the SOL that the investors received is newly minted or not  Theteam can t mint new sol coins even if they want to  gt Do we know what price per SOL the investors were given for their investment I don t think we ll know that info if it was an OTC deal  it s their right to keep such business deal secret  if the investors bought it with discount and want to sell it at a later stage  it s their right too  We have no right to judge them  their money  investment   their call  gt Has any lockup period been specified This is also irrelevant All in all  this is not something i care much about  as long as the team is keeping the development  what happens next with their sol holdings won t bother me that much  it s their coins  they have the right to do what they think it s best for them  amp  for Solana hahaha these guys are beautiful hahaha I said it once when other people asked about this     Daily Thread     in here If you guys wanna make a     Daily Thread      amp  talk about Solana  sure  no problem at all if that makes you happy  Of course we need to keep it full of good quality posting not just price related talk or else you could go to    SolTrader Telegram Group    https   t me soltraders  for that purpose ill sell my house and buy at  5 Was thinking the same thing  Time for the SOL community to separate from rest of the pack Mine was approved immediately a couple weeks ago  Did something change very recently 1  Buy SOL on Blockfolio2  Transfer to Exodus wallet and stake it for a 10  APY Done FTX US   best option in US for sure  phenomenal exchange Binance US is where I got all mine but I m not sure if Texas has some weird anti Sol regulations that I m unaware of Bought on Blockfolio  Getting 10  APY on Exodus gt eans they actual bought the Solana tokens from Solana Labs  All cryptocurrency developers keep a certain percentage of the tokens for a variety of reasons  One of them is to sale when they want to raise capital for research    gt    gt IICP was super big too lmao Does the Coinbase Pro wallet support staking  IMO one of the big appeals of SOL is that you can stake your coins to earn more SOL  Right now that is paying   8 10  year   but not all wallets support it  If you re truly holding for 5 years then I would strongly suggest looking into that  DYOR

only is it not for sale but they take a portion of the return  No thanks Binance Us but you ll probably have to wait 3 months for verification if you don t have an account already SOL isn t for sale on Coinbase Your 1 month staking reward would be higher than my total portfolio  Congrats the QR codes belong to us  we crowd fund crypto using images like the above  also posted on our website social media   we then buy food and deliver it to the homeless directly  The whole point is a food delivery system for them  They do not have to deal with crypto at all   a common misconception based on the images I think you DID it right back at  2 50 Worthwhile questions  When staking  everyone is drooling over APYs and assuming the underlying coins will appreciate too  If VCs get cheap coins and dump  both of those assumptions could be trash Probably not  but worth knowing the details I ve used Binance US and USDT swap  Liquidity is good enough I was confused at first and thought they got the QR codes only  Didn t see the McD s  How does it work What is IBT Good to know thanks  Did you buy IBT yet I m from TX  The only place we can get it is from ftx us I m not invested in SolFarm nor understand their tokenomics  so I m not the right person to ask   I have invested in other projects with anonymous founders like  Saffron Finance  https   twitter com saffronfinance_  so I could speak to that concern buy straight through blockfolio Omg  bitboy is shilling  Dump incoming  See y all at  5 How stringent is it  Aka what if I had an IP and PO box in Canada Binance Not available in crypto com  it s available on binance I actually put  300 in a few days ago just because I wanted to see what happened and I didn t care if I lose it  But being anonymous and asking people for money just isn t a good look Now I have a question since you seem to know a little bit more  How do you get Tulip Coins  Do you get paid in them as the reward  If so what are the plans for Tullip  How do they create value  I don t usually buy into projects like this
2021-06-11,41.11015538,41.31248445,35.31117152,Not financial advice  but why not enter now with a small buy to get the ball rolling with compound interest  staking rewards   You can start earning some Sol while you wait for a dip to make a bigger buy Damn what s his ELO You have clearly never worked with scale Not that hard to get one up its hard to 99 99  uptime on your comcast  Slashing will be fun for you Might get more traction and people to join if you xpost in r chess once there s a decent amount of members  My question just becomes who is the independent party that will payout top places  Obviously there doesn t need to be a  huge  amount of trust when entry fee is  01 but still  would be good to know the organizer isn t just cutting and running with the prizes lol As someone who is like 1890   lt 1900 is a pretty massive range  I can fairly consistently wipe the floor with 1500 1700  Having a  lt 1500 could be good to get kids and newer chess players in too since Lichess starts ratings with a provisional 1500  rating  Just a thought SOLANA  350TREE FITTY I use raydium  trade on serum because fees are literally cheaper than centralized exchanges  and I use solfarm  I use phantom wallet alot and when solrise comes out  count me in  I also have some mercurial because I like the ability to yield farm stable coins Name the third one mole Yeah if you go under finance  earn  then locked staking Then search for solana  for me 90 days was sold out so only 15 and 30 days and they have limits too but pretty high return By novel Proof of History https   link medium com 8GAyutIkZgbNo need to fork to push upgrades Interesting idea   though I m not sure I m convinced that P E ratio is useful for cryptocurrencies  I look at cryptocurrencies as being somewhere in between tech stocks  currencies  and commodities  I m not a forex trader  but I don t think  earnings  makes a ton of sense for valuating currencies  government tax revenue does have implications for value of fiat currencies  but that s hardly a straightforward relationship  Ownership has a different meaning with crypto  compared to stocks   and I think this is where P E falls apart as a metric for cryptos  With stock  you own a portion of the company and have a claim to that portion of the company s assets and earnings  When you purchase cryptocurrency  you own a digital currency that can be used to do stuff on the network  but you don t own a portion of the network itself or the underlying infrastructure  Granted  EIP 1559 and PoS kind of muddies this  but I think the current situation with Ethereum is pretty cut and dry  Holding Eth doesn t entitle you to the network s transaction fees  as that belongs to the miners that invest hash power in the network Your calculations suggest that Solana might be overvalued compared to Ethereum because of transaction fees  but I would argue the opposite  I think Ethereum is overvalued because the high transaction fees negatively impact ETH s utility and efficiency  If I buy  200 of Sol and  200 of Ether  I can do a lot more with that amount of Sol  in terms of   of transactions   To me  this utility gap seems more relevant to value of the tokens than  earnings  of the networks that I have no claim to as a token holder I d be interested in seeing what the ratios would be with DEX trading fees counted as earnings  I still think the relationship between earnings and value is a lot more indirect for cryptos than stocks  but I think that would at least give a fairer representation of the networks  earning power This comment did not age well  Sol is literally dumping lmao i would wait a few weeks  actually after coinbase launch  since most coins pump at the notice of the listing but dump after the actual trade goes live So 1 sol token gives you a ton more utility than 1 eth  to me that makes it more valuable Also  solana is designed so massive amounts of transactions is actually feasible  If fees were expensive this would not be possible Nice  I ll check it out after I eat lunch Hmm may need to change my wording was referring to dogecoin Very cool  I ll check it out now  Like I said  thanks again for your perspective I ve done work from the Coil side of things I doubt Solana will get branded as a shitcoin   Its a very legit project Nice video   good explanation What project do you work on in particular  I appreciate you admitting your bias given your experience  It s really helpful to hear a fresh and candid perspective There s room for every currency   We just need Solana to be a member of the  big three  rather than some shitcoin like doge Too early to say IMHO  Nothing bad that I noticed but I m aware that SOL is still in its infancy and for now it s  just  a cheaper and faster version of Ethereum with fewer DeFi options  of course  Will it change improve  Yes Mango is already live too Bonfida   Oxygen  Raydium Yes I do think the Interledger Network makes sense  since it s meant to be currency agnostic  XRP made sense for streaming payments because of its low price point  low fees and the fluctuating price isn t as dramatic as the other coins  Also  the creators of the Interledger project worked at Ripple when it was created  which makes sense on why XRP was the first currency supported  Coil is now spearheading the Interledger project and foundation with partners like Uphold  that support Solana  running their network infrastructure I know this sub doesn t prefer buying Solana on Uphold because of you currently cannot withdraw the tokens right now  but from a business use case this shouldn t be a barrier  In the future  if Solana is on the Interledger it should be much easier to transport it outbound FWIW  I just personally think it makes sense because this micropayment streaming network exists and companies like Imgur  wowhead and HackerNoon have already implemented it and tested at scale via Coil s web monetization  I am a bit biased because I do work on the tech myself and I am a big fan of Solana Volume of transaction especially at the institutional will require a lot of SOL   And low fee for non institutional means easy and wide adoption And there s an important de fi problem that I can t disclose at the moment that gives the low fee high transaction rate Solana a competitive advantage and will make it the smart contract leader Ignoring USD  calculated purely in SOL  the Solana s total supply is  625 its yearly MAX amount spent on feesIn other terms   there are total of 500M SOL  gonna increase and  800k SOL year is spent on transactions at network s maximum capacity 50k tps to get solana node 10k solstarter and dexlab could end up crazy Thanks for your write up Serum and Raydium That s what I understand as well  but I guess it s easier on SoundCloud to take down unauthorized content  while on audius I assume it would not be be So it would probably be boycotted by the musical industry I guess the users will go where the artists go and Audius presents itself as the most profitable platform because it can pay with its token  but I m wondering if the tokenomics even be sustainable for such an endeavor Sol can scale it s tps from its current 50k max to 500k  they said theoretical max is around 750k  as our cpus and internet speeds upgrade as well  The tps for cosmos and dot are great and enough for now but could they handle a portion or the global economy when more of the world financial system and data is moved on chain  Sol can continue to get faster as the number of projects and users increase  by leveraging faster hardware that s going to keep coming out  Chains have to be future proof  ETH was great up until this last run up  It wasn t future proof  which is a very important Anyone not telling you Zeta and a Mango Markets are lying As far as I can tell  it seems to be the very similar to SoundCloud  which is somewhat niche  That said a lot of artists have used it as a platform to gain popularity The high staking in sol and the processing power required to keep up with the system speed seem to be the bigger bumps on the road to get new validators fast  It s a very new system so the amount of validator is really small  around 700 compared to about 34k on Etherium   but we are comparing a year old platform with a 6 year old platform which is not fair at all  This makes the decentralized promise to be slightly compromised in comparison  but again this is a new platform that is already delivering more than much older platforms that haven t been able to deliver anything but promises  The Solana foundation is doing a great job at helping people become validators by creating programs to fund the staking and find server service space that is in shortage at the moment  I think in a short time we will see exponential growth of validators and I can tell Solana is working hard to help to allocate resources and splitting the stake into as many users as possible to tackle the centralization issues currently present Well  now is a great time  Imo  anything under  50 is a great buy for Solona SolanaSummer has started check out Serum  follow Anchor  Solanium  Solstarter Would a Social Media Network using Blockchain not be vulnerable to being shutdown in the way Parler was  I feel like any system that solves the Server Farm Censorship problem would be very lucrative Store of value vs smart contract platforms  Nano is unbeatable for direct payments and store of value Definitely good to hear  was worried about that one true  i try keep my defi staking within a shorter term to reduce risk What do you need nano for if tx fees for solana are 0 00001    What would be the benefit for solana to team up or collaborate Absolutely  Impossible to know what ll happen  Guess that s what makes all of this stuff so exciting to follow Nano and Solana are my favorite projects because I haven t found anything bad about them yet  Would be cool to have them team up somehow Ok  That s what I m doing  Maybe the problem is with raydium and not my wallet  Thanks for the help  I ll have more time this weekend to look into it no man  i  m saying you choose the     Derivative Path        Derivable Accounts    that contains your address  amp  click   Restore    you don t choose any of those addresses  useless   i made screenshots so you get my point Imgur  https   imgur com cKrf83o  Imgur  https   imgur com yFV9hlG I m sorry I m not getting this  Are you saying I should be able to chose one of those addresses  Cause I can t chose  It only restores the first one  How do you choose a derivative path Awesome  another pro for sol Solana is still in beta  I also think most things about it are a lot better than in other projects  I don t consider anyone a competitor really  Of course the market has a different opinion but I would not want to use anything but Solana for a project right now  My main concern is the governance mechanism  which is currently still very centralized  Even slashing is still manual and in the hands of the developers  I hope they will work on a decentralized governance protocol in the future  so that governance decisions can be decided by stake  But I think currently they are still focussing on decentralizing stake  for example with stake pools Good to hear  was curious to hear from a developer themselves You heard wrong about rust   Rust is the most beloved language in a 2020 survey  https   stackoverflow blog 2020 06 05 why the developers who use rust love it so much    You probably refer to it not being as easy to learn as some other languages and it being a relatively new language makes it so that not a lot of people are capable of it yet  But for me as a developer this is a huge milestone for programming languages  It is both fast and secure Plus you will get only a line as a result which is easier to interpret this isn t a good way to observe correlation IMO since you normalize it with ath it might be misleading if the coin is about to get ATH s or it had more ATH s  Check this out https   en m wikipedia org wiki Cross correlationthe main logic is to multiply each value at each time  As you know with multiplication the result is bigger if both is big  not only one of it both that is the optimal way to make the product highest  then the result is big indicating they are highly correlated  Maybe you can then normalize them with their ath s but as I said there might be inaccuracies I m a software dev  haven t worked with Rust but I hear more positives than negatives No man  that s what i m trying to tell you    you only need to choose the Derivative Path that contains your address  amp  click   Restore      this should get your wallet restored  that s what i do always   If what i just said already didn t help  then better ask in  Sollet section in Serum Discord Appreciate you trying  When the list of deliverable wallets comes up does that mean they are all connected when I click restore That part confuses me Out of solutions tbh  better head to  Serum Discord  https   discord gg EDvudv6      Sollet   channel  amp  post your problem there  Sollet wallet is their product  so they ll guide you through the solution better than anyone else Algo trading extracting money from retail traders  Solana is built for high frequency trading and to induce retail traders to trade on emotions and take their money I clicked restore but the address that comes up is different and has a 0 balance  I have step LP tokens on raydium and can t access them juvu very vj jihircznmii   qtx    usugar h  hy id uc up bc Yeah I googled immediately after I asked and sorted it ha    got the 15 day package for 22 Hi I just got my self a ledger supported Solflare Solana Wallet  Are there Dexes where i can yield farm on Solana  Thank you any discord link for early project solana I am currently considering adding Solana to my portfolio  I have watched several videos about the blockchain and Polkadot Can someone red pill me in 3 4 sentences  why anyone would build on Solana instead of Polkadot or Cosmos How many coins were sold How many tokens did they sell  At what price Great mentioning rust  I wouldn t have said that  but when I read through smart contracts  it was my first rust experience and in deed it won t be my favorite language    not yet   But you could implement other languages I guess  it just needs to be compiled  I think the high percentage share of coins is a problem for many projects  The alternative is that they are held by early investors I guess the free market will decide who survives and who doesn t Tbh the only reason I wouldn t bet my life on sol is it s decentralisation  Only has about 700 validators  and I think I ve seen something about the ratio of coins in circulation held by developers is really high but is slowly decreasing  Also heard that rust is not a developers favourite language but I m not a developer so I don t know  Apart from that it just about is perfect This one is having your address  correct  you should be able to click on   restore   button next  Can you show me the   Restore   button how it looks like  grayed  or isn t there at all PS  you don t need to   click   on your address there  all you need to do is choosing the right Derivative Path that has your address  amp  click   Restore    that s all Great statement and question Fees are dirt cheap  I mean you can spend years of transactions with one SOL  I mean  what utility is there to have more than    Three Speculation  yes  ok I understand  but the fees paid in order to work with projects on chain is like a cent  You should do like high frequency trading on Dex in order to need more than one  So Ethereum has pumped alot cause all these scam meme coins need hundreds of dollars in gas  BnB is pumped propably by binance  but what good is it to have like 3 4 sol other than selling high Tried on pc too  It only allows me to choose that first address which is empty   https   i imgur com m8uyrrU jpg Most coins in the market have taken about a 50  haircut over the past few weeks  This isn t going to help your cause  Also  please look at the tokenomics of STEP  they have a pretty aggressive release schedule of tokens which will cause a dilution effect on the price  This release schedule is also a big reason why you can get such a high APY  There are impermanent loss calculators you can find with a quick Google search  are you sure that over the next years at that apr  you won t come out ahead  You need to look at this from a longer term view  I would suggest reading up on impermanent loss   https   academy binance com en articles impermanent loss explained Is audius going to completely migrate to solana and use an spl token  Would love to see a full commitment from them has it changed from activating yet Oh sorry  I removed it from my tradingview watchlist  Well anyways  that shows that even after an 80  drop  we can drop even further  I hope atleast raydium stays stable at 4 5 5  I got in at 14  damn Here  https   twitter com Solana_Mates status 1402968783656865796 s 19 Mhm not directly on Solana as far as im aware  There is  Fiyer

send them here but I will repost this on Twitter if that s cool  Good man   Interview me        a young bull   in the face of FUD and Normies   I HODL with no surrender Blessings Perplexing to say the least   I have been wondering this  for us to fully adopt USdc   they have to be backed by actual dollars  I know printer go brrr and it doesnt mean much actuslly but follow me here  compared to XRP which is not backed by or pegged at a price   help my monkey brain solve this riddle   is the end goal to have some sort of  1   1   item  And does the dollar sign even mean anything in 2045  The future is so weird  But one thing I do know S O L A N A Hahaha I Lowkey have a problem  Solana hands em Out on a platter  Just about every project  Especially when I realized summer could be SRM I knew I had a addiction I used the app for a while and I find it    very underwhelming  Maybe I m missing the point  but if anyone can upload music  isn t it just becoming a huge mess  Also  how do artists defend their ownership on music   I didn t delve too deep into it so if you can clarify these aspects it would be very interesting  Thanks do you have links You know not all ideas have to stem from puns  right exactly and that s what i did  im a proud owner of 1 SOL  looking to buy more How exactly does that work  You stream an artist s song and you pay 1 cent for it directly to him or how Super interesting point I think Solana is also partnered with Circle to support USDC stablecoin too  So if the government adopts USDC  which I believe is highly probable   do you still think the Interledger use case makes sense for Solana  How about the case for XRP  I ask because CBDCs seem kind of inevitable at this point as a step toward crypto adoption at scale  and I ve had less exposure to both solana and xrp There is Nina https   twitter com nina _market _ You can calculate profit or loss here https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1HPU_uG3iJ_ns27CItdWGllW0c Pn07J0_LEDZs1otQY edit gid 0Just put in your expected stake amount  commission  and costs   You can find out how much SOL you need staked to break even Generally you run at a loss for a while as you try to attract stake   If you can attract enough  you become profitable I tried on chrome canary and it worked   Thanks this is what I did  basically the same thingWallet to Wallet transfer error SOL to USDC Token  I purchased some SOL have it on my Ledger address accessible through Solflare  Also have 2 tokens on same address COPE and USDC  both visible  I sent some SOL to the USDC token using Soflare interface even paid the SOL fee and authorized it on my ledger  USDC has O balance but this says    https   solscan io account CWTwuXxHLK2GNcvw9MuXWoeNkeZypbfXBVBJUeCZtHDg    Ultimately looking to swap some COPE for USDC  My SOL is in limbo Look up Finematics videos on yield farming and that kind of stuff  I got into step usdc pool when step was 6dollars  It quickly yielded me 10  of what I put  But then it started dropping and dropping  Felt like a slow rug tbh  But I think around 1dollar token is the bottom I think it would be cool to see Solana be apart of the interledger network and web monetization  as a whole  Interledger is meant to be currency agnostic and designed to stream payments  and more   so it doesn t make sense to redesign the wheel  The only thing I ve seen tested on the interledger network is XRP  but Uphold does allow you transmit BTC or ETH through it Would be interesting for Solana to have a valid use case here Use a desktop  Some functions are not showing up on mobile version I have no idea how it shows up on the phone though  my suggestion is about restoring your wallet through the browser  PC That s what I would have assumed but there s nowhere to click on any of the accounts  I ve clicked and clicked but it doesn t do anything  Is it not possible on iOS possibly You just click   Restore   on the Derivative Path that has your address  meaning  the one you said you saw your address in is your Wallet you should restore  gt The account that has my coins is the second one down Everything that is about micro transactions requires super low tx fees  Sol is it ledger solana settings allow blind sign  yes Thanks for the idea  I will post there too   I will he in charge or it  and since Solana has a blockchain explorer  it will be completely transparent Holy shit this is a really good point  Hope this discussion is spread more   ima look into audius rn   a SOLify instead of spotify SeriumXM instead of serius   etc SRMMER SOLSTICE is upon us Thanks for correcting  Iam not an it specialist or programmer  just someone who reads and invests in good stuff like SOL  So if I conclude you need over 100k worth of SOL  current price  but better 400k   for 10000SOL  and say 10k equipment for a node  So the big question for me is what Return can you expect  I think the issue with that much sol could be solved with running the node shared like a real estate investment partnership Also much more risk No update In 19 days  Especially with binance issues wtf is going on with SOL Coinbase What utility is there to have more than 3 US dollars  I really don t see what good it is to have more than  3 since I don t have to pay exorbitant bribes every time I use my money Beyond having money that you can use without getting robbed  the utility of having a lot of Sol that you can use it to help secure the network  running a validator node or staking and earn rewards for it Ok  I m staking ATOM too  but I can usually see a reward balance that I have to claim  Not so with Solana I will be messaging you in 6 months on    2021 12 11 23 10 59 UTC    http   www wolframalpha com input  i 2021 12 11 2023 10 59 20UTC 20To 20Local 20Time  to remind

of these  i would love to see one of your websites Huge progress  this ecosystem is blowing up  The value is proposition to new projects choosing which blockchain for launch on is so obvious  High speed  low cost  scaleable  extremely skilled team definitely good to ponder  I personally think that whether there are certain things they are intentionally keeping extra lowkey  or if they are just a little bit further down the pipeline  all of this stuff serves as even more of a way to fool proof the blockchain both in terms of workload and diversity  and when more heads are in here  organically that is when the truly game changer stuff drops  just my speculation  amp  x200B  lt 3 The branding makes me think of retiring to Solana Beach Look up REEF  this coin shows worst case

see how much this man regrets not investing in HAPI lololol It s  you re  fucktard Just buy the native asset  SOL Hey you dipshit Aussie  You gonna fuckin fix your grammar or what  Ginger headed bitch Wait  what does the APR actually mean then  What currency does it equate to Sorry to hear that  390  isnt in dollars though Ah  ok  Were they issued new tokens or were they tokens that already existed Solana is the  shares    These investors got paid with Sol tokens Is there a way to buy shares of the company behind Solana I m not selling till  2500 This is unsophisticated   insane It is already There are no legal ways around it You don t need much of your own SOL to make it appealing for other people to join   You do need a compelling reason for others to stake to you  best in class returns  special unique features  great marketing  etc Running a validator on AWS would be around  5 000 per month  not  500   That is an actual figure  calculated from real research  not made up   Quite simply  the amount of egress  outbound network bandwidth  required is way beyond what AWS can provide inexpensively   You will pay at least  4 000 per month just for the network costs with Amazon A raspberry pi will never be able to run a Solana node   Solana is a high performance blockchain and needs high performance hardware  high performance connectivity  and high expertise from its operators I also wish I could build a fortune 500 software development firm using high school dropouts   But it can t be done The incentive to build nodes is that you can make money doing it if you are smart enough  dedicated enough  and willing to take the risk   If you re not any one of those three  don t bother   If you are  it can be profitable already  without any subsidy from anyone You do have to have a business plan and an ability to attract stake   The easiest way would be to create some app or service that funnels people to your validator   Right now Exodus is mopping up the stakers despite mediocre returns   It can t be too hard to compete with that if you are motivated and can make a competing app What s that you say   That would be too much work   Well  Solana incentivizes value add   It doesn t incentivize just throwing together some hardware that anyone could do  slapping some software on  and making money   You have to bring more to the table than that   What you bring is what will make you money and will make Solana better   If you have nothing to offer to make Solana better  you probably will not make money   It s pretty simple  really According to some peeps in the discord  ledger devs are working on resolving the issue I fixed my problem  turned out to be a misspelling of one of the 24 secret words  it works now It s not about screwing investors over but I checked out a coin called REEF   They made some deal to give so many coins to this investment company for so much money   Anywho  soon as the company got first big batch of coins  they dumped them on the market   I still haven t invested in it cause no updates on what s happening with that deal   This was back in March The interest won t be shown in your portfolio  Click on solana from your portfolio and you ll see it s actual balance I did not see Solana in the Aave github  Am I mistaken  Thanks I would message https   twitter com Alevtina_Y s 09 Uphold  but you can t move your SOL off the exchange and there is no staking there I think the genius behind Solana is the devs have taken the concept of a normal database  created some sync nodes and called it a blockchain Stunning Why do we need proof of work when proof of history or time is just as good but easier to manage Hats off to the Solana database engineers So sollet is an app for phone Second  successful  transaction here https   solscan io tx 5yjWES45srVKdaq3Lt2kpYEfnHBhgjL1Aa6XiEEKrkd6sjb3Q4zR147tSckBYpoup198W3kzbYfZBwWPxMpjnt2Z it has a cold hardware connect function   thats what I use that happened to me using windows edge   I now use Brave works fine Looking into it  In the meantime  I transferred the old fashioned way  Converting SOL to USDC via exchange and then on to final destination  Hope I haven t lost  1300 dollars  however  Metamask doesn t show the smaller second transaction I did either so maybe it just takes a long time  We can only hope it s stuck in transit somewhere   Thanks Isn t 500k tps too slow for true global adoption Metamask only I believe  Should take longer than the average SOL transfer as ERC20 tranfers have to be validated on a network that does like a fraction of Solana s TPS  But before you do anything further I would look into the Sollet bridge docs Any idea who supports the bridge  if anyone Bridges suck  Blockchains are amazing  Follow the SOL   gt  Binance route next time and its gonna be like a clockwork I just tried another transaction straight to my Metamask address  No dice there either  Hopefully just delayed  Blockchain sucks Keep us posted I m going to be completely honest with you here  When a transaction like the one you linked says  Success   it means it has been confirmed  This does not mean funds are safu  Far from it  Because while the funds might be there  you sent an SPL token to an address that does not recognize it as a token  Because they are only built to read ERC20 tokens This is unfortunately a weak point in the Sollet Bridge  As I understand it  you shouldn t have changed the recipient address of it  Keep in mind  I have never tried that bridge myself  so it might actually function differently from what I have read I saw a similar post where a user sent to his coinbase deposit address  and Coinbase manually credited the transaction several hours later  but there s little hope for that in this case There might be a tool you can use or some resource to help retrieve it  but I can t help you there  In my personal opinion the best way to realize investments from the Solana network is to buy it into SOL and transfer to a supporting exchange and sell it to a stable or something When the price goes down that s bad  Other than that it s all good hahah Non custodial address  Can t find anything on Etherscan about it 0xBd8dE189bb83202E6455121D66D764e28104ACA6It said I had to approve via Metamask but I never got an approval dialogue The way I see things  and I have hardly any experience in this particular issue  you might be at the mercy of the almighty blockchain gods  Did you send it to an exchange address  And if so  which one Well  I connected Meta mask but did replace the ETH destination with another ETH wallet address  How badly am I screwed Well  I connected Meta mask but did replace the ETH destination with another ETH wallet address  How badly am I screwed Please tell me you used the Sollet bridge and didn t just randomly send to an ERC20 address Why no multiroute I mean  it dropped 20  in less than two days  This is not a dip  it s a literal dump  and that s a fact  Yes  it s recoverable  but just wait a little  That goes with patience  I d rather wait for it to finish the move down to  35 and see if it holds  then dca or whatever  Right now is definitely not the time to start building a bag  If you re already in it then great  keep dcaing just for discipline What about BSC   Is it better transaction cost then BSC Oh  ok  I was just wondering because I always seem to miss out on new projects lol We arent at that point yet  We arent gonna make a discord until we have a working product at least in alpha  But stay tuned man  Ive got 5 really smart people chugging it out Oh cool  Do you have a discord or something I can join  I m really interested in a project like this Good bot ow for this video  it is about the Step Fiance  They are the project on Solana with the crazy APY for adding LP  That number is going down and I explain why on the video  They are also the first yield watch type site on Solana that I have found  They aim to do a lot more than help you track your investments  Check out the video and let me know what you think        Step Finance  https   test step finance   dashboard  Step Finance GitBook  https   docs step finance I uploaded some music on

depends  but not enormous apparently  You better check it yourself How much does it return Oh  then ok  that s pretty safe thou I don t know how to farm on raydium at all Solana is one of my biggest investments but anyone who wants a truly decentralized blockchain it doesn t seem Solana will ever be that with money needed to build a node  Others agree or am I mistaken Isn t that a small apy for locked staking  I mean does is worth doing when you can farm on raydium The tech isn t everything  I m not saying it should or shouldn t be  just the fact that it isn t  Network effects are one of the most important  if not the most  If people don t use the platform  it s irrelevant  and that s why 1 ETH  is  more valuable than 1 SOL  at least nominally and at least right now  I m not putting SOL down  I own some  just not as much  in portfolio    as others on here I suspect there are two projects coming soon on Solana  social nft platform   only1 and online dating platform   soldate This is in the works Good video  keep going  I wonder what solana will cost by the end of the year  but I m pretty positive about that Its a 100000 times cheaper and 1000 times faster version of ethereum without the quantification is just seems useless Me too I m a big fan of Solana  and something that perhaps doesn t get discussed much regarding Tokens is their branding   and I think Solana is really great in this regard  The logo is bright  the name is memorable and doesn t sound too techy  and their design language in their website and promotional materials is modern and attractive  I hope these elements all encourage non blockchain people to get interested and engaged in discovering more  Perhaps also makes it easier for brands like Culture Kings and  fingers crossed a particular car manufacturer in the future  to see Solana as having good brand alignment with their target consumer demographics   This is in stark contrast to Cardano  but it s also clear that Cardano is going after a very different userbase  Solana s development has been rapid and certainly appears as a  fun  techy upstart  in the space  BUT  that approach may see larger classic tech organisations  institutions and  serious software  development stay away from Solana  It s possible that these orgs might want to move towards something that is a little more straight and narrow  and a little less exploratory and  exciting    So the two downsides here are potentially it s loose but fast development approach  and it s branding for some forms of adoption Regarding validators and decentralisation of the ecosystem  I found this video really informative  https   www youtube com watch v jcVek9OnVjw  https   www youtube com watch v jcVek9OnVjw   Regarding coin distribution   tokenomics  The Coin Bureau highlighted some of the concerns he percieved here   https   www youtube com watch v PA1kA5yT1Ac  https   www youtube com watch v PA1kA5yT1Ac   TLDW  Seems to be quite decentralised  even with PoS   especially considering how early the project is in it s development cycle  But there s also a lot we don t quite know about how the token itself and how it is held Sam bankman fried retweeted this way to become a solana validator for  70 a month  https   twitter com skynetcap status 1401757615441387520 s 19 I agree with you that the overall SOL price is on the conservative side and that there s much more room for upside   My rational behind the BTC price is based on the historical stock to flow model   SOL being at  12 by marketcap is a bit high in my mind and I wouldn t be surprised it it repositioned in the late teens  early 20s Overall my thought for the SOL price prediction is that its better to be too conservative than liberal Yes  but you probably haven t gotten any  Your SOL address is capable of accepting multiple types of SPL tokens  But all of the airdrops I have seen you either have to do something in particular or already be holding a certain SPL toke  IE COPE  in order to get it  So  if you have not done anything in order to participate in an airdrop  it is unlikely that one found you  I ve got some worthless shitcoins I could drop to you I think your price predictions are a bit too conservative for sol  and a bit too high for BTC  A 5x for btc is an easy 10x for most alts maybe they notice  thanks Abou the decentralized part I ve read about it actually being decentralized  but  unfortunately I don t have the knowledge to explain why  I was just doing my own research on that topic  I may suggest u look further on this  even on this sub  there s a lot of discussion about why it _is_ decentralized and why some people think it s not   Again  just saying and trying to be impartial  as I ve read both parts of the matter Raydium  https   raydium io

5  and watching it go to 40 If it dips to 20  again I will buy a lot of it for sure lol solanapalooza An APR of 390  would mean that if you put in 100 step tokens you would get paid 390 step tokens  over the course of the a year  That would only be if the rewards remained at 390  for the full year which it will not and it is planned to reduce over time  It is just 390  right now  Either way it your APR is in step tokens as you can  and did  lose money in USD while getting paid 390  in the form of additional tokens I just don t wanna see SolanaFall And since they haven t told us let s speculate  My guess is that they sold 100 000 000 tokens for  3 14  PI 3 14149265359 I might be being a tech dummy and I m not 100  sure  But I ve tried twice to make posts asking this in the topic and I can t find it  Surly they aren t censoring the reddit Bingo  The press release disclosed the total amount of the investment  but not the number of SOL tokens that the investment purchased  I ve spent some time researching but I haven t found a disclosure of that rather critical number  Is the information public  If not  Mr SOL token   given that you are no way  no how  never ever like a security that should be regulated by the SEC   why not SAMO     thought STEP was promising but it s down a lot now  SRM like others said   but mainly hold SOL I don t think the hardware cost is a problem at all  The real problem is the block fee   5k isn t much investment for something that can make you money What the hell    Is this really the spending of raised 1billion     I guess you need some good management  These projects are made from 16 year old kids with pathetic websites     Solana is overwhelmed with shit projects and coins  why the hell you need 100 defi and dex while you need only 1 good which combines everything You can use any lang that can target llvm no just Rust such as Cpp or C  Rust extremely in vogue right now too Are any of these projects from the recent hackathon  Anyone have info on when those winners are announced and where  Cheers

I can stake Solana  Any feedback If there is a marketplace on the SOL blockchain that you are familiar with  please let me know I disagree  Personally  I feel SOL Punks are an opportunity for Solana investors to get their shot at Crypto Punks on the SOL blockchain  I will be keeping certain ones that appeal to me and I haven t listed here  for this reason Let me sell some and the price will go up again  happens everytime within minutes lol SOL  LINK  HBAR  DOT  THETA  ATOM and LUNA are my long term holds       Maybe FET  ZIL and ONE also lol Ugh ripoff punks are just  not good Must not be set

still down until we get higher highs Pretty sure I saw about 10 different binary options protocols  With these plus PsyOptions someone will need to make an options market aggregator There is no marketplace that I am aware of  however  the SOL Punks dev team facilitates exchanges  from my understanding  There are also other third party mediators we could refer to  if you are interested Maybe a project to project a project to choose em  even Where check it out as well   it looks promising Wanted to bump this as I m also looking for the pitch deck Exactly running a node is a very lucrative thing indeed how do u vote No  solana staking is set up differently for some reason  I realized that when I went to stake ADA So what exactly do you want to prove  I m in sol as well  If your goal is to hold more sol long term  do what I said  You talk about patience but can t wait a couple weeks  got ya this gives me concern too   Is there an issue with the token ownership And KuCoin only lets you do futures for some reason  no spot You should  We could all buy twice more SOL for the same amount of fiat By buying you make the price rise Notable Punks are   Rank 120  Rank 469  Rank 922  Rank 1431  Rank 1931 Me too  I have my eyes on solana  nano and terra SOL  DOT and LINK for me Probably because I had just bought some How do you expect people to evaluate that many projects and come to an actual conclusion We need another project that evaluates the projects Thanks for clarifying  I m new to this stuff so don t know much about it besides that Sam retweeted it  I remember him saying in a podcast as well that there will be custom solutions to run solana nodes for  500 coming soon Don t think he s the kinda guy to exaggerate  so we ll see Solfarm Everything on Solana has to have large numbers  I like it Solana Max I completely agree  If we want more people to buy and stake  then we need to see an easier method to setup a node  Something like Daedalus  the wallet that cardano uses  would do wonders  As it is  I stake my Sol over Exodus  Which is fine  Still get 10  and it s much easier  But still  doesn t solve the problem of needing to be more decentralized Its going to allow you to deposit SOL and mint a novel stablecoin against the value of that SOL  We just need to make sure ftx and raydium will list our stable and give liquidity pairs and we are golden He s speaking about the solana blockchain explorer which doesn t tag with a name the addresses holding much more than 50  of the supply  the whales I do  not sure if I should put it out there so early Another 50  down u say  hope not Is there a way to designate coins based on tax lot when trying to sell  Like Highest in first out Because we re heading towards a bear market Thank you  would you reccomend one over the other Buy a ledger There are many paperhands in crypto is the only reason I can think of    Without going into details  there are many good developments in Solana  do your own DD   I think many people are in for their short term 30  40  gain  possibly overleveraged to make that a meaningful dollar amount  and missing the forest for the trees   I m just backing the truck and using their

the middle of it all  Went back into Sollet and connected Metamask and confirmed the transactions  Had to find some ETH to fund transactions on Ethereum as gas had changed  Once done  Ethereum was much faster than I remember  Still too expensive Look under USD stablecoins If I m not mistaken  Honestly converting between SPL and ETH tokens this has been my main hack  If this doesn t work lmk and I ll give you a guide on how to do it in a bit I didn t see USDC on FTX US Much more centralized than other projects like nano FYI for the future  FTX handles both natively so you can transfer either

It s in my portfolio  Thanks Thanks much  I ll look into it I think exodus wallet gets you higher staking apy than solana s solarflare wallet Haven t watched the video  I rarely  very rarely  watch crypto related videos  However  I Like Step Finance   Every time I visit their dashboard there is something new  something existing that s polished  or new info displayed   For instance  the other day I tried to use the compounding function for the STEP USDC pool     it wouldn t work  errors with my Ledger  it seems a reset command was being sent that would exit the Solana app in chrome on my chromebook and windows desktop  Just tried it again this morning  worked perfectly   Was it worth it to harvest  25 STEP and compound  Probably not   The point is  it s clear they re working hard to create a good product and Solana needs a dashboard like this to make sense of the POH ledger and derive meaningful information quickly via visual UI   Now  if only some group could develop a block network explore along the same paradigm   I m continuing to accumulate STEP  regardless of price     I like their project and what they re doing Try Brave Brower  Solved my problem Lots of liquidated

option  and Everstake  Exodus  is definitely not that   Everstake is middle of the pack in returns Source  https   stakeview app Is that Ed Sheeran after a week watching the charts Just hold if you belive in long term growth   One coin is still one coin Apricot is coming soon can t wait to see Apricot Finance and Solend working or beta testing at least  but that s coming soon at the moment only All of those networks are rubbish  Bitcoin is No1     BSC is ok    Eth is a dying network I have the same issue when I try to log in solflare  u2f errror can t access my solana tokens any advice solflare is an interface to search validators and stake Well timed video  I am currently considering buying Solana as a hedge against ETH and ICP  Good use of time stamps That s promising  have you got the name of the project so far Nice video  it s a really cool tracker for Solana wallets and the native token was something when they launched haha  you might also check ape board  seems like good projects for trackimg as well Thx  Solved it Sharding limits composability Yeah it s an interesting point because it means  speculating  on btc and Eth is fundamentally at odds with the true economic utility of the token So for BTC you can argue it becomes more like gold and so cost and time  throughput  doesn t really matter  But for the smart contract and utility focused blockchains  it s tough  I guess then you re just hoping for long term deflation Sorry I can t help you   still haven t figured it out im on exodus  its 10 24   its actually really good and super easy to do  just annoying part is when you want to sell  you have to unstake it all and it takes the 2 days  plus 4 days to restake  so i think ill only want to sell around 100s Good point  Rust is an easy and well loved language When u got liquidated  your entire fund is gone or partially  Sorry for noob question  Never touch future trading before Someone said that Solana has a  striking  feature that s missing  which is a concept that I don t fully understand but it s mentioned in the roadmap already   There s been some lockups of the whole network within this month  but it s a public beta so that s to be expectedThe full main net hasn t been launched  so I m not terribly concerned about the 700 validators or whatever   I think the very good economics of running a validator are about to show themselves by winter as usage scales upYou don t really need highly specialized hardware as much as it needs to be high spec  so it s not Ethereum where it can run off a raspberri etc   Anatoly said that as computers get faster and cheaper he doesn t see this as a long term problem   It s not even necessary right now   I mean it s nuts that you can have a 12 core cpu water cooled 300hz display phone  that sounded like complete science fiction 5 years agoI m enjoying the transparency and  just write code and get shit done  ethic of the team   I can relate to these peopleVery excited to see what comes next You can stake at binance  1  week APY Exactly people are forced to buy ether at a high price and are burning through its supply at a faster clip to perform the functions they want on the network Yes that makes sense  Noticed that too  Plus the overall Alts performance today I mean  computers are getting crazy   I can order a 128 core processor right now to play some vidya games   Who knows where computers are in 5 years Bitcoin dominance is rising just chill  Oh lmao wait  yeah thats why I dont trade futures RUST Can you explain that  You mean the fact that it s efficient means there s not as much demand as the ecosystem grows  Unlike Eth BTC that have high costs per transaction which push up the price as txs increase It helps to write down what the total market cap was on the day you bought   CmC has snapshots of this that might helpBefore you panic about the price action of a coin it helps to check that relative to the overall market   This protects my sanity 24 7 You mean pull out right above liquidate  I mean my loss would basically be close to liquidation so why not hit the liquidation rate and just lose my initial investment I use kucoin but it s only futures  Solana has their own wallet  still haven t set it up as I don t have funds to do so atm BTFD school is not essential Pass the chips mate It is great  i have done research  Its just that because its so efficient its utility is minimized FTX Eth goes down   sol goes down You should do more research on Solana  ecosystem is very If we go low  20 s again  I m stacking up the chips  SOL  amp  DOT are both on my shopping list during this correction    Cheers Yes all of them besides coinbase Especially if it s been stated out loud Thank you  good luck to you as well Where are you staking  if you don t mind me asking  Just got into Solana Resolved  Via Project Serum Telegram channel  Had to log in to Sollet  hit send again  reconnect Metamask and approve transactions  Had to add some ETH to pay for gas  Whew Welcome to crypto Both those coins will make you rich  Just continue to incrementally purchase for this simple fact  you can borrow against their value in 5 years and never have to sell a single coin I do alot of research  I watch alot of video content and analysis  Just keep it simple continue to focus on this top five  Bitcoin Ethereum  Cordano  Solana  and XRP they will win the SEC lawsuit  The rest is a crap shoot  Of course  this is not financial advice  It s my way of waiting for college football to start  Good luck Are there any major exchanges that sell solana What are some moon shots  I get too overwhelmed with the constant posts around the subs here  I have some btc and eth and not sure what else to get into Bitcoin  Ethereum  Cardono plus 15 other  moon shots  We are just at the beginning   People feel they have missed the boat  Realistically  the boat is still on the drawing table Be patient and let the process of price discovery happen Simple Thank you But he used a solana supported wallet already  I don t have the seed phrase for this solana wallet  or is it the seed phrase of my trustwallet in general    should be    but if I type in this seed phrase on sollet io to restore the wallet it doesn t work Which ones are you mostly holding  Btc I have to laugh   You could just as easily say  we don t want coin  we want paper   As unfortunately it will come down to essentials  groceries  school  transportation  paying for daycare  etc The point is  it s all relative to perceived value YaUsd rallied     it ain t over I noticed the price of SOL increased a considerable amount compared to other alt coins these past couple days   I think  there were a lot of fomo buyers due to all the recent good news of SOL and now you see the paper hands https   www reddit com r solana comments nx8bj1 how _to _select _deliverable _account _on _sollet h1ef08f Can u explain me how Very astute assessment gt is it possible to import the solana adress from trustwallet into another solana supported web wallet provider  YES  it s possible Parrot looks sick  Just what I am looking for Sorry bro  it s not financial advice     ‍ ️ Cool  thank you  I ll look into Parrot and Mercurial Uw   Also  you can buy it on Atomic wallet and you can stake it for 7 apy    I haven t tried staking it there yet tho Your FUD doesn t affect me   and did you mean to say that SOL Is on sale If your liquidation is at 26 then it s going to 25 99 before bounce the whole altcoin market is down Any word why solana is only futures on kucoin Mango will have a governance token   gt  https   docs mango markets litepaper Solana is great solana is one Parrot and Mercurial are more like MakerDAO  although parrot in particular is merging a lot of concepts into one platform https   gopartyparrot medium com announcing parrot a liquidity network for lending borrowing a5c2e4eae3f9Apricot Finance and Solend are more like Aave in this instance   pure borrowing  amp  lending markets Probably a pump and dump  It doesnt actually have much utility yet as fees are so low  I anticipate it will grow over time but could go way lower until more apps gain usage and txn vol I think they re in too deep man To many weak hands panic selling I m not very computer savvy so I m on Exodus  Literally just click a button And are Parrot and Solend like Aave Wow  thanks  Do you know if Mango Markets will have any kind of governance token I m in at 40 13  i know it can easily hit low 20s  but I m staking and holding for the longer term  1year  I m quite sure that crypto is just in a hibernation  it always go through these peaks and valleys  people forget about it  and slowly but surely it starts heading back up to break past resistances It s held its position relative to other

2021-06-13,36.51470765,39.35997513,34.78298953,Anatoly just didn t explain the protocol in layman words for everyone to understand   He is not very good inspiring the community Lady Jane Go back to Charles ‍ ️  ‍ ️Do you have a YouTube channel perhaps  I would love to get financial advice from you Why do my actions matter to you  Your ego fueled market magic   is phenomenal that s why I can t wait for a year from now Ya it looks great tbh  I can see this being a hit in Africa As Easy As This 1   Chose the Project you like Imgur  https   imgur com Agq8Zj7 2   Add your email  amp  Twitter handle  that s it  Imgur  https   imgur com MFoyu83 Does anyone know when the winners will be announced The definition of  decentralization  is totally arbitrary  as are the criteria for judging it  so you will find the word used to make any argument that anyone wants to make   It s pretty useless These things only make you money if you add value   If it s cheap easy to do  then you just get a huge proliferation of nodes  that then spread the income very thinly among them   Eventually you reach a point where the incrementally added node cannot be profitable without making an existing node unprofitable   At that point  it s zero sum except for those validators actually adding value to the network  that value then being extracted across all validators   So if you can t bring  more value  than slapping some hardware together  absolutely minimal value  hardly even worth talking about since just about  anyone  can do that   then you really aren t bringing anything to Solana at all now that you say it  yesterday I had to put again my seed to be able to access it  when normally I dont have to do it as its already open always  but maybe its that they did some kind of upgrade and thats why because i dont think its been compromised 700 is already enough in my opinion   No matter what the number is  there will always be people saying it s not enough   The line is arbitrary  totally arbitrary   With 700 you d have to control or influence so many individuals and organizations simultaneously  it s just about impossible   Sure more validators would make it even more impossible   But if it s already so difficult that making it more difficult doesn t fundamentally change the equation More validators are always welcome   But please recognize that 700 is already quite a lot  and should meet any practical definition of  acceptably decentralized I ve been a software developer for over 25 years  as in  paid to do so  10 years more if you count schooling    I ve seen a lot of languages   My feeling is that rust tends to encourage very unreadable code   That s my only real problem with it   I also think that the concept of having to declare memory ownership at function boundaries is annoying  although I understand that forcing a very strict  and cumbersome  let s be honest  memory model is one of its  features   so you kind of have to accept that just to be using the language to begin with I m not a fan  but I can see becoming productive in it with enough practice  just like any other language   Good code can come out of it as well as bad code Seems to be working Nope and it doesn t need to be  These are projects that can and will coexist Rust is very well regarded by developers in general Its known as a hard to please but fair compiler  which generates very fast code  suitable for systems programming projects  with language development run by sane people Its basically one of the best languages  period Im dev 20  years  p I still dont agree    There might be competing blockchains with solana but no longer disruptive advancements like we see with these third generation blockchains  These are close to theoretical limits  So for example latency times theoretically cant go below 50ms  That is how long it takes light to go around the earth and maximum speed of fiber optics  So maybe another blockchain can decrease this latency of solana which is 400 ms by a 2x but no more  anatoly claims he will do it himself    Throughputs are at gpu level parallelism  They will increase according to Moore s law but so will solana s throughput  algorand is same   Fees in solana are essentially proportional to  bandwidth cost since there is no proof of work and heavy computation  So again they scale at the price if internet  All in all these third generation blockchains will scale gracefully with all these tech prices  They will just have different flavors You just approved my point by trying disprove it  If Solana is that much better it means that there will be more examples of evolving blockchains coming along and killing Solana and its like   very soon  So  will the next level development be a Solana killer  Again  I doubt that  I do agree that every new level of development will replace the older ones  they will not kill them  they will force them to evolve or as you say die  So  I do agree with you that the old Ethereum will die out once the newer models come into play  but Solana wont be the Ethereum killer because it is competing with other 3rd Generation chains  of which Solana is just one I guess we are splitting hairs  Ethereum might never go  or it might evaporate as replacement technologies come in to replace it  But its not just one chain such as Solana that will kill Ethereum  It will be the entire market that replaces the older market  such as the new Windows 10 which is now the standard in comparison to DOS  it does not matter how blockchains are written  it matters how they are replaced  If an older blockchain is slower and more expensive in comparison to newer ones then its not just a matter of its disappearing  its a matter of the clients using the chain moving from one to another or for the chain owners to  maybe also split up  create a new chain  not necessarily a fork  look at Polka vs Eth But the point is this is a blockchain not a tech company and these analogies are flawed  Once u wrote the blockchain code and its live u cant  upgrade  it  Upgrades are essentially forks  Something ethereum is trying to do since 2016  with eth2 0  and it still has not happened  Basically the blockchain you use now is the same as 6 years ago  There are now third generation blockchains such as avax  sol  near  algorand that are orders of magnitude better than ethereum  Orders of magnitude is 1000000cheaper  100x faster etc  This is not a 20 percent improvement  or a 2x improvement  This is extinction level stuff  I dont think we will ever see eth2 0 upgrade because its just hard to do and considering that even with sharding u can t be better than any if these chains i mentioned in ANY criterion  I see maybe ethereum becoming a store of value chain like btc  With application going to its layer 2 subnets Essentially what might happen is ethereum base layer becoming the settlement layer for its many and fragmented layer 2 scaling solutions  Either this or it truly dies and defi will move to faster more scalable chains  Ethereum community is being too blind I mMad overwhelmed Okay so I guess I m just having a hard time understanding why you have an issue with a 2 day lockup  in case your paper instincts kick in and you want to panic sell  if you have such faith In the Ivestment   If you have no faith in the investment   get your scared money out   That s pretty simple toMe  But you are ico  ‍  excuse me  mr  Sir  You know exactly how to handle this  forgive myFruitless remarks I wouldn t be comfortable with it flipipng Ethereum until slashing is finished  because right now slashing is centralized  Also a lot of the foundation tokens need to be distributed  Maybe next bullrun The only time competition stops is when something evolves to a point where it no longer competes  Such as homo sapiens and apes  Even Google with all it power has not killed Microsoft or Baidu  and DOS did not kill Apple OS  nor did Linux kill Windows  There are larger and smaller markets for all  let me jut state that Solana is far from being an  extinction event  for Ethereum What trade offs Latency is 400ms compared to eth2 0  cardano  polkdaot s 3 5s  Throughout is 50k compared to cardano  polkadot s sub 5k and eth2 0s 20k  Fees are 1000000 times less than ethereum and 1000 times less than cardano and polk  If this isnt disruption I dont know what is     Fees will remain orders if magnitudes lower even if solana 100xs in price  Max throughout will scale as gpus get better at a current rate of 2x per 2 3 years  Latency is already close to an optimal of 50 100ms which is speed of light around earth and improving There are other advantages im not even mentioning Turns out I had no  SOL in my wallet  Dumb  Leaving this here for anyone who needs it long on red short on green Ethereum is not inferior  Solana makes different trade offs  They will coexist for a long time You have a point   its more like how Facebook killed Myspace   the question is  will everyone jump ship to Solana or will they stay on Ethereum   The answer to that is how Solana will maintain low fees  fast transitions and expand its capabilities  If Solana is a Google style tech then it will take the majority of the market  BUT the market is not 2 dimensional  You have Polka  Cardano and many more that hope to replace Ethereum  So in my opinion  Solana is more like a  Twitter  or  TikTok  in that it will gain a large following but will it eradicate its competitors  I doubt this at the moment  maybe next year my concept will change as the market changes No I bought it when it was at 30 a few weeks ago sold my investment for  120 profit  not including my initial investment  waited fir a dip  it went up then nownits crashing again  well kinda leveled now There s no way to transfer SOL from the uphold wallet SOL   gt  Dave   gt  Cathie Wood   Elon lol Competition always brings the best and I think both blockchains will incite each other to advance and develop to coexist  ️ I m having trouble unstaking harvesting Ray on Raydium with phantom wallet  It looks like the transaction that get s created is erroring out Here s the console output

capitalization  10 200 419 687  No  13 on CoinGecko You re talking about Hedera Hashgraph  HBAR Nina is cool too  It s like putting vinyl records on chain  super cool if ur a music nerd haaha Is this the same error as   the security key doesnt look familiar    Is there a work around   I tried the allow auto sign and it still pops up with this  Im using Windows 10 and tried on all the browers  even Edge    Same error on all of them Hi  What is your current market capitalization Please how many projects built on solana project have not done a seed phrase restore on sollet but i would check your wallet address on  https   solanabeach io   https   solanabeach io  type in your public wallet id  and go to the bottem and click on  portfolio   URL should be    https   solanabeach io address  your

0 salary and incentive works better than such an awkward offer  Good luck I have been getting my hands on developing on Solana  Believe me guys  they are nowhere near Solidity  Too many issues     Poor docs    Makes everything look too complex Way lower mate 0 001 cent I m sorry  you can only exchange for it Check the SOL BTC chart  pretty much the same with most alt coins lately  Even ETH BTC has been suffering This has been the current sentiment for alt coins since last BTC drop The main issue with Solana is not tech but community building  May be a tweak in tokenomic can bootstrap it The best one is the Freeton  Www freeton org yes Omg  This man is a genius  SOL is revelationary  This goes far beyond my understating and worries about price action Yes Yes Yes Yes Don t reply when you

major project to reduce BTC influence  and even then  it will still retain its central role as the goto coin due to its self realized perceived relational emotional impact I wasn t able to find it in Atomic Wallet  Any advice Well said I couldn t agree more  The only thing I desire is for Bitcoin dominance to drop significantly and the overall market to be more spread out instead of one having majority control  I believe in the long term a drop in bitcoin dominance would be extremely healthy for all blockchains  Bitcoin is holding back the next generation of technology much like big oil in the energy sector  It never fails  greed always wins over progress Same problem i am facing bro how can solve it Yes asking direct questions to people who have actual experience is called research

death of another  Is Toyota the Honda Killer    Nope  There are 6 billion people on the plant  Ethereum has under 100 nodes and less than 13 million blocks   so work out the maths  Solana is currently much smaller  and yes  it will one day overtake Ethereum  just as another blockchain in the near future will come and overtake Solana   and then there is Polka  Cardano and a couple of hundred other chains being built out there  No one chain will be a  killer  there will always be room for more projects and chains  Just as there is room for more blogs and opinions Shot you a couple messages

realize that Solana solves zero technical issues compared to ETH  They have no innovation  apart from being centralized and having high speeds  Don t lecture me about who s the problem in crypto  the likes of you are supporting shitty blockchains You re literally spamming this shitcoin on hundreds of subs and now giving unsolicited financial advice  Please do less and realize you re part of the problem in crypto Sell Solana  stop making SBF richer and make yourself richer passively Bro wtf this isn t r cryptomoonshots  Mods ban this chump Because building a quantum computer is incredibly

more high quality projects enter the ecosystem But their main business is something totally different You go straight to the source  Simple as that  If a market has been created for that token  you d imagine the devs would be more than helpful in trying to share it It doesn t matter what  people imagine   It matters what the formal definitions of distributed systems terminology is  If you can t even agree on the formal language then all of the blockchain papers people have come up with in the industry are meaningless I m all for finding creative uses and solving interesting problems with cryptocurrency but honestly Soldate seems really fucking stupid What market problem is this addressing  Why does this need to happen on the blockchain This just makes Solana  a crypto I m a big fan of  and the broader crypto market look bad IMO Hydra swap already having a version to try before you invest is amazing with so many options and uses it like a decentralised Swiss Army knife DEXs are starting to level up their game to really overtake CEXs  Looks like hydraswap is setting the bar high  limit orders  built in arbitrage modules  tradingview charts etc  Plus its on solana the fastest blockchain out thereThe fact they have an alpha version out already makes me extremely bullish  Majority of new projects have an idea and no real product at this stage  Hope i get my hands on this early Looks like all of them dipped during that time An incredible dex  offering tools found in no other competitor  Hydraswap seems to have a very promising future  Still a great project presented and supported by Blockdesk Ventures It actually went through but I had some issues with Metamask connection  I had to reconnect Metamask and then approve the transactions inside Metamask  So it went through  thankfully   But I should have done a test amount first  First rule of transfer likely screwed to the maximum of what you tried to send   be careful bro Especially as Soldat is a german origin word for soldier how can i connect it to my existing solana wallet  When I try to restore with  the passphrase  it creates another account withouth my funds    RN I have some funds stuck in solflare even though they show correctly on solanabeach  i d like to manage them somewhere else amp  x200B thanks   D Finally a DEX that looks great in many aspects  love the advanced trading view Haha that s a nice way to put it i guess   But yeah improvements from here will be more marginal I would ve been liquidated so no I think you were reading something else Thanks There are block explorers who tag s big whales and identify who are they  what their intentions etc  Good projects tag themselves beforehand  Solana is not doing this  And it HAS some WHALE issues You know what I am talking about  Exactly Damn lmao dude spoke it into existence  Shit crashed to  15 this morning at like 4am   Sold all his sol and now it s almost back to 40  Sucks to sucks Don t listen to him  those exchanges are fine what are the issues vs solidity I bought the top Man   they really missed a huge opportunity to call the website company  SolMate  Like   how obvious is that Eh  what wait list I d recommend using tradingview to check on prices if you re using a mobile app   Coinmarketcap sucks balls on the mobile app when it comes to updating its pricing That said I ve decided today Solana is going to be my one multi year crypto   I ve moved my 10 Solana to a paper wallet  sealed it into a air bubble and put it into a safe in a location far away from here I just wanted to see if I m off the eternal waitlist yet Ufff  great stack  Hope to be there one day I like solana related project and already sen it making some moves At this point  I don t think there will ever be extinction events for any major chain  Like I said  blockchain is a different animal and the fact that value is stored  there will be thousands that hold on to their tokens  However  there will be a liquidity drain as users and capital flock to the ecosystem with the most liquidity and speed  This is already happening to ETH via Polygon and BSC  It may or may not be Solana overtaking all  this is generally speaking  It s just that Solana has the best infrastructure to potentially support that level of adoption for the reasons I mentioned previously  If you disagree  I d love to hear of another chain that would compete I don t know of this is related  but about at the same time a coin named PRiVCY went from 0 01 to more than 3000    42141928  in the last 24hrs   at least this is reported in my accounting app The only thing that s scary on Solflare is the possibility of user error Anyone tried Atomic Wallet   looking for advice Yahoo Finance has ALGO going from 1 27 to 0 34 in manner of seconds lol Gives staking your delegator a whole new meaning CoinMarketCap had some technical issues https   twitter com CoinMarketCap status 1404380113383432194 My 20000 cardano said   this morning I about died Oh so it s just glitched  Lol I guess it s good knowing I didn t miss anything You can t lol  It s  16 on CMC but it still have market price on other exchanges Hello for more then a month i undelagate my Sol token from delegation  And I cannot withdrawl them  Doesnt have withdraw button for it  I stake it on ledger  Any help Did anyone else notice how solana dropped to  16 for a few minutes today or is it just me I saw it was at  16 too but I m sad I didn t buy any when it was at that price     I m wondering how it got to  16 and why lol Had a  guh  moment just before when I opened Exodus Or use CoinGecko like any sane person  D CoinMarketCap seems to be having issues with price reporting today  I think we might see alot of almost heartattacks yeh CoinMarketCap showed DOGE at  0 09 this morning  Some sort of weirdness going on with price trackers exodus is all sorts of jacked up right now too Right I saw that I wonder what the hell is going on I wanted to buy it at  16 which was just minutes ago Just saw that wanted to buy some at  32 if that was the actual price  Something weird is going on with a lot of prices right now  My brain is moosh right now Solana is coming on in leaps and bounds right now  This new Dex offing by HydraSwap is covering a lot of bases and solving some of the problems endemic of blockchain   for example gas fees and interoperability across blockchains  The arbitrage capability is novel and impressive  I m intrigued to see how well this works when it goes live Solana is going to be a game changer in the block chain industry Hydraswap as a Dex will be great been on Solana Great product being built in Solana  they haven t started with marketing yet or at least I haven t found much info but from the team expertise I can assume it s just a matter of time  All in all it s like the third generation of DEXs and 100  a long term hold project  Really looking forward to this sale  will join your private investment too so thanks for sharing I ve seen a fair few decentralized exchanges on different blockchains and I must say  HydraSwap beats many of them even while still being in alpha stage  No doubt    u hydraswap_io is building a crucial component for the  DeFi in general and for the  solana ecosystem specifically  You should listen to the guy and grab an opportunity to join HydraSwap project early with both hands I m happy with the investment in SOl   I am keen to maximum those holdings  staking might not be the best way to do that   you have provided nothing so thanks for wasting my time   your attitude sinks  like some weird cult follower So it s prostitution Nice answer  so in your opinion blockchains cannot improve performance  In other words it has reached its nadir of evolution and we stand before a veritable God in code form We must be near the top again Maybe you reward your date with the coin when they are great the sex  Then when they have many coins  they will be millionaire and attract more dates and get more of the coin from the sex Token starting price is   00015 Aside from storing data on the chain  what exactly does this dating platform need crypto for   Most of the problems it proposes to solve are  solved   or not really solved  as is more likely from what I read  by specific function of an app  not through anything crypto related Why does it need a governance coin   To me that just shouts  we re just hoping to get rich off of an ICO    I don t think there is likely any utility to a coin associated with this project   Just make a good service  we don t need yet another coin gt localStorage setItem  warning close account   true Hi  I m having the same issue  I m following the steps  but after pasting the code and pressing enter in the console  the option is not coming up to delete the account  Any idea why  Thanks slashing not finished  therefore the consensus not decentralized yet  The Solana Foundation is still selling tokens way below market price to VCs  being a validator requires about 100 000 SOL to be profitable because the fees for voting are so high  ultra low transaction fees implies there will be less demand for SOL as an asset  nodes basically need to run in data centers  bandwidth requirements are far too high for typical cable residential ISPs  validator nodes need 128 GB RAM and a  1000 CPUThe validator requirements FUD is the most often mentioned but it s the weakest FUD  You can t expect the fastest blockchain in the world to run on ghetto hardware over dialup internet  This isn t Bitcoin Core nor is it trying to be what is it with r solana and 1990s web blinkenlights   I need my sunglasses on when visiting this sub Great chat    but bad clickbait title Solana newbie here  so this was a good intro  tbh problem with so many projects is not enough focus      too many cooks spoil the broth  Good example would be step finance To make surego to explorer solana com and enter your address and click on tokens tabIf you see your tokens there then you are safeotherwise you are probably hackedTo see if you are hacked or not check you recent transactions and see if there are any outgoing transactionsIf there are outgoing transactions then the hack is confirmedotherwise there s still a chance to recover the tokens I have no idea what s going on here joke We can view Ethereum as Netscape in the 90s Competition is good for both This is extreme max growth  It s crazy  That means people want to build on you ecosystem this is why the token names and tickers should be stored on the blockchain  like Ethereum does it Whoever decided not to store it on the blockchain made a huge mistake
2021-06-15,40.53583999,41.75867325,39.43581269,First of all  the vc s are not  turning around and investing money into Solana   The Solana foundation is selling their SOL for cash which they can then use to grow the ecosystem and improve the tech  Now  as to why they would do this instead of selling to the greater market at market value  there are 2 reasons  First  it doesn t dilute the market  When you have private sales to vc s  the lockup periods as well as the off the books nature of the sale mean that there is virtually no market effect  And second  it s good publicity to hear that there are very rich  intelligent people investing in your project  To clarify  I m not saying that I agree with their reasoning  I m just explaining what it probably is I had the same issue  I just tried refreshing the page and it seemed to work https   www metaplex com If in the US you can buy and stake your SOL on the Exodus wallet  The rewards are 10     not bad at all  I ve been doing it for months  Love getting free SOL You were making some point about selling equity vs selling tokens which just wasn t relevant  If your point is to state all the positive benefits of bringing VCs into the mix I ll just have to point you to every other discussion  I don t feel like beating a dead horse Think you got lost on the way to r cryptomoonshots If you read the entire explanation I gave earlier  you d have known that VC  s bring a lot more to the table than just money So do it  Sol has a huge market  No need to sell it at a discount to VCs SOL need to be converted into real money Hard to short a company which is not publicly traded  Do you know a way to borrow shares of the company from the founders or their venture  vulture  capitalists and sell them gt now you go for a round of fundingSolana already is funded with Sol Ummm let me try  assume you are the owner of Solana  you have X amount of equity in the company  You also have y amount of Solana coins  Now you go for a round of funding  you get an investor on board but obviously the investor won t just give you the money  networking and resources for free  you have to give back something too  This is traditionally a percentage of the company s equity  But instead if you have tokens than you can give the investor tokens instead  This way you hand over lesser equity  as compared to not giving tokens  or possibly no equity depending on the deal being brokered The downside is that as the owner and as the investor everyone is betting the company will grow and thus the value of Solana coins tokens will also grow exponentially  In which case you are giving more value than the value of the tokens  But the upside is you hold greater equity in the company  meaning greater decision making power as far as future plans go as well as anyway increasing your own net worth with the growth of the company You re going to have to explain to me the relevance of the question you re asking Would you rather dilute equity or sell the tokens for funding Wut Mods  please ban this clown Think  as a start up would you rather sell tokens or dilute your shares This smells dodgy  https   twitter com cryptotillitblo status 1404391525128314885 s 21 old thread i know  but  sonar watch  https   sonar watch  now lets you mint nfts  i heard it was kind of expensive to do on solible  looks like more options are on the way If a little more money now can make a lot more money with the competitive edge this money will buy  this is money well invested I doubt that s the case  And if it is  it can t last for more than a few minutes due to arbitrage  i e  the mere possibility of making money by exploiting the difference in prices makes prices converge Tbh I got so excited when I saw that I didn t realize until the first person commented You should mention the national restrictions You can stake SOL with the Exodus wallet FWIW Surprised they didn t include raydium as well    SOL  SRM  and RAY seem to be the big 3 of the ecosystem Yeah  I got to get me some Kusama Kraken is such a quality exchange  One of the only ones I ll use along with FTX KSM DOT is the only reason I even use kraken None of the good stuff ever is    can t even buy FTT on FTX for us customers haha Thanks bro Use SolanaBeach for research  The one I found is legit Thanks for this had mine sitting on exodus  any risks in using a small 0  validator FYI  I just learned that the 10 ish percent they show is kinda BS       If you read the Solana staking FAQ the number they show in the screen is different from the actual rate    https   support exodus com article 1551 solana staking faq  https   support exodus com article 1551 solana staking faq Actual yield right now is 7  minus 7  fees     https   everstake one solana  https   everstake one solana Shown yield in Exodus UI   10 2  which they explain here  https   support exodus com article 1523 what is apy  https   support exodus com article 1523 what is apy  gt In Exodus  we display an estimated APY    What this means is that behind the scenes  Exodus is looking at data from many different staking pools  and using this information to find an average that is displayed to you   So    No it isn t 10   thanks to a user in another post for teaching me this     Probably ALL of Exodus  APYs are suspect as shown in the UI Currently staking SOL on FTX up to 10  Surprised Kraken is looking at 6 5  Thanks for sharing Oh wow  Exodus  UI is super dishonest    I just found the page that says they delegate to everstake and the number they show in the UI is kind of the fair market rate you COULD get People are trading on the SolPunks discord but marketplaces are coming soon  They are all minted and sold out now No one smart is going to hold it against Sol that it got pumped up by Cramer VC funding is about much more than the dollars  It s about building out a set of long term commercial partnerships  not to mention significant commercial credibility  This is very good for Solana and the token price  even more so than reflected in the immediate price bump They use Everstake  search for them here https   www stakeview app   Currently 6 79  with 10  commission Plus they use the Everstake pool which takes 4   Move your SOL over to SolFlare wallet  use SolanaBeach to search for validator with 0  fees  Use that validator in SolFlare when staking your SOL What   Where do you get that from Unfortunately Kraken not allowing SOL trading in US for some reason When Eth was that young it s didn t have 7000 developers like Solana does Pretty annoying  At least they let me trade stake DOT and KAVA Kraken is larger then Binance US That s probably true but from what I understand Solana is way further ahead then EOS ever was  Didn t EOS only have   20 validators Solana has   640  Also Solana has VCs like Alameda Research and Jump Trading who are market making on the Serum DEX  I wasn t around back then but from what I understand EOS had very little community development  Idk if you heard but Solana recently had its hackathon with 200  projects competing  Obviously not all will come to fruition but that shows great community interest imo Better rates are available on binance if you can access it It s literally a currency for currency transaction I d say they were quite uncommon until recently  Aside from this recent surge  the last VC funding type of deals directly with the blockchain founders was like EOS  which turned out pretty poorly I think its unlikely Solana is set to distribute  300 million all at once  W  a market cap of  10 billion   300 million spread across a year really wouldn t  move the needle at all I think the advice is being a bit overplayed Side note  just pointing out how much money  300m is to raise  At least as far as startup life is concerned  that s some late stage   IPO dough Solana is going to be listed on kraken on the 17th  I just received the mail First of all  sorry if my swearing offended u  What are these quid pro quos that u can think of  My point was that these things are exactly uncommon and imo there s no reason to expect terrible shit to happen  I agree that the devs had some pretty shit transparency about this lately Why are you swearing lol   gt The developers sell coins at a discount to VCs with a lock up period and VCs give advice to the devsI m saying that this is an assumption  no  I can think of a ton of quid pro quos that could exist in such deals  Its clear to me the days of caring about transparency are long gone  Just make number go up  To each their own What the fuck is your question anymore  I was only trying to say that private funding rounds like this take place  The developers sell coins at a discount to VCs with a lock up period and VCs give advice to the devs  Nobody is forcing u to buy and use SOL lol Its not a big assumption to assume what sort of deals are being made behind the scenes because some other blockchains make deals behind the scenes good news Think of the VC funding round as a way for Solana to establish strategic partnerships while also raising capital to fund their projects  The sold tokens are meant to provide the VCs with  skin in the game  so they are incentivized to align with Solana Labs  goals It s really not a big assumption this stuff happens with projects quite often  Not so sure about them getting a steep discount like you re suggesting tbh  I wouldn t be surprised if they got one but not as much as you re suggesting  Also they aren t giving up equity these are CryptoCURRENCIES not stocks Exodus isn t 10   it s 6 75 If you are in US  and not the kind of person who uses VPN to act like you aren t  then the easiest staking option IMO is using Exodus Wallet    Also 10 I like to do all my direct SOL buys on FTX for this reason    Plus I prefer the UI over Binance Solana is paying for credibility and recognition  Attaching the name to Andressen Horowitz and Polychain Capital among others   They are getting quick immediate funding  advisors and access to further capital and many high net worth accredited investors What s your stake account address Just go to  https   solanabeach io   https   solanabeach io   and paste it in the search box  Then check the  Stake Rewards  tab at the bottom  Should have your stake reward history there with APR numbers as well    If nothing s showing up there  make sure the  Delegation  section shows that your stake account is actively delegated    Validators and Stakers are rewarded every  Epoch   Each Epoch lasts   3 days  Use a dashboard like solanabeach to keep track of the current epoch s progress   You should see a reward payout every Epoch unless you re staked with a Validator whose fee is 100 nice Interesting The Solana foundation  which owns Solana Labs  is a non profit tps on solana is far higher  65000 vs 5000   Also fees on ADA are estimated to be significantly higher than solana  obviously dependent on how congested the network is Did you just make those terms up  Is Solana a for profit Yes but the part I also struggle with is the amount of tokens coming to circulation and combined with extremely low fees  this becomes an inflationary token  Can anyone clarify low burn rate concerns That s a pretty big assumption  So selling to VCs at a likely steep discount to then have VCs obtain equity in all these startups is better than selling at market as needed and providing funding to the startups without giving up ownership Like the other guys said they likely get other benefits like advice  Also if they did sell a alot at once they could crash the price and that wouldn t look good I mean the VCs they sold to   2 are actually trading firms  have great track records  I phrased it that way because lots of time in crypto that s not the case  Sino for example specializes in helping the projects they invest in grow in the Chineese market and are experts in that But I would say yes I would guess they do need the  300 m all at once otherwise I doubt they would have done this  They are trying to strike while the irons hot I think the price of these coins should be public information though The terms 1  If solana price rises  they make money2  If it doesn t  they lose money gt  With the new resources  Solana Labs will launch an incubation studio to accelerate the development of decentralized applications and platforms building on Solana  alongside a venture investing arm and trading desk dedicated to the Solana ecosystem   https   solana com news solana labs completes a 314 15m private token sale led by andreessen horowitz and polychain capitalThey don t have much leverage  fundamentally Yo   I invested my life savings in SOL   What s going on Theoretically a lot could motivate such deals  unless you have documentation The coins are likely locked up  a reasonable assumption  and will be  dumped on the market  eventually  Did Solana need all  300 million at once  Wouldn t a far better scenario just include selling Sol as needed  at market value rather than a likely steep discount  a reasonable assumption  and grant funds to ecosystem devs rather than have a VC having its claws in the ownership of all these projects The VCs theoretically provide strategic advice or other services to Solana as well  You are arguing that they should of just dumped about 7 5 million coins on the market instead  That would of tanked the price  They sell then to VCs and slowly unlock them over time To your edit  gt What would the terms look like to youNot sure what you re asking  the terms would look like whatever they are  I think itd be good to know the terms of such things Is Solana Labs a for profit  I guess I don t even know that If buying with cash  Ftx us in the USA  ftx com elsewhere  If buying with crypto  raydium io It does  As I mentioned above SRM makes sense not SOL This is a list from Krakens website of coins they restrict trading on in the US  How many others are layer one besides XRP    Cannot deposit  hold  or trade ANKR  BNT ENJ  EWT  FLOW  GHST  GRT  LPT  MATIC  MINA  MKR  RARI  REN  SAND  SOL  SRM  SUSHI or ZRX     Cannot trade XRP No idea what that means lol  All good  I just personally think there should be much more transparency around these VC deals when it comes to public networks We re only here now because junkies wanted to shoot up without leaving the house I don t know  have you tried Googling for the funds who bought  What would the terms look like to you  do they have to disclose any mentoring  Any contact As I say  there s non tangible benefits that established VCs bring in the form of contacts and other investments  It s definitely better than selling to anonymous people when you add in that you don t lose equity like a traditional company That s my entire question lol  They already own the tokens and could sell them as needed to fund their own ecosystem So Solana gets to sell tokens without giving up equity  Cool  right  That s the benefit of tokenised blockchain startups Wow  This is huge I d certainly hope that s a terrible analogy for the sake of Solana You sell equity as a means to give up ownership of your company in return for money  Its not currency for currency  It s obviously clear why the VCs would take the deal that s not my questioning I d certainly hope that s a terrible analogy for the sake of Solana You sell equity as a means to give up ownership of your company in return for money  Its not currency for currency I don t know how to explain the process any clearer  You can individually buy some stock in a private startup  but you have to invest enough to make it worth its while  VCs have money and do this  hoping that the value of the company  or constituent parts  increase They ll try and help the company grow as they ve got skin in the game Considering it has a 10 billion market cap  I d say yes  Also don t necessarily see a need for access to  300 million all at once I don t think they will be immediately be able to trade this Sol  though  It will be locked for a period of timeAnd like the other person says  cash is much more liquid than Sol You know someone in the market for 300 million dollars of Solana It s also about networking   these VCs will bring contacts for use by solana  like they do with startups There is a market for Sol  no You can t rent an office with Solana  you can with dollars  VCs have swapped cash for tokens like they d swap cash for stock  If the stock  tokens  appreciate  then they re in money But they give them Sol that is not in circulation and will be locked for an x period of time Just walk through it  Solana Labs has Sol tokens worth  X  They sell those Sol tokens to VC firms for less than  X  The VC firms then invest  X back into Solana  That  as is  makes absolutely zero sense  What am I missing  Why wouldn t Solana just use the tokens its already has to invest in its own ecosystem as opposed to selling it at a discount for some other 3rd party to invest in its ecosystem VC s are betting that Solana will be successful and that the token price will appreciate  They fund Solana Labs and get some perks  Solana Labs is able to use this money to fund development and to line their pockets  Both parties benefit Why would this not be available in the US   Seems arbitrary at this point Right and SOL is founded by a bunch of guys from CA and trades on Binance US already  Don t see why it wouldn t also be available to US customers on Kraken it s owned by Payward Inc which is based out of San Francisco SRM makes sense because even FTX whose team is behind Serum does not allow SRM trading the US for whatever regulatory reason  likely related to tax reporting for p and l on the dex   SOL is a different story and is widely available in the US closes Kraken app loli always forget their new  announcements  always have   not available for the largest markets on the planet right now   disclaimer at the bottom Well then closes Coinbase app    opens Kraken app gt  SOL and SRM trading and staking is not available for residents of the US  Canada  Japan and Australia at this time sigh Don t think you can on FTX US HUGE Yes  it is safe  FTX Alameda SBF are all backing SOL so they have large vested interests in making this a safe gateway 3 min might be better Bless you Deposits and staking live  trading starts Thursday Is this ftx com or ftx us Yes 10  yoy What s the interest rates of staking SOL I m not finding it anywhere As of now  no you can t for sure  but also remember ETH is used by 90  of people currently right now  so its a slow process for solana  plus solana is more for DeFi and the stock market that they want to change possibly a house or condo complexes for our digital land HHahahahasha my guy  Lmao Hands down the best comment in crypto reddit history     ️ ️ ️ engine use won t be impossible at 5 minutes I am also getting this error when trying to undelegate from Melea on SolFlare   I want to move my funds  Any help we re

think the shib just caught me off guard having not remember putting that one hahaha Dude  or dude et  keep it rolling Hahaha you made me smile so it s all blessings fam Next max keizer will be shilling it That s some bullshit I needed that laugh this morning I have a smooth brain Interesting to check this thread out in another 5 years and see what happened I don t disagree with you because our company project left Ethereum and moved over to Solana and we are currently rebuilding our entire structure with Solana  As for other chains that compete  I am sure there are  it all comes down to marketing  There have been many great developments throughout time that got lost in history due to bad marketing I thought he was just another talking head retard on t v but Cramer seems to actually know what he s talking about  Solana is a solid project A fantastic Solana based project  Our eyes have been opened to the endless possibilities in Solana based project and BlockDesk ventures is a great project to look out for  To the moon A great project with arbitrage capabilities  The future is bright with this project with such an amazing team of experts whose also behind some successful projects  If this projects succeed this would be a huge step to decentralisation ETH2 0 will never come out  even if it does Solana is still 10x faster and 100x cheaper Cool  How do you pay fee u vredditdownloader There are really nice and promising projects out there  already kept my eye on a couple of those That s really nice to witness Solana expanding and growing with such events  really great that they hold hackathons every season Maybe they will evaluate the code or the development so far Very true Lol also the smooth brain starter pack includes these text shortcuts 1   when moon   2  is now a good time to buy   3  guys I sent to wrong address how I get back   ️4  do you guys think now I sell  5  where can I buy this coin  6  I own every meme coin  7  imagine when shib hits 1  guys     8  lol BTC is old tech  9  safemoon is my best investment  Lmao I m retarded  I laughed typing these tho Is Phantom the first wallet compatible with 3D NFTs  Phantom rocks again The one person with a brain in this sub It shows that it did for a few minutes  on my coinbase and exodus account I believe  smooth brains  is jargon for people unwilling to press more than a single button to trade To clarify  his mind was blown on coke    and then he did an interview about Solana Smooth brains gt https   ftx us  a 2991413Just came across your link  I will use yours I could see it  the two brands would be very compatible  Especially since the whole ideology behind Solana s Proof of History is that it can rely on Moore s Law for the network to continuously improve in tandem with the rapid development of better faster chips SOL is the best one out there  Literally every respected crypto god is bullish on it  just listen to some of the developers coming on Mo Fi and Unchained   Only one of my investments I can see go X20 I have this wierd feeling we will see an NVIDIA and Solana partnership in the future  I dunno how or why but I do  Doesn t make sense now but something about these two brands I totally agree  This is why I invested long ago  You can tell he s extremely smart technically but also socially  He has a bit of a big head when it comes to Solana but it s compelling because he s so sure of what he built  He truly believes nothing can compete It really isn t just that Solana s tech is awesome  Anatoly is an extremely concise and effective communicator and can explain Solana s benefits and real world applications in a way that people can easily comprehend and get excited about  Plenty of innovative tech fails because the people who create it don t know how to sell it  I totally believe that he can will take Solana to the stratosphere I understand you  but the comparison is a fallacy  It s remind me that fallacy of non wanting to vote back in France and boomers throwing   peOplE DieD fOR uR RigHt   Anyway  we have the same aspiration and hope for the best I guess Good interview   Solana is one of the most underrated cryptos out there  glad Cramer is onboard This was brilliant This is awesome  A hardcore Solana Labs follower  This interview was absolutely fantastic  I m targeting a 1k price mark by EOY  Great work Solana and Mad Money team This is kind of a dealbreaker for solana   I like staking with Ada because you can just keep adding to the same staked wallet Umm what   What world does solana need eth 2 to come out for it to go up Good because I think I bought in close to the ATH lol Dude just take the W  We all can t be neckbeards and stay in the basement forever  Solana needs mainstream exposure to increase market cap  Just last week I saw Boomers on CNBC recommending 10  of portfolios be in crypto  This is a good thing that they ve only recently gotten around to  Just because Cramer is talking about Solana doesn t mean the integrity of the coin is in jeopardy  The cream always eventually rises to the top how do you sell them I d expect to see this utilizing HoloChain network then Solana  https   holochain org I think it s pretty bad  He s mostly advertises stocks in which large Hedgefonds are highly invested  That probably means we got a new    And so the extrem dump and pump begins He is an excellent way for wealthy centralised interest to push there agenda and promote their assets I understand why it s being done and why they do it  I also understand it s beneficial in an economical way to the project BUT not the only way  and I can only voice my concern about such a personnageEdit  solana will prevail because the tech is awesome  eventually it will come out by legitimate means  having some shilling clown on CNBC the like of Cramer actually make me less confident in Solana I would  but Uphold won t let me send Solana to external wallets  Felt the need to announce that here  I ll come back and send you  5 to account for inflation once I get FTX running and dump Uphold That s my point    I don t know enough about staking  risks  benefits  pro cons  hence asking questions  Until u chime in with  get your scared money away  Buoyant Know it all  pillar of the community  total twat These were questions to help you figure out why you re not seeing rewards He s not there yet  our Cramer  He says any reduction in energy use is an improvement on Bitcoin   err no  Still  he s made great progress in such a short time for an old dude Lol  I paid  19  Bought my SOL during the crash True  But I m glad Solana didn t get on coinbase in May  There was no volume to push it along  Now would be a good time for them to finally list Solana now they re is a bit of hype Hey  I think its an innovative use case  Not everything has to be finance  It doesn t need blockchain for other problems to solve  The biggest utility is that it brings more people close to the crypto world  That s enough win for me already Yes that s what they are open about it  It s no secret  rather perfectly inspired and crafted  Sol for solana and date for the token  and it rhymes with soul mate Hey  I don t think it s a stupid idea but rather pretty innovative  For mass acceptance of crypto  it is important for it to find its way in our day to day lives  This is a perfect way of introducing more people to crypto who perhaps have never used it before Shoes Coingecko It seems like there s bullish sentiment from VCs Whales over Solana  I ve seen influencers saying everyone talked about BTC ETH and SOL during Bitcoin Miami  This along side the massive investment from Anderseen  I think silicon valley is more bullish on it than retail thinks  Just my observation and so of course this now spread to CNBC Cramer must ve bought some SOL prior to running the show lol He s been talking about crypto a LOT over the last few months  He had a segment about tether on mad money last week as well  On squawk on the street they cover Bitcoin and ethereum every day That guy doesn t even blink This guy is a clown  not sure that s the best publicity LOL so true Enunciation  Cramer  E nun ci a tion Was he hoping for something else Let s give  60 worth of SOL to this guy lol what are you talking about  SOL is great  but those other projects are doing great  Not sure about XRP  lol lt 3 Thank you so much for this upload  you rock holy fucking shit were going to the moon Jim Cramer usually doesn t talk about crypto  this is quite surprising and amazing that now he talked about SOL  SOL is my 3rd biggest holding in my crypto portfolio after my BTC  amp  ETH  I strongly believe this SOL perhaps oneday may outpower ETH  however I don t sell my ETH though Similar to owning stock in a company  Can actually be a  programmable  investment Depends of course Like him or not  he s an excellent way to reach out to normies  If you re an investor in Solana getting on Mad Money is huge If Jim Cramer is talking about Solana it ll get shorted in no time F Kramer  But I m all for this this Only a matter of time I only told you bc you asked lol  8  commission fee and it appears to be active non delinquent Don t tell me   Look it up yourself  Solanabeach io validators yeah  things being put on that exchange is definitely good  regardless buying and staking for a few months or years is definitely a good thing to do i think  but currently Solana is following with ETH  so any news that hits ETH will make solana go up  ETH 2 0 comes out  thisll go up too  eventually when its also on CB and we get some more big solana news of some sort maybe it could hit some crazy big highs    but who knows  i know eth can reach 3800 ina  few months again I can only imagine the late nights that man has had helping put this all together  Excited to see where this goes Amp went up 45  today jus Bc of Coinbase smh I m starting to join the crowd pushing for cb just Bc so many smooth brains rely on cb to buy as u said   we need that entry Stake fish delegator Delegated to stake fish Good man   I will Check the commission fee on the validator you selected  check the validator on solanabeach io if it s delinquent  did you even properly stake with a validator not just create a stake account Mine only took a few days   also depends on who you staked with Jim Cramer is of the worst kind though Guys forget the moon solana is the diamond in the rough btc dead eth dead xrp dead solana is king I got you fam when I get home  I ll send some something The full interview only available to CNBC pro Why how did you pay  30 solana needs to get on coinbase  it still hasn t been put on   its missing alot of volume since its not on there  and people dont entirely know how to buy besides that He always looks like that  Face of a veteran engineer lol I dont think anyone involved with Solana sleeps  Look at Sam Friedman I paid  30 to share this  Could ya atleast tip me  1 lolSOL  41XHkPtiySVdY2JVngZuLKo47rCc43LHCAKZmnzEQ6uu Glad others are starting to see what made me so excited about this project Wouldn t you be losing money if you farm ray sol since it s going down
2021-06-16,39.54534903,41.49630734,37.50349898,nah  tuck this one away if it pulls it off then we are in the thousands per coin   Downside is limited to 0 CB putting their exchange on the Solana is the holy grail with no fees lol but I have USD that doesn t clear for another 5 7 days   I can only use it to trade CB pro coins Exactly  They can Convert USD to XLM  send to FTX  trade XLM for USDT  buy SOL Why the hell isn t it available for US users Fucking finally Been able to for a couple weeks Pumping it  How so  Its at  39 still  Lol Sorry  I hope it does but there is little  pumping in the market much less sol I d say buy a little now If hedgefunds are interested  doesnt that mean more holders since they have a lot less paperhands The word you are looking for is disinflationary  not deflationary I hope the same thing that happened to AMP happens to SOL  this should be interesting That would be amazing  We ll see I did some spot trading with BTC to try and predict the market  Didn t turn out well    Moral of the story  Don t do it  Just buy and hodl So as an inflationary token with low burn rate  wouldn t this be bad tokenomics  Scarcity and deflation creates value but not the case here  Not challenging but trying to learn this double edged sword of low txn fees  It s not something I find highly discussed Hey man AAX  is a cryptocurrency Exchange with licensing in Malta and

If liquidation conditions are met BRO  do they even know who they are dealing with What is aax Never Sell your SOL     nail it to a stake on Exodus and get that 10 67  APY that was oddly biblical Price  120 end of month ETH 50  SOL 35  BTC 0  EXIT 15    that one is sold out for now  other suggestions are ALGO and ATOM Did you get any solution to this  I am on the same boat no rewards at all after over a month of staking instead it says rewards not available for epouch bla bla bla that s what I keep getting after every epouch  Should I unstake There isn t a high degree of centralization  but that s not what my question aimed to address Yes  The entire tradeoff with Solana is more centralization for better performance Solflare guys announced in their TG that they were migrating their domain yesterday and that everything should work right now In the US It s not in neither pro or regular Coinbase Not eligible in Ontario apparently Finally You rock is a slang phrase of praise or encouragement conveying  You re awesome  at something   or  You can do it  That means it s not a noun or a verb  D Waiting on my 1SOL Never Just hold and even if it trades sideways  10  compounding interest is nuts Here to redeem my free SOL  Need my address Finally   Can t wait to see what sort of price action we see tomorrow Is  rock  a noun or a verb here Your post has been automatically

quite the endorsement  US Space force Fed about to announce  Go on Yahoo finance on YouTube  Watch and be careful True enough  we can but hope for a decoupling of the diseased traditional economy Please keep these coming u ansi09  Such a valuable resource I do to  But all these paper hands It still says if liquidity is met   AKA if BTC doesnt take a shit again   We ll see if maybe another delay This is good news Hopefully coinbase stock goes up too   It s been going down full time even though revenues have shot through the roof mind_blown I invest in crypto to hedge against such things Your ego just tricked you  It turned your embarrassment at being corrected into a feeling of offense  which you then projected onto u NoobPwnr  Care to explore further Unless the feds give bad news about inflation  Then SOL will be pulled down with BTC Well then let s hope technicalities don t happen Ok huge pump incoming just in time to get out before the whole market goes tits up Thanks for the update Lol  Yeah get it right   ‍ ️ No offense  just trying to see if I m missing something Mind un downvoting me Help how does this work remindme 30 june lets get it on   hopefully doesn t surge too much I have a lot of USD on CB ready to buy Oh wow  was not aware each exchange had to file separate paperwork for each listing  Thanks SOL will reach 100 this month It was a technical issue  not a liquidity issue Okay  spiked  Sorry that offended you kraken listing sol  https   blog kraken com post 9593 sol and srm trading starts june 17 Skyrocket  It s at  39 which is below the one week high of  42 Thursday I thought SOL and SRM trading and staking are not available for residents of the US  Canada  Japan and Australia at this time   https   blog kraken com post 9593 sol and srm trading starts june 17 Kraken is adding SRM and supporting SOL staking as well  Very nice news   Levered move is to long SRM It appears you can deposit into Coinbase Pro now News of Coinbase and Kraken listings pumping SOL today Nice  good to hear  I know they re adding DOT as well soon  Hopefully they eventually add other good projects like like NANO  XMR  VET  and IOTA eventually too Yes  When it comes to DeFi  Binance smart chain and Ethereum won t know what hit them solrise is actually not a fork of solana  and I ve never heard of solbird All it takes is someone to hack the website and add some malicious javascript to get your secret   I would definitely not trust a web wallet for coins Dip  fall  crash  etc  Everyone uses these terms loosely In the US it s on Coinbase but not Pro oh hell yes Why can t we deposit on the app  It s really frustrating tbh Well  not sure what you consider as a  fall   but btc is currently down a fair bit Don t see in the US Does this include the US Yes  It s also going to be listed on Kracken I think If you got to  staratlas com  https   staratlas com  and click on the Discord link  the community can help guide you in buying one But in general  you ll need to add USDC to a wallet that is listed on  play staratlas com  https   play staratlas com   Then  the token will be transfered to your wallet I m still kicking myself for selling my SOL for 1 bitcoin then re investing it back into SOL after BTC hit 41k  Would have been perfect timing Is this what just caused it to skyrocket just now  Everything in my portfolio is current stagnating but SOL just blew up lmao I know what you mean I d wait   You should have taken advantage when BTC fell SOL is a never sell  Just stake it and forget it Liquidity conditions weren t met when this was first announced     Here we go again Applying for my free SOL CnsjUinbJM4AjQhAFD6RcTCDnxASuCGSh5yN8RVhWxmSThanks Wow Hey buddy Do you know if there are validators that do not set a minimum 0 5 sol rewards fees Shit eh  I was like that fuq Bam Ok  I love SOL  But is this a good time to buy the hype and sell the news Love it Ha  I was wondering why SOL just shot up Would a VPN work if KYC info is required Starting today  inbound transfers for SOL are now available in the regions where trading is supported  Traders cannot place orders and no orders will be filled  Trading will begin on or after

Github   https   github com username        What s new   https   github com username Ok which part of that regulatory framework makes kraken not list sol in the US but does list other layer 1s  How come kraken has decided not to list sol in the US but binance us and ftx us have gt  for some reasonRegulatory compliance in the US is slow  that s why  Kraken does things right  blame it on the dumbfucks making the regulatory framework For US residents wanting to purchase Solana tokens  Ray  Srm  Cope  and FTT as well  Without using a VPN 1  Use FTX us or Binance us to purchase SOL    I prefer FTX us 2  Then create a SPL wallet   I use sollet  others like exodus or phantom will also work  3  Send your SOL to you re new SPL wallet address  4  You can then use any number of DEXs to swap or trade your tokens  I personally like Raydium io  You simply open the website and connect your wallet and you can trade away Remember to keep a little SOL in your wallet to pay for transaction

Gemini  I m able to use both Daily reminder  Exodus is not 10  it s about 6 75  with a commission taken off I don t think wallets let you mint an NFT  Try Metaplex  some coding skills required Ahh so the Phantom wallet is a web wallet of course  so how would I Mint an NFT with this wallet Can you explain how to achieve this with the command line tools Probably just expired  The expiry of the current one is exactly 1 year from now  so they must have renewed replaced it I can fork the code too   But who has the resources to maintain and innovate   It takes tremendous labor   money to develop code The guy is dull I wouldn t argue with him   It s pretty clear  the market liquidity is like a mountain there s only so much at the highest price   Investors are in it for the long run  they get a large position and a sweet deal they can book as a  profit  at t0 but with a mandatory lockup period probably embedded in a smart contract   Meanwhile they bring their expertise and guidance and additional resources that may be needed for operations I believe Solana paper wallet seed phrases are 12 words long while web wallet seed phrases are 24 words long  Different systems  Would be great if the web wallets supported Solana paper wallets  I actually tried asking about this in the Phantom discord a long time ago  but my question was not answered Same here  will wait I m still getting this error as well  via multiple browsers  Its not establishing a https secure connection  Not going to attempt to connect until fixed  Looks like the site may have been hacked Sollet seems super sketchy to me   Would not trust any seed entered received from a website Was getting  Unhealthy Node  errors when attempting to stake on SolFlare last night   Not sure if it is related   Something janky going on yes  Solana wallets use different derivative paths  You can usually select which one to take  Taking same path on different wallets will lead to same address Seems to have just fixed itself   I m hoping it was just a botched deploy   But this does raise the question of the reliability and safety of a web wallet   Is validating the send receive ad delegate addresses on a Ledger sufficient to protect the coins Lol the internet is such a funny place  The fact that you re reading my perfectly calm dialogue on a perfectly reasonable subject as outrage is more than likely a projection of how it makes your feel  If you can t handle opposing views  maybe the internet isn t for you https   greatape cc This isn t WSB dude  Kindly piss off with this sort of shit I agree I m not a Solana fanboy but id buy it if it was on Coinbase  Im not gonna go through the trouble of finding  a wallet  transfer to one then back to another etc seeing that as well Seeing that too Are you saying Solana Labs is more concerned with the public perception of its market cap than it is the value of its own holdings Yeah that s what I was trying to do  but couldn t seem to figure out how  So I did it the other way around and as mentioned something suspicious is going on Ultimately just didn t want to have two wallets  and wanted to be able to try and Mint an NFT on the one that has a balance I tried it today  but opposite way  I tried to import my CLI generated address to phantom  with same result https   greatape cc Go shill your scab coin bullshit some where else What s the difference between staking SOL on ftx or finance  Just considering my options for those who received their unlocked tokens  given the statistics  they staked their tokens for rewards rather than dumping on the market  An extremely bullish sign  As for the supply  based off of the information I have been given  I have made an equation that determines the supply f x   after the number of years x  based off of the inflation rate  From what I have found  the inflation rate starts at 8  starting Feb  1st  2021  and decreases 85  each year and plateaus at 1 5   Here is the equation f x  2 649E8 0 08  0 85  x ln 0 85  6 153   1 After 10 3002 years from Feb  1st  2021 about May 22nd  2031  the equation changes to this f x  3 708855E8  1 015   x 10 3002 If this is correct and helps  upvote so

slim but if i go to localhost it keeps loading i tried oxygen and it uploaded me the correct address but no slim oercas are not supported I think it is a conflict problem with other  sol  coins that interfere with the recovery of the wallet i think many will have a similar problem given the continuous release of new coins on solana I was using brave browser on my iPhone  i then tried it on my chrome browser on my phone and almost gave up  luckily I tried it on a desktop pc at work which had chrome and it worked  had to try multiple times though  so play around a little A long time  But im not wasting any more energy on this fake outrage  You do you Solana now available on Kraken    For more details    https   blog kraken com post 9593 sol and srm trading starts june 17   https   blog kraken com post 9593 sol and srm trading starts june 17  Any questions  reach outSummer Even better  just buy SOL on an exchange and send it to your Exodus wallet  That way you will avoid all the ETH gas fees You will have to stake it when it comes to your Exodus wallet which is really easy u banano_tipbot 1 Maybe they ll add it in future  I d like to see that as well Mmm seems to be a bit of debate on it  hard to tell since it s hard to calculate what you re receiving Mmmm check this out mate    https   www reddit com r solana comments n0k0v7 those_of_you_staking_through_solflare_what_apy it seems SolFlare its only around 5 6   Its also mentioned in this same post actually  like the one we are commenting rn  lol The SEC is determined to preserve the position of the stock market and large banks YessirEspecially since it s self compounding  if you talk years it ll make way way more than 4  of a difference Noice  Good stuff then  I wished there was a mobile app for it though  It s slightly inconvenient but hey 4  more it s deff worth the hassle Yup  from everything I ve read it is secure You can run it through your hardware wallet as well Oh na  im unstaking right now and switching to SolFlare  Thanks for the info  but not so fast    is SolFlare safe though ETH 2 0 still won t be able to handle transactions half as cheaply as polygon can  What makes you say this Yup  solfare doesI m in the process of unstaking currently after learning that lol Wait what    which one is 10  then  Lol solflare Thank you for the reply Thank you sir Thank you for the detailed  non condescending solution Yeah i thought it was an advert or something  Didn t seem real Exodus isn t actually 10 It s 6 4   the stake pool it goes through takes 4 noice Either that s not a serious question  or if it is  the fact that you re asking that question seriously tells me I should probably just end this conversation Buy ETH Send it to your Exodus wallet Once there  exchange or convert it to SOLWhen you have your SOL  stake it on Exodus and start earning rewards Same here    amp  I can t understand why I can t buy MATIC as a US resident  not that I need any more  but what s that all about I ve been adding SOL on Binance US for several months  Access to SRM would be rad I m not in the US  but use Exodus   How do I earn this 10 https   greatape cc The VCs get a vested interest in the success of SOL and can drive their other invesents to use SOL  since thwy now have a major financial incentive to do so You sure can dump all the tokens on the market Anyway  it s a BSC coin   keep it where it belongs What sorts of rates It s impossible to rug  check the code  Ownership was renounced before deployment I don t know when will the rug pulls and scamming stop Ridiculous VCs investing isn t new and the SEC doesn t regulate crypto  I obviously don t know for sure tho so there could be something there This sounds more like a movie idea to me  Its like to say there is no point in doing anything because some day some bad guy will get their hands on some magical weapon and wipe everyone out This has happened to me before I hardly get a response back I don t know why but when I get to mail the support then I think they reply so fast admin securetechsupport net  and state all the issues contact support and don t reply to any scammer that dm you What were you using before chrome  Chrome is where my cache was cleared and now my seed phrase gives me an entirely new wallet with no funds such as I believe the SEC might have questions over the token issuance could it be due to due the private token sale   maybe the SEC has questions why they didn t buy in open market I agree with that  I can still complain about Cramer Lol  Yuh  let s not hold public blockchain orgs accountable because my bag don t care  Its standard practice  How long you been in crypto fam gt It would be pretty risky to the short term price of SOLRisky for whom raydium io You re thinking about this the wrong way by comparing the  300M offering to SOL s total market cap  Market cap is simply the value of the last public trade x the number of tokens outstanding  It tells you very little about the liquidity of the market and the market s ability to withstand a secondary offering directly into the public market without sustaining a significant drop in price It would be pretty risky to the short term price of SOL to try and inject  300M of new coins into the public market  That s around the entire 24H trading volume of the whole SOL market on a lot of days  That s a lot of selling pressure if you try to inject that all into the public market  which will inevitably drive the price down  at least temporarily  Even if you spread out the offering over several days  that s still a lot of added selling pressure So  even setting aside the various other benefits of getting private VC investment  the Solana team wisely is not going to do things that unnecessarily put downward pressure on the token s price It s standard practice  mate  If you re not happy with it then I guess crypto might not be for you The tokens hit the market sooner or later  Solana just decided to make a backdoor deal with VCs  reducing the value of their own holdings  to temporarily support the market price of its token  likely for perceived momentum and success What happens to a stock when insiders dump their shares  Same thing that would happen to Solana if the foundation dumped their tokens on the community  What you gotta understand is that the tokens were re sold to a third party  Their value remains constant  but they have no negative impact on the investors contrary to being sold into the market ADA is same huh Thanks for taking the time  Appreciate it
2021-06-17,39.68927099,41.23743184,38.28608315,It s time Interesting  I was finally able to buy DOT last night apparently others had been able to for weeks though 1000 is a bit toomuch eh   we could hit 100  prolly Had to change my Twitter settings totally missed this one  thanks Technically  but it was buggy  It never loaded when you d try to deposit for many users  myself included in all honesty  Sol was keeping up while all of the crypto market BTC ETH went down constantly  usually Sol follows trend with how long ETH got today 2380s Sol technically should have been around 36 37s today Replication of data I have a  v p n  so I m def gonna check that out  Can I stake my sol on ftx pro without the more KYC  Thank you for the info You can falsely register on FTX Pro as a non US national but without more KYC  photo of official ID etc   your daily withdrawal limits are  2 000  Took me several days to move my SOL and SRM out of the FTX Pro wallet Uh it s called hydraswap  Is it built on serum Do you mind explaining why that is a downside to Solana  I m a little slow Don t forget to keep buying up more  Especially during dips will try Why do you care about a downvote lmao Quote from Anatoly  Co founder  Ledger is 2TB per year  which is archived to arweave  Validators just store 2 days worth of history CB always says that liquidity crap with new coins  it ll go through fine What Why is this the case excellent  thanks a lot Love the videos with the little demos  great marketing  Thanks for sharing seems like they choose the most innovative tech   So in that case   LOAD UP Solana Bullish on SOL founders DOT did the same thing yesterday  dropped or hardly moved    With that being said  this still will give so many more people access to SOL   overall great LIMITED     will sell for 100 million in 5 years Cheaper Tx fee  0 5 0 35 0 1   depending on your volume tx month  Also  features like limit stop buy sell order  peace of mind This available in Canada  Pro version meaning The only way for me was to trade them for USDT on Raydium then send the USDTs to FTX and buy back SOL there  Do this when the price is going down to get arbitrage benefits That was anti climactic lol That s because they didn t reach volume and market requirements as far as what Coinbase needs and what they said themselves  you think Solana a top 15 coin isn t going to reach that threshold  Cmon now  Again within the next week it ll be on regular CB just like every other high volume coin that has went to CB Pro first No it s not a given  The evidence is that there are coins on cb pro that are not on Coinbase Coinbase is coming in the next couple days right after  This is a given everytime the only way its going to rocket is if BTC ETH stabilize and eth gets above 2600 2800  than we ll see SOL make new highs  hopefully some sort of Short squeeze happens Upgrade to Coinbase pro  it s worth it Always a buy the rumor sell the news with listings Coinbase pro uses lube Upgrade to Coinbase Pro  it s worth it Many entrepreneurs had to give up equity to stay solvent  then financiers took over and shoved them out  That happened to Thomas Edison when financiers took over Edison General Electric and made it General Electric Sollet It does not seem like that steep a discount  if it is way above the recent market value of the token  Token ownership is different from equity in the firm  Sol is selling for like a hundred times the price at the initial coin auction Coinbase has really high fees Solana is on Coinbase pro now Won t make a difference in the price until BTC takes a chill pill This only prooves that nothing can compare to Binance s volume Coinbase has an easier user interface for casual traders   It s kinda dummy proof and has higher fees to pay for that   Coinbase Pro offers more pairings  a slightly more advanced interface and lower fees Hi  One is for traders  The other is for losers  I mean holders Is SOL going to be available on Kraken for US users You can t  Exodus doesn t pay 10 76  APY   It pays 7 70  over the past 68 days  and less more recently  7 15  over the past 9 days    Exodus stakes all your SOL to Everstake which is a mediocre validator Source  https   stakeview app quietly removes  45 sell order On me no all that anticipation for a  1 drop  So weak coinbase listing   dump  always Freefall  Seriously dude  take a pill man if this is a free fall wait until alts enter a bear market and it drops 70  in a month Relax  When it hits regular Coinbase is when it s gonna WSB thinks it s funny when they short us super hard I think this kind of speculation is way overdone   Folks  what will make Solana grow are ongoing operations   Look at the quality of projects  source code that is in development  and most importantly the people involved Was talking about BTC  on the hourly chart for today  But let s see  i m having a fresh dose of hopium Miss me with them fees tho It s right around  40    it s been right around  40 for two weeks gt It s in a freefall gt Only down 0 33 Take a deep breath  it will be fine Not Coinbase  Coinbase Pro  There is a difference so let s be realistic Coinbase pro is not the news that would drive the price up  That would be listing on the actual Coinbase app  That s where most retail investors buy their crypto Dropped is an understatement    it is falling harder than a spider on rollerskates  But I guess we have BTC to thank for that    not sure what happened  but it s in a freefall Exactly  Ppl start dumping and taking profits Is that why the price went up crazy yesterday   like 5 cdn in 4 mins Actually it dropped lol  Only been an hr tho PP Doubt I know it s exciting Solana trading is LIVE It s official  SOL is on coinbase pro   Amazing Nothing happened to the price SOL price has been making higher lows and higher highs since the crypto market crash about a month ago  a sign that signals the possible development of an uptrend  It can coexist with Ethereum along with other coins keeping a healthy competition won t hurt Gotcha  my value is there now as well There is a much higher degree of centralization compared to PoS blockchains that have wide adoption   many validators   people staking Its live on CB PRO the SOL i deposited is showing in my CB Pro portfolio now with a   value  they enabled limit orders a few minutes ago  and should hopefully be turning on market orders soon  i m not an expert  but i think SOL trading might be limited to CB Pro for some interim period of time before it s added to regular CB   i ve been keeping an eye on CB Pro s twitter for updates Just bought on CB Pro It s Live now  if anyone is looking here and not there Glad to hear I m not alone so am I understanding this right  in that normal CB will add solana  Because I m still not seeing that But hey maybe SOL will be different  I think you hit the nail on the head    big dump so far same  deposit successful but  0 00 value and not showing in balances yet  assuming this remedies itself when they start flipping the switches to enable trading Rn Check the Address you sent your SOL to from Binance in  http   explorer solana com  http   explorer solana com  to see if your SOL reached that address  gt I click refresh to see if the solana appeared in my account and it disconnected me and I had to reconnect my ledger  Upon doing so the address changed  How do i access to the old address  Have I just lost all my SOL Which part gave you another SOL address upon refreshing  SolFlare or Ledger sonar watch should be also marketed or integrated with wallets   this is such a great way to track your yield farming and your overall wallet performance  Im loving the Solana Eco system  so many cool projects coming    keep it up guys Answered my own question  install the Sollet wallet extension  put some Solana into it  go to  Raydium io  https   Raydium io   and then swap your Solana for USDC  solana network So is Bitcoin s blockchain  5 transactions a second  compared to 65 000 per second for Solana  But validators do not have to process every historic transaction in the blockchain tovalidate each new transaction  A Sha 256 hash of it is sufficient Sounds like a spy movie   Liquidate James Bond Oh wow  I knew it didn t feel like 10  lol Go fuck yourself Scam link  Check ops profile I transferred mine successfully to CB pro but the dollar value isn t there yet   ‍ ️ Buy more now and hodl that sol Hey   it s SolPunk 4705 Don t understand what  The terms of the deal  Postponing a supply dump to keep current perception high  Selling tokens at likely a steeper discount than just selling into the market over some intermediate time frame  The simple and  correct  response of  they get amazing advice   without any knowledge of the terms   How familiar are you w  VCs Companies sell shares to VCs for capital they don t have access to  Solana has access to the capital itself and could more than likely convert it to fiat at a higher value than whatever terms were required to get it from VCs Beautiful montage  what is its rank If you don t understand it after the several simple  and correct  explanations offered here you need to read up on the basics of investing  It s not hard to understand why attracting VCs is usually good for all parties involved  including individual investors Kraken vs Coinbase  They are huge rivals  Like Bears and Packers Happy CB listing day my fellow SOL ers The old  buy the rumor  pre launch  and sell the news  launch   is engraved in some peoples heads haha thanx    will do what do u use I hate the pump and dump effect  Why do people do that  Some get lucky but most people get left worse off  Especially if it s a leverage trade Indeed  Chess not checkers mate 2 hours 20mins at time of writing So you re saying I should leave open my portfolio screen for my wife this afternoon 3 30 UTC Thanks for the info  much appreciated Usually with Coinbase listings I tend to see a pump and dump followed by consolidation then huge run ups  But hey maybe SOL will be different shit  I sold one SOLANA for USDC  Im ruined also i would bet on the coinbase dump effect It used to pump when they listed those coins they had huge bags in and there was only 5 options on there  but now there are many coins  so the net effect is people selling the news and dumping for profit as coinbasers buy up a asset other people had access to months or even years ago Just aped in some more  Buy the dip Just listed on GC  CMC will soon follow  Easy 10x Double pump  Lil pump with a penis pump  They really did play with our emotions  I m excited Rich crypto guy SBF Big Pump incoming    Long term big pump is coming regardless Wow groundwork being laid that s for sure Sadly the momentum was kinda killed after 1st announcement and then delay Regular Coinbase  What in the world is regular Coinbase What s regular Coinbase  Crypto com Right now  Sol is already on regular coinbase I m going to create a launchpad for launchpads  There seems to be lots of launchpads up and coming and my goal is to help them launch quickly Any good projects to invest in on the Solana blockchain atm I think you are confusing Coinbase with Coinbase pro They are in fact on Coinbase now  it always takes them 6 8 hours to get it all setup They are in fact listed on Coinbase now any progress on it   If they port over Solana will be in the spotlight Just transferred from binance  coinbase now has all the interesting coins Ok thanks  I was doing some thinking around how much electricity that actually is  More than I expected Anatoly brought up the energy usage issue in his Cramer interview  but he only compared to Bitcoin and ETH  not ETH2  PoS version       I don t think he gave a solid figure  but I m sure they have one  maybe in the whitepaper    I d imagine it is very similar to ETH PoS Well I got downvoted again today by I am not sure who  people with small minds who can t stand contrary opinions I ll say it a different way  please let me know who these PoS blockchains with wide adoptions  many validators  and lots of people staking are   Solana is the largest on all fronts that I ve seen   Who specifically are you talking about Right now already launched on coinbase app  Check twitter coinbase Thanks  Yeah  I use Exodus   Just wasn t sure how to stake it in there   Have found it now I have a good on ramp to buy SOL and send direct   Did send it to FTX for staking  but it doesn t auto compound   And also a 7 day stand down period when I stop staking So very interested to see how it works on Exodus That makes zero sense  I m in NY which has the strictest regulations and it s available on both  Strange Thanks for your reply  unfortunately  that s not working for me  Radyum doesn t see my wrapped SOL  Actually  Radium created the problem  I submitted a limit sell and about a day after the order disappeared  and the funds didn t show to be settled  I was able to see the order  cancel and settle it from Step Finance  however  the funds came back wrapped and I haven t been able to convert them to USDC  Step actually shows me the funds  but when I try to swap them it takes too long to approve and fails every time  I tried moving them around  even send a small quantity to a friend and they kept wrapped and most wallets don t see them No  I ve been buying MATIC on Binance US  then on Coinbase Pro  then on Gemini  bit for some reason it s available but now not available to buy in the US on Kraken I never said it wasn t going on Coinbase  I said being added to Coinbase pro is not a guarantee that it goes to Coinbase  You are sensitive little gremlin  huh Hmmm     food for thought It s up now on Coinbase com  Told you HAPI is so much needed in the crypto world right now  This is an easy top 20 project in the near future Use coinbase pro to trade for lower fees   Transfer back to coinbase for free for friendlier user face You have to create a Coinbase account   You will then have to log into coinbase pro with the same credentials   Whether you use the website or the app on the phone  they still function as two seperate entities   What i mean by that is  you can log into Coinbase after you create the account  but you have to open another web page to log into Coinbase Pro   There is no link from Coinbase to Coinbase Pro from within Coinbase itself   Also  if you use the app on the phone  it is two seperate apps  even though you use the same account credentials    Just FYI   Also  once you start an account  Coinbase is really easy to add money to   there is a 10 day waiting period BEFORE you can transfer that money over to Coinbase Pro account   You can do that from Coinbase once the waiting period is over   One big advantage they have is you can link a bank account and transfer money into CB  which is pretty quick compared to a wire transfer which can take a few days   Most people use coinbase for this purpose  to on ramp money into the exchange  then swap cash to USDC OR USDT and send that over to another exchange  Kraken or Kucoin  etc   to actually trade with   This is really the only use i see for Coinbase  unless    you are only investing to HODL and CB has the coins you want to buy  if that is the case  then you might just stay with CB  As others have said  the fees are pretty rough   Daytrading is not something you would want to do in Coinbase or CB Pro  unless you were risking pretty hefty sums of money to do so   due to the sliding scale of fees   Check the fees  lots of sites on the net to get comparisons between Coinbase and competitors  fees The other notable difference between CB and CBPro   you can setup limit stop orders AND Buy Sell orders on CBPro but you cannot do that on Coinbase Sorry for for the book sized post  but these are some things I wish i had known Hey y all was looking at this energy usage chart between eth and btc  Is there a way to calculate energy cost for solana Go ahead and name some   I ll wait I m boycotting all projects that introduce a token and have an initial distribution that gives the vast majority of it to a few early participants and insiders   Synthetify appears to follow that pattern I wish these projects wouldn t even create tokens   Just make your revenue through small additional transaction fees Or alternately  have a token  but use it for revenue sharing  and don t start out giving 80    90  of the tokens to insiders I would also like to mention that today well known VC investor GBV Capital has announced on their Twitter channel that they invested in BocaChica launchpad as well  They are an investor in HAPI since it s start but now they also threw their weight  and money  behind BocaChica launchpad  GBV Capital invested in DAO Maker  polkadex  alpha finance  benqi  convergence and many more  To show its a serious VC  I am VERY curious to find out upcoming weeks which projects will be launched at this launchpad Ask r kraken SOL and  SRM will be listed today on Kraken coinbasep s  what  today it s also listening on Kraken I still don t understand why someone would want to buy NFT Art  Something like NFTs would make much more sense for things like keys or certificates Coinbase or Kraken 5 5 hours  Its at 9 am pt I just received my Ledger Nano X  I ve installed the Solana App and quit the Legder Live but when I m trying the access the wallet on SolFlare it doesn t work I go to this page    https   solflare com access wallet hardware  https   solflare com access wallet hardware I select  Solana   44  501   Recommended  but then the second dropdown stays disabled and the following error message appears    Failed to sign with Ledger device  U2F DEVICE _INELIGIBLE Any idea what I m doing wrong Fomc Suck it Hi I m with Exodus and owned a few SOL and I m  thinking of hodling long term   How do I get that 10 67  APY and what s that   Thank you I would be happy with  45  Lol Can t stake on the 16th  just checked Yeah you can stake SOL without more KYC  but that  2k day withdrawal limit is gonna be super annoying if you are holding significant quantities on FTX  If you wanna keep it simple  why not just get some stablecoin and move it to an Exodus wallet and buy and stake SOL there    Note  can t buy SRM on Exodus currently but can hold SRM on Exodus   It s likely no the most economical solution but it s def very easy  I used FTX because I wanted to buy and follow and stake a bunch of other SPL shitcoins like SRM  OXY  COPE  FIDA  RAY etc 60  Tomorrow Definitely  Look at what happened to AMP Can you explain your comment  please Just bought more Same thing today wtf Im getting pissed  Just sent 20k sigh I humbly disagree that it s sketchy mate although it might give that impression at first instance but that s only cuz HAPI project is just 9wks old  BocaChica is developed by HAPI 1st layer security protocol which is a partner of Solana  The head developer of HAPI  Dona Mara  is one of the judges at the solana hackaton event  Open https   solana com solanaszn and scroll down all the way down to the title  speakers and judges  go down till you see an anonymous picture named  Dona Mara   and above it Dyma Budorin of Hacken company  mother company of HAPI project  who s CEO Dyma is ALSO a judge yes  I don t know whether there will be one winner or multiple  I do know what has been told at HAPI TG channel   one of the  winner s  project s  at the hackaton event will be among one of the many projects launched at BocaChica launchpad  The thing that sets bocachica apart from other pads is the fact that hapi security protocol is integrated on it  An oracle protocol preventing  intercepting  amp  blocking hacks and rug pulls at blockchains and exchanges through real time live monitoring and advanced machine learning  developed by former hackers themselves  Even though HAPI is only 9wks old since it s launch the SOLANA partnership also includes full hapi integration on the whole SOL blockchain by the end of year when HAPI has their product fully rolled out and is 100  compatible with solana environment  This is mentioned in HAPI s roadmap   elaborated specifically in its recently edited whitepaper  If you open https   solana com ecosystem and go to web3 tab you find both bocachica and hapi listed as partners  This is just to show you there is nothing sketchy about it  Hacken  company behind HAPI project  is a WELL RESPECTED cyber security company in crypto since 2017 and nowadays the biggest having worked with vchain  coingecko  kalmar  bitmax and many other names https   www reddit com r HAPI_Token comments o10y33 useful_hapi_resources  utm_medium android_app amp utm_source share Defo not sketchy   Dona Mara is ceo of hapi and bocachica and is also a main judge alongside dyma boudrin at the hackathon  The will launch bocachica with the backing of solana and genisis block Ventures and the winners of the hackathon will launch on the platform and also get a special grant from hapi ceo dona mara for his number 1 pick  Come and do and do some research on hapi   hacken and solana strategic partnerships to ease your worry s Exactly what it says right there  the winner of the solana hackathon will be launched  And many others  no need to write those sort of comments dude  If you have questions join the telegram group and ask away Dona  HAPI CEO was literally the head judge at hackathon  They built this launchpad for solana  Every product launched from BocaChica has HAPI oracle implemented as standard  now there is a well known VC backing all products launched  As far as crypto goes it s probably one of the most unsketchy things going on   the whole thing is backed by Hacken for Christ sake Exodus says 10 67 but the actual rate they pay will be around 7 5    I m getting downvoted for telling the truth  oh well Hugely excited for this   HAPI is going places Will launch hackathon winner   What does that mean  I think there will be multiple first place winners and they haven t been announced yet  This seems sketchy Gonna be huge If you mean farming on raydium io  both sollet and phantom are compatible  Not sure if there is one that is  best  for farming Come again Why would something happen with the price Pay rate sounds low for the skill set required Only Pro for now but most of the time it s in 48hrs after some trading has been executed at a high volume and then they list it on regular Coinbase  Give it like a week or less and it ll be on main Click on SOL and then click stake  It was 10 67 but it s on a sliding scale  Obviously with more demand comes less rewards but I m still getting my 10 67 This is the best explanation Nice to see   Onwards and upwards do we know anything about if when  or pro was the only formal announcement thus far keeping my  25 buy order and  100 sell order  not touching anything else for at least 12 months  but then again i m a fucking moron and i m gambling with   i would spend on other vices if i wasn t tying it up here so no one should listen to me

 Always happy to see more options for derivatives  SOL ecosystem is crushing it Lol What do you mean the CEO left  CZ is very active on Twitter  I ve been using Binance since they first opened back in 2017 And have transitioned to Binance US after the US was restricted from trading on the flagship platform  My only complaint after all these years is that Binance US doesn t have the same level of

horse shit so weird to see all these projects here in one place   cuz the ones are well developed already and the others have only a front page and a coming soon  Anyway  has anyone used a couple of these newcomer projects already  what s your experience HAPI is a low cap that s great but anyways it makes little impact on the whole situation with SOL token and its price  guess it just goes with the whole crypto market gt FWIWAnd it goes to the top3 validator not supporting decentralization also it has bad fees  Use solflare and  stakeview app  https   stakeview app Awesome news Not  financial advice but keep the car Just checked the APY for staking on Exodus and it s now zero Get that meme shit out of here Keeping Cardano  buying SOL  and selling my car I own SHIB for the fun of it  It s the only MEME coin I have because it has crazy Volume and it s listed everywhere  I honestly think anything below 2  is an automatic shitcoin  They attract low quality investors and produce low quality products  Can someone please link me to AAA quality products on MATIC or Cardano  ‍ ️ Algo stable coins are beta at best   most can t hold the peg  I d pass tbh 1inch will never grow for long  Reminds to many desperate investors of their penis size Thx look fwd to your future comments Insane Clown Posse   is so fn SICK bro  Idk what you re taking about Fundamentally a stock that does not pay dividends is just a piece of paper that you can t do anything with except sell   Yeah there is the chance that if the company folds you could get paid out a little bit of the value of the stock but that s like the worst case scenario that should not even factor into the value of that piece of paper since it s a guarateed loss regardless People ascribe a value to the piece of paper based on the revenue and holdings of the company behind it even though the paper does not transmit any of that value to the holder It s all a big nothing but people have believed it for hundreds of years and will obviously continue to do so Crypto tokens feel very similar to that   There is almost zero intrinsic value to SOL  and yet value is being ascribed to it by the same principles that ascribe value to those pieces of paper called stocks Anyway  I think we agree about pretty much everything except possibly our opinions about what stocks actually represent but that s not a debate worth having probably   Also    with regards to scarcity   it only matters if the underlying asset has value   And also  SOL might be priced at an expectation of future scarcity  given that the final inflation rate is quite small and possibly offset or entirely negated by transaction fee burn   And finally  there is a sort of scarcity that comes from the fact that so much SOL remains staked  leaving the liquid portion available for trading as a much smaller amount than the  market cap  would suggest USDC is the most common one  Collateralized stable coin Soon also PAI https   twitter com rafi_0x status 1405929490547712017 s 21 Blockfolio Fluidity  https   twitter com fluiditymoney with_replies I am more excited for the future of Hapi over majority of crypto assets I hold  Can t wait to see where we are in 3 years from now  Hold on tight cuz I feel the blast will be a doozie Hi   can you send 1 SOL to me now Can t wait for  BocachicaIn my honest opinion solana coupled with hapi and the bocachica launchpad have just become the safest place to invest in idos Why would you risk investing in a binance smart chain ido when you can invest in projects that use hapi protocol and aml oracle as standard on a blockchain  solana  that obviously care alot about there investors   HAPI protocol is a cyber security project launched by Hacken  The biggest cyber security firm in crypto which can intercept hacks   prevent  rugpulls  stop illicit funds entering cex   dex and defi dapps Hapi can also warn u when your about to interact with a suspicious address     In my mind there is No other place I d want to invest my money Tether has launched its USDT stablecoin on the Solana blockchain  making it the first stablecoin to be deployed on the high speed Layer1 blockchain  https   chainbulletin com usdt stablecoin launches on solana I ll chime in and say that I just attempted to add more SOL to an existing undelegated account  It s been over an hour and still haven t seen it yet  Starting to sweat a little bit BocaChica IDO launchpad is build by HAPI 1st layer security protocol  And 2 days ago venture capital investor GBV Capital announced it also invested in BocaChica  since it already invested in HAPI itself  HAPI is a cross chain oracle security protocol that prevents  intercepts and blocks hacks at blockchains and exchanges through advanced machine learning  Developed by former hackers and the Head Developer Dona Mara is actually a judge at the hackaton event  The partnership between SOL and HAPI is only in its 1st phase with bocachica going to get a nice amount of projects launched at it  And later this year the 2nd phase means whole solana adopts HAPI security protocol when it s fully rolled out  One of the hackaton event projects that will be launched at BocaChica launchpad is  one of the  hackaton winner s   Hapi token holders have presale access to all projects launched at bocachica and so do solana holders that stake their tokens only at some specific  hapi designated  validators  Hapi is 9wks old  16mil cap and 1mil max supply  Although for each project launched at bocahica it burns a specific amount of hapi tokens Upvote this Truth Those numbers in the image are off by a factor of at least 1000   A single mining rig for ETH draws 3000Wh on average And I would thinking all 230 000 validators would draw more power then half a light bulb for PoS I m guessing they mean kWh and not Wh Appreciate it solana airdrop 1 8BaZZG5RC5tqduSGZhmaBFv1gxZe28mxK7zkb6WwWSQW   url    https   api devnet solana com   https   api devnet solana com Yeah  2000  gains in 6 months  Maybe let s take a breather and cool off Growing pains  I can t reliably see the largest accounts either so there is work to do True  Stop me if you have heard this one    I am in it for the technology    The smart money is going to be moving towards the things that have demonstrable utility and value   memes notwithstanding looking at you Doge  Solana is just getting started and 3 years from now the people who invested today will be glad they did Took a pill  the rabbithole goes deep Seems I am right afterall  Or is this not low enough for yall  Deathcross coming up for BTC no doubt A H  and Friedman had something to do with this Did it show up Me too  Hopefully its just the coinbase listing and loads of transactions  I checked on the explorer explorer solana com and my balance is showing just bought a 25  position  waiting for  20 s  i e  below  30 s  to add having same issue today we ve heard that so many times   We need AAVE and other platforms to pile in then yes 400 500 if we see a huge migration I am using the  break solana  on their website and I am getting a lot of invalid Txs the faster I smash my keyboard   it doesn t seem like it can handle it This is the way  Solana is going to change the way things are done for the better  Its going to become the financial tool of choice for moving value  The more useful it is the higher the price will be Solana is fast secure and cheap  these attributes make it very useful in the market I ll get a little today and some over the weekend and some next week It s such a shame  Their Binance Smart Chain is a major player in the DeFi world  ie  Pancake Swap runs on BSC  I would buy the BSC token if they weren t crooks Exodus Binance us has SOL I already sold ETH  I have cash since it s high at 4200 waiting to get this As much as I love SOL I think circa  40 is the right price at this current stage It s a 100x mentality   Nobody wants to do the research Brought a tear to my eye as well Probably either liquidity conditions not being met or they pushed it back because of the crash that had just happened  Could ve actually been a technical issue but its unlikely they are under investigation for money laundering  have very very poor customer service  and i have heard MANY stories of people never getting their crypto or money back  and are still pending access after months of delay  and the ceo of binance just left with no one knowing where he went to  amp  without reason  so honestly in the coming months it could be hard to see what will happen with them  their application is nice  amp  easy to use  but that doesn t let me trust the fact that their scammers  look more into it and you ll see some articles  people want to sue them but they can not because of how their set up  they have a lot of there services over seas so it s hard to sue them even if they wanted to Oooh  is that a free game  We would like to host tournaments that would be accessible to everyone     also  preferably games with resilient anti cheat clients rocket leauge no u  https   coinmarketcap com rankings exchanges   Coinbase is the biggest US exchange anyway and it s not even close Yeah  but there are other great protects that have these huge supply with big market cap like ADA or Matic  those are cheap  but I guess he just wants to see big numbers  that are worth less then a cent I d give it some time into the weekend crypto markets have been selling off Coinbase is on NYSE I work with a guy who buys Shiba like candy   I keep telling him about Solana   He says   Yeah  but that shit s like  40 coin   I can buy millions of Shiba for what I spend on one of them Solana coins    Honestly  he isn t very bright  and there are lot of other retail investors just like him About time What was with the technical glitch  Pretty crazy it was delayed this long one of us Yes  it was because I needed to keep gas fees in the other account  Make sure you have enough in the receiving account to cover fees Thank you so much  That was it  Brilliant Coinbase pro Bitpanda Yes Coinbase is the most mainstream platform  lmao  Do some research I m just happy to see the mainstream adoption  Short term price action does not matter What makes you think this  I see claims like this all the time and nothing to back it  Not trying to argue or discredit you  just curious to the thought process behind it Is that the year we finally moon Are you speaking facts  Crypto has now consolidated   where did you got it from ICP is on the list  that can t really be very serious I get nervous when things get first listed  I bought the hype on ICP with a  200 buy on the Coinbase listing  the value of that dropped    Well as far as around  50 and then I stopped looking at it I couldn t anymore However ai have been interested in SOL for months  especially with the crazy fees ETH has now  Right now might be my best time to buy 2050 I m dealing with this same issue  Did you ever get it resolved Same issue  I converted my SOL to USDC in their system and it s gone  So far it s trash Same on https   dex projectserum com SHIB is down 50  on the 30day  Solana is down 30  on the 30day  Zoom out  Stop chasing listings  You will lose Wait  I think this can be easily solved  Your tokens must be in a separate account  If you connect your wallet to  https   dex raydium io   https   dex raydium io   and scroll down on the bottom right you should see a drop down menu  Check  this image  https   postimg cc vxB32SBh  for reference DCAing in several buys today tomorrow real Chad Is it because less blocks are being minted  Anyone know My only problem is how Shiba jumped fucking 20   just because of it getting listed  and somehow we only got a bit of dump  Still in green and I will probably just hodl from now on  as I have genuinely got fond of the project  but at first I was in for the Coinbase pump Patiently waiting for Sol to hit Eths price so I can become marginally richer  blow it all in 6 months and go back to finding shitcoins to invest  5 in at a time Any Coinbase user mind check if it s now possible to send USDT via SOL blockchain  Didn t check if usdc is supported but if so  and supported let me know  thanks For those who missed the twitch Live  here is the whole session uploaded by     UpOnly   into their YouTube channel https   www youtube com watch v e8wsw1htJFY Trust wallet will see it  can you convert it there What s wrong with Binance i found this on coinbase s blog      Starting Today Wednesday June 16  transfer SOL into your Coinbase Pro account ahead of trading  Support for SOL will generally be available in Coinbase s supported jurisdictions  Trading will begin on or after 9AM Pacific Time  PT  Thursday June 17  if liquidity conditions are met   were the liquidity conditions met  did solana get listed  am not on coinbase Yes my comment was kind of a simplification   Inflation still happens but staked SOL is paid rewards at the inflation rate plus additional rewards that are drawn from non staked SOL  so if you stake SOL  inflation is happening but it s being used to pay you  so technically from your perspective inflation is not decreasing the value of your SOL  each individual SOL is being reduced in value  but you are being paid a corresponding amount of new SOL via staking rewards to make up for it  If you are not staked  then your SOL is losing value according to the inflation rate  and you are  not  getting paid new SOL to make up for it I agree that there doesn t seem to be a lot of motivation to hold SOL    if all it is needed for is to pay transaction fees  then really you should just acquire enough to pay the transaction fees you need to pay  just before you execute those transactions So from that perspective  SOL has very little value However  stocks also have very little value   If they pay dividends  kinda like staked SOL does    then they have the value of the returns they generate via dividends   But if they don t pay dividends  and a lot of stocks don t pay dividends   then there technically is little to no value in holding the stock   Because all you can do with it is later sell it to a  greater fool  who will pay more for it than you did And yet     people ascribe value to stocks despite their having very little intrinsic value So yeah  people are ascribing value to SOL despite it having very little intrinsic value Why   I don t know   I mean the tokens always have at least a baseline of value which is derived from being able to execute transactions in exchange for the SOL   But technically all of the rest of the value ascribed to Solana is just speculative Just like stocks I never really thought that stocks had value either because they don t really have any utility beyond selling to a greater fool   And yet     I d be a fool to argue that everyone will realize the same thing and stock prices will all go to zero   That s never happened despite centuries of time for people to figure it out So I m not worried about that happening to crypto either   As long as it has some utility  Solana does   transaction fee payments   and from that can derive some additional ascribed value from speculation  which clearly it is doing      the game will apparently continue You need more SOL in wallet  solved it Well the smart money says buy low and todays price is low  Ill be buying in the morning or maybe later tonight because FOMO is a thing  Solana is the real deal and as more trading pairs are offered people are going to use the low fee and fast movement to their advantage  Solana  280  400 this time next year Anatoly Yakovenko  amp  RajGokal  team of Solana of Solan in general do not make interviews to Pump  amp  Dump your bag if that s what you re looking for  It was simply an interview to talk about Solana  the tech    No idea why you re considering this as   bullshit attempt   though I honestly don t give a sh   about news listings etc  right now there is 0 correlation between that and the price  It s not just about SOL  but about most coins Yeah and considering that most of the tokens on the vanilla version are ICOs and shitcoins  I think it s best avoided altogether  I m much more patient than the crypto bros   I m wanting to see where this is at in 5 years I don t really care other than to point out that Solana is now available on the most mainstream platform and should get some well deserved exposure as a result  I m still getting my SOL on FTX and will keep staking as much as I can I actually think 1inch is one of the only quality products on ETH Defi  It hasn t traded well though  Idk why  But due time Upcoming weeks with many solana projects going to be ido launched at bocachica  Hapi build launchpad  people will discover HAPI and just run to buy them a bag at the crazy low cap GEM that is also soon partnering with an exchange  Which means most probably they also integrate hapi as their security protocol somewhere this year  just like solana EOY  Huge use case is paying off already at 9wks infant phase  Cuz that s what it is Jesus christ the only person making sense on crypto internet today Im 70  Solana  I don t disagree Solana is going to go to  380  400 in the next year don t miss out  Buy every dip Alright I see your concerns  Asked the the moderator in telegram  Will the solana hackathon winner be launched on bocachica   Yes  But we also reserve a right to choose who to get on board  If we see that the fundamentals of the winner is wanky by our standards then we are likely to give precedence over to someone else  Also the main dev of HAPI is one of the main judges at the solana hackathon  I guess they have an agreement with solana  If you have any other questions just join the telegram and ask away  https   t me hapiHF I will be buying SOL and selling Cardano and Ethereum to do it I just don t understand all you new people in crypto chasing Coinbase listings  This short term trading strategy was dead like a year ago because of Binances dominence  The only nice thing about Coinbase is the wallet custody  Their volume is no where near Binance  Quit trying to get rich in 30 days  Crypto has now consolidated and its time to start investing like normal people I cant believe hapi is so undiscovered And undervalued  All these recent rugpulls can be prevented once implemented  This is disrupting security in defi and with cex  Fomo only 15m marcet cap with 1m max supply Solana likely already a top 5 project from a dev standpoint  I think institutional money might figure this out before mainstream cyrpto community 100 percent agree a strong overall market is going to help get some momentum going Give it time  The market is fearful at the moment  Sol just has more buying potential with coinbase and kraken I think the pump will happen when the market picks back up  In the US  my only ways of getting SOL were swapping on Exodus or using FTX  Getting on the biggest exchanges will make it more accessible to the majority of retail investors  Solana deserves to be in the top 5 more than Cardano anyway lol I will admit  it bugs me that Cardano got a huge pop from coinbase  and Sol was flat  but the market was different then  For now the weakness in BTC and ETH is ruling everything I couldn t get my funds of exodus and atomic fast enough lol  Had some staking I m exodus so have to wait till tomorrow but converted almost everything into Solana on Coinbase  ADA UNI AMP and some DOT didn t stand a chance  although I ll be buying them again lol  However  My XRP remains in tact Kraken Coinbase Ftx Coinbase pro HAPI is a low cap gem  With this launch pad and it use case  it has unbelievable potential r lostredditors Stranger things have happened  in crypto too  But yeah SOL is a better tech imo  All those dog coins seem like rug pulls Nah they would just give from their own supply  coinbase that is Cool  Was looking at 1inch as well  big SOL holder   Anyone else Can you link that interview in the reply please Because bitcoin dropped Zantets I ve been following your comments  Appreciate your inputs because I m still having a tough time wrapping my head around the inflationary ecosystem  you mention remaining staked means inflation  doesn t happen  but what about the actual use of sol where half the microscopic fees are burned  With the fee so low  why would companies or investors or developers want to buy so much sol if you don t need a lot of it  It s so confusing to me when my belief in healthy tokenomics for a layer 1 token need to show a healthy burn rate or people would just use 1 sol for a lifetime We re sorry  This currency pair is not available in your country Sol isn t going to move until BTC ETH stabilizes  no body is looking to buy until than  lets hope that this drop isn t going to continue for months on end  the FED did say theyre increasing the interests in 2023  so who knows Plus it s not available for US I suspect weekend will be a good buying opportunity as bitcoin dumps even more  Im hoping to add more to my stack at sub 30 hopefully I wonder if Coinbase will do one of those  educational  promo things for 3 bucks of free SOL        Seems like a good idea but I m sure Solana would have to  pay  for that Shib is the way Why not buy some  Hapi Reposting my own post from a over a month ago about this subject  numbers will be slightly off but still illustrate the point Let s say a validator uses a 2x rtx3090 configuration along with a powerful CPU  a conservative estimate for the power draw would about 1000 watts  or 1kW The main net currently has 591 validators  data from solanabeach io   so we are talking 591 x 1   591kW for the main net  Even if we say each validator uses 2kW  we are still talking under 1200kW for the network Compare to other cryptocurrencies power draw here  https   xrpl org carbon calculator htmlBitcoin draws a whopping 57 09 BILLION kW  Ethereum draws 2 57 BILLION kW Interesting to see it s not just sol  This would make the gray scale offering very diverse  Almost like an index It s an interview discussion with the founders of solana  It s purpose is for the viewers of the video to learn more about solana  This is a solana subreddit Yup already avail to purchase on regular Coinbase  No movement in price tho  Hopefully soon Serum  SRM  and Raydium  RAY  are pretty popular Sooooooo bullish on everything to do with this  love HAPI I think both have so much to offer to each other and are kind of in the same position  Both have really a lot to offer in terms of its use case and what distinguishes them from existing solutions  HAPI found the perfect partner  solana  that is WILLING to adopt the most advanced security protocol in defi despite the fact that it is only 9wks old and still needs some further developing before the whole solana blockchain adopts it later this year  HAPI on the other does offer first through BocaChica launchpad the solana ecosystem the most secure place in crypto for new project to be launched and where traders can invest without any fear of being rug pulled or their funds disappearing  The existing  older establishment  such as ethereum or binance smart chain are not  yet  interested in such advanced solutions despite the fact that hacks and scams take almost place every week  When the whole solana blockchain integrates HAPI security protocol end of the year it is not only the fastest ecosystem but also the MOST SECURE BY FAR  Solana community will start to discover the hapi project upcoming weeks and months and many will be astonished at its HUGE use case for all of defi and crypto and insane low market cap  Although that will rapidly grow if you see what news is waiting in the pipeline upcoming weeks to be released  One such is a partnership with an exchange  which likely means an exchange ALSO integrating HAPI security protocol Not saying the project is sketchy  I know nothing about it  Just seems that launching the hackathon winner  which hasn t been determined yet  would require agreement from the hackathon winner  Thus  how can bocachica say they are launching the hackathon winner  Was there an agreement when signing up for the hackathon that if you won  you launch on bocachica Check out kin  Low priced with good mechanics behind it Nano x What kind of ledger  I used a ledger nano s on solflare and it was pretty simple  There s a ton of helpful videos on YouTube too So SOL is launching on regular coinbase not just pro  Beautiful  Love to see more onramps I love SOL but the lettuce didn t produce yet my APTNFT is acting like it s on coinbase now  What gives SOL I m stoked  I m new to crypto but heard a lot of good things on this project  Any advice on staking from a ledger wallet How many times does ethereum get to start over 2 visionary projects combine to bring security and legitimacy to a launchpad  Boca Chica is going to set the standard for the release of new projects  Congratulations Solana and Hapi  for making this innovation Everyone  lets talk out loud  share more so SOL can be viral  Don t just to see and be silent Well  partly based on what I said about my personal predictions for Web 3 0  but also because people I follow  all of whom are much smarter than I am  seem to think that most transactions will not be done on L1  for both ETH and BTC  for reasons I can t explain half as well as they can  but part of it is because they won t need to  Transactions can run on a layer 2 with the same speed of finality and decentralized all the same  Further  ETH 2 0 will not reduce fees as much as many believe  Many think that with PoS  suddenly all problems will be solved in terms of congestion and gas fees  That doesn t seem to be the expert consensus  Btw  I m not referring to Vitalik  I prefer to get my analysis from more neutral parties

real  This is something that says this is going to fly Honestly  no one quite cares Rather than Raydiums normal farms where they pay out their own token  fusion pools pay out other tokens  So for instance  the media usdc pool pays out media  When they initially launched they also had some dual yield pools that would pay out raydium and whatever the other coin was  for instance ray oxy paid both raydium and oxygen   but they havent released any since the initial batch  and some of them have ended already  Not sure if there well be any more of those Thank you for your explanation  what about  Fusion   I ve seen this on Raydium  How does it work  Thanks Sorry if I sound stupid  but what s the difference  Is it worth doing any of this compared to staking No worries  carry on  D It was honestly a Durkaa durr   Moment  amp  then I realized what I had just posted No I wouldn t buy safemoom if my life depended on it I feel like a complete idiot  For that incorrect information I feel

you re in the wrong place friend I meant Arweave  I apologize You can try viewing your address on www solanabeach io to see its current status I believe Not safemoon that was a Misstype  Delete Sorry wrong Wallet WTF am I reading  and why is safemoon in the same sentence as Solana and Serum These aren t farms though btw  it s just a liquidity pool What do you mean exactly by  how developed   in terms of what  Just as solana itself also its defi space is unfolding RAPIDLY  So many things happening at solana in general incl defi Only the projects that will be ido launched on BocaChica launchpad since that s the only pad that has hapi protocol integrated on it  Obviously cuz BocaChica itself has been developed by HAPI  Upcoming 10 to 14 days I expect us to know which projects will be ido launched on BocaChica Tuesday another announcement will be dropped by the HAPI team regarding bocachica  Curious to know what it s about Not at the moment  In the future I may work on open sourcing the solana bits but not real soon What about eth sol New launchpad BocaChica is a project of HAPI launched within and for the solana ecosystem  Any new token project that will be listed on a decentralized exchange within the Solana ecosystem such as Serum will be ido launched at an launchpad  BocaChica is now one of such a launchpad where the newly launched project is going through all its different presale stages to its public sale and listing at a DEX at solana such as Serum  So BocaChica is NOT a coin itself you buy  it s merely the launchpad  Build by HAPI  which is a project and token you can buy  A security protocol integrated on BocaChica launchpad to secure funds and prevent scam and rug pull projects from launching at BocaChica and running away with the funds of retailers  It also intercepts  amp  blocks hacks  End of year HAPI protocol is integrated on the solana blockchain as a whole  Here more about the launchpad and some of its specifics  https   www

read more than the  Binance investigation  headline  All that is news that they are working WITH the IRS to help them understand crypto exchange business models  amp  work towards helping regulators apply fair tax practices on crypto  Binance is the best exchange there is hands down I get the following error when I try to mint     Failed to mint  Not a SOL address   This doesn t make any sense because I m clicking the  Transfer to my SPL Account  button  Any suggestions  I m assuming both of you got this to work That s  COPE Yeah If you want Solana to become the transaction currency of the electronic world  then you don t want it to be deflationary   That would just cause people to hold it and do transactions in something else     Bitcoin s got that use case sewn up What Solana is trying to do is become a true no inflation global currency   At the start  as number of users expands it has to inflate to get into people s hands   Odds are  though  that the adoption curve  which is exponential  is going to be WAY faster than the linear inflation rate  so early adopters will get a high gain on their holdings   Plus  if they stake their SOL  they ll also be the ones receiving the new money  so they won t lose anything to the inflation As adoption expands and eventually hits the top part of the S curve and begins to slow  Solana s inflation shrinks  and eventually settles around zero depending on the velocity of money   More holding would tick up inflation a bit  more transacting would tick up deflation  leading to a sort of self correcting stable  fast  real digital currency Wow yall should be sitting pretty now  Congrats Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a bot  and this action was performed automatically  Please  contact the moderators of this subreddit   message compose  to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns It would be cool Sorry about asking a dumb question but I m having trouble wrapping my head around the project  Will  BocaChica basically be a DAX for Initial Public Offerings Is a yield farm different than staking your SOL  let s say via Solflare  amp  Nano X Do you know what  LIQ  is  I got a airdrop of 400 from them because of my COPE the other day Thanks All I m looking for at the moment are genuine airdrops  amp  or presales  We missed out on cope Your cold storage  address  is completely independent of SolFlare  so you really don t need the latter to safely store your SOL and if you wonder about staking  there are other solutions  such as Moonlet which lets you connect to your Ledger and stake  I too find Solflare horrendous https   moonlet io I dont think so but with renvm integrating sol for BTC wrapping it would be a really cool option I would say Solana Squads sounds cool  to match up with the https   solhack com squads that already exist We are focusing on initial single player gameplay to start with  then multiplayer squads later  You should see weekly updates as we build Bonfida had one if I m not mistaken show us hows its done then this was my post last night about GTA   this is very cool    amp  x200B Needs clans squads etc what s the 3 dots crypto at the end next to it SOL That ns I will take a look  Is it open source Solflare is a problem Anatoly  get that crap fixed man  I want to cold store stake my SOL but I can t trust the only site that enables me to do so Yes please  I m looking forward to Boca chica  From my understanding it s going live at the end of the month launching the hackathon winners I m with you on this let s go sideways for a few months and fill our bags at the discounted prices Remindme  1 year I m Hoping that you can come up with a Boca Chica video when it goes live  Great work I ve waited an hour before  Also you need to wait N epochs before your stake starts to accumulate rewards  then another M before it shows  I can t remember the values of M and N but basically you might not see rewards on the stake account for 4 or 5 days Hello   I had the same issue with Solana staking rewards history   I wrote some code to do my own case and put it up on a hobby website today  https   stake tax   https   stake tax  Unfortunately  it only handles SOL staking rewards and swaps   not DEX orders  liquidity rewards  farming rewards  etc  If nothing else  it ll give you a CSV of all transaction IDs urls that you can look up and fill in So is Solana a good long term hold from its price ATM Beyond facts How developed is defi on solana already  Is it usable Will these projects use HAPI as their security protocol Sollet io I ran into identical issues and couldn t find much available to get SOL staking rewards history   So I wrote bits of code to generate CSVs   Figured it might prove useful to others so I worked on a hobby website to do just this   Here it is   https   stake tax  https   stake tax  Hope folks check it out HAPI Anything that is Solana oriented i posted it mainly in here  Twitter isn t my best place to share the info How many have  cope drops tho From my understanding 420 is just the warm up https   coinmarketcap com currencies solana Coinbase just listed SOL the other day  If you scroll down on coinmarketcap you can hit  See all Markets   maybe there is one that works for you  Beside that  maybe have to find a friend who is willing to trade you some directly it can take a while for it the show once youve  created the stake account  give it like 20 45min i hope one day they make a better interface  but this is what we have for now USDC is the most used stable on Solana  USDT isn t too far behind It would be cool to have a bridge if Terra soon i meant their CFO  but their being investigated  i don t know much  but i ve seen articles and videos of them being sketchy  i don t deep dive on binance because i don t have my money in there so i don t really care lol but i just rather use a different exchange No  it isnt built on serum Oh sorry  My bad Honestly  this is quite bad
2021-06-20,35.23702572,35.92838763,31.36209393,Coinbase pro  binance us  voyager  crypto com  Gemini I m not aware of all the options  I ve just been using Coinbase to purchase and then move to Sollet wallet  Fees to transfer are so low and extremely fast on Solana  ‍ ️ Binance us Eth 2 0 could never kill sol  It s not scalable and won t have near the tps solana has Same Sir  I wish you ever reviewed a business plan in your life  Office facilities  equipment  bandwidth in the next 2 3 years will cost maximum 5  of the  314m Solana just raised  They will use that cash on marketing because they realized that they can t convince developers to build dapps organically so Solana will spend on marketing to raise awareness among developers and then will offer them grants investments so they can build dapps people can use  This is not a bad strategy  It s the smartest thing to do and hopefully it will yield well Tech startups spend marketing on Organic   gt  SEO  blogs  podcasts  articles Paid   gt  paid Google Twitter fb ig ads Affiliate   gt  social media influencers  affiliate websites Second for uphold Sir  I m happy to answer your question if you would like to have a rational conversation and if you re actually curious to learn more  I m not shilling any token and don t have any emotions towards any  I just want to find the best token to invest in and learn along the research journey As you know about 30 40  of Solana tokens are owned by SBF  a16z  Multicoin and Polychain  SBF also owns Alameda Research  VC  HF  and FTX  Solana is continuously marketed on FTX platforms  YouTube  Twitter influencers are paid to make Solana related content  Tech startups rarely spend on print ads sir  They also spend on performance marketing  paid ads on Twitter  FB  etc   but this is targeted towards developers who might build dapps on Solana Solana targeted end users with the help of SBF and influencers and reached a critical mass  But the problem is there is a very small dapp ecosystem on Solana thus end users still use Ethereum based projects more than Solana  check Ethereum DeFi TVL vs Solana s or check transaction fees generated from NFTs  amp  games on Ethereum vs Solana  Sir  I d recommend you to chat some people in the tech startup world  You don t need a marketing director to spend on marketing  A marketing director is being hired because the current spent has been inefficient in convincing developers to build dapps on Solana  Without solid dapps  end users  no matter how shilling they are  will churn and go to another platform  and shill that token Yea but speculating that far out especially with such a young asset class is impossible However I agree that the asymmetry on crypto is still pretty good  The most you can lose is it going to 0 but the most you can make is unlimited I love solana Kreechures running on Kin  SPL  is a great NFT game I have SOL on Uphold Which country are you in My country has a service that allows me to DCA in through a bank transfer   There are a few out there USA  swanbitcoin com might be worth looking into Are there any guides on how to make generative art on SOL that anyone knows of Coinbase and Crypto com  SOL not available for US Well considering how other coins have dropped way more than 5    5  is good lol If you have been trying to contact them about the extended warranty on their car  it would be worth a few cents CryptoKickers  https   cryptokickers com Anyone have access  What is the TL DR They have to meet a payroll  pay for office facilities  and pay equipment and bandwidth costs  Landlords and suppliers like fiat money  What purchased ads can you refer us to Gotcha   thank you silver bug  although I ve been out of silver for while Serum is completely built on Solana  Ftx is not GOAT video I m lmao over here  The COPE dumbbells were a nice touch  This is why I SOL LFG ladies Solana summer Considering that Crypto is a speculative asset  It s not entirely impossible   I m sure no one would have thought Bitcoin would have done so well 10 years ago You pay a small fee to Serum  I think priced in SOL  when you transact  What this really means is you send SOL to an address controlled by the smart contract used to deploy Serum Serum is developed by FTX Alameda Research  same company   So ultimately  I m pretty sure they control how those collected fees are then allocated I haven t doubled checked this for precision  but that s the general idea that project is in the works i guarantee  all clever names will be used asap This is correct That s the price target my crystal ball is giving out too Oh yes  it s live and well  just look at Serum DEX  there s an explosion of stuff going on out there Did you not hear that inflation is canceled last week In theory but its hard to tell until said blockchain is handling the traffic  attacks and money of btc  It s easy to theorize for any chain that they solved fees  speed  security but until they get to btc level and do it is another thing I ll check out Phantom then  I just bailed on Solflare to move over to Sollet and have been enjoying it so far  ‍ ️ phantom is just better  sollet seems to get stuck sometimes  UX UI is garbage compared to phantom What specifically is happening this summer that has everyone saying  solana summer  or is it just investors excited about potential price increase and marketing So to understand correctly   you pay no fees to Solana for Serum  It s completely independent What s wrong with Sollet Ftx is not built on Solana  The ftx team built serum on Solana  Ftx lists a bunch of Solana ecosystem coins  But ftx is a centralized exchange and not built on any blockchain  It s a great on off ramp for the Solana ecosystem Oh god    youre right  Awful name too  Solarium would have been better Coinbase the easiest    Set and forget its already starting Star Atlas NFTs gt 1 40Hhhh Absolutely  Welcome Coinbase  crypto com Thank you SOL community  I find this sub full of knowledgeable and educated people   A newbie friendly place It s antiquated  Fees are too high  transactions too slow  The more transactions the slower and more expensive  This is not so with Solana  In fact it is so strange that Eth continues to be where it is with the amount of better blockchains out there  Hundreds of them  It s possibly one of the worst and yet it s number 2  However it paved the way and will always be remarkable in history no matter what happens  Buterin will always be a genius what will happen on eth Man those team bios on Solania s website are cringe  Definitely turned me off from that project wow  bought another at 33 earlier sorry Within a block  leaders get to arrange transactions  Transactions themselves are not timestamped  PoH is used to sync block production  consensus is still PoS If you trust a website that has SOL all time high at  1 40  then yeah it makes sense Thanks for all your hard work with this wallet  Is there plans to add a mobile app or rewards tracking mechanism similar to moonlet Have you used this website s predictions before  it makes sense Thank you  I ll check it out Your post has been automatically removed

certainty  we all would be rich  In a new market like the crypto one  TA doesn t always work  In fact  most time doesn t in the mid long period It took 24 hours for it to reflect  I ended up pulling everything out of Solflare  moved it to Sollet  and then started using Raydium LPs  Don t regret that decision one bit how is it now  was it successfully added Your post has been automatically removed

prediction  https   cryptocurrencypriceprediction com solana coin price prediction What is the potential Asking for a Friend Where do you think all that VC money and FTX backing goes to gt  Solana spends an enormous amount on marketingI don t think this is true The main reason is that Solana is heavily backed by VCs  FTX owner Alameda  Polychain  a16z  Multicoin  who invested massive amounts in Solana   314m only last month   Solana spends an enormous amount on marketing and is creating a big hype but the actual usage of it s platform is actually low and few of the community members actually understand how Solana distinguish itself from other L1s or what Solana s pros and cons are well you asked for it Moonpay is garbage Lol it s like  150 to get back in now I told you so just doesn t seem to cut it     P Can I call it a freefall now the same thing just happened to me with 2500 usdt  i restarted my computer but theres no change i can see  NFI what to do It s out and growing fast lots of projects already out and more in the pipeline there has been more submissions in this hackathon then decembers one by 10x Newly listed on coinbase and krakenKramer mad money advertised itHackathon gave it a huge amount of publicityStaking locks over 65  of it so doesn t allow you to sell easily  need to wait 2 days to sell  so no knee jerk selling reaction  350m raised from big boys VC believing in the projectFTX built on Solana  that exchange is becoming one of the top out thereGood technology  people believe in it   it feels they are FINALLY figuring out that they needed PR to help develop  IMO they are still shit in that domain  but with time it will get there  ie  Kramer puff piece  It will not rally until cryptos get another leg up  and this won t happen until the Nasdaq rallies   unfortunately with inflation gathering speed and the reality that it will likely not be transitory   all coins will suffer for the short to medium term  Could get some bounce up here and there but trend is not fantastic  I am staked because at 10  on solflare that s enough protection in my view  We could get another round of covid and thus some more QE and printing that would certainly help the coins here  Institutional adoption is starting slowly as well  Long term this is a good gamble  If you compare to some of the dog shit alt that are in the top here it clearly has a better value proposition  Let s see  I have today 70  of my coins in SOL 15  in a mix of Cardano  Polka  and BTC  the remainder is in ETH  SOL is better than Cardano  DOT I don t know enough but have a small stake in it  ETH if they get their 2 0 very soon could kill SOL on its way up  IMO Video no longer available Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the

questions or concerns Thank you  Wish I had found this sooner  Spent half a day trying to troubleshoot Does the Solana has Smart Contract active   or its in pipeline And whatever city they re in  If you re in a developed city with great transit  I d sell the car too  Depending on how you travel It won t go up for ever and it will have cycles yes  but  some top coins  like the top 10  basically do go up over time if you have a long time frame  Some lower cap Alts will go to zero but solana is fighting for a top ten spot off the value prop of fast txs and txs  second and a big community of devs  So it does have the possibility of staying there  Outside of that  it s just had big news lately  Investments  coinbase  hackathon etc Prices change   fundamentals don t If you believe   stack Agreed  but isn t Solana also positioned to benefit in the long term from the influx of traders Oh  some actual sense SolFlare now supports rewards reporting  thanks for the reply though I don t copy first  and 2nd  your impression means nothing to me  Who do you think you are The world moves on to web 3 with a tepid golf clap  I m all in after the final dip Your post has been automatically removed

 to  r solana  if you have any questions or concerns Market follows btc  majority still trade in btc pairs  i e  using alts to trade to stack sats   some exchanges also use btc as bank  Leverage also

world where many illogical stuff existed  Like it or not  it s part of history as BTC is the first mover  The leader is missing so no upgrading or improvements  But because many holders long time ago who also the rich know how to manipulate the whole market  Just like some asshole dictators commies still ruling this world where their citizens know how shitty of that government but since many official policemen general benefit from it so the system still exists  BTC is somehow the same  So next time  don t try bash BTC everywhere especially on  r CryptoCurrency because that how your word become target to bashers and BTC radicaller I like that you titled the post solana in a solana forum  I think it s because it was still undervalued against some of its peers  By not dropping as much as others it has passed some in marketcap that it should obviously have been above  Maybe a better way to put it is it wasn t as overvalued as some  But I m also a guy who hangs out on the solana reddit so I could be biased Yea pretty much that and I ain t gotten any for sale 5  is great to you This happens with every popular crypto  It won t go up forever  Just give it time and you will see that it s not magical and has market cycles like everything else
2021-06-21,35.26143549,35.49761474,25.94907889,OK  then I don t know  But it would probably help if you said what DEX you re using  what wallet you re using and what error message you re getting  Also be aware that anyone DMing you to help is almost certainly a scammer I have ray in my wallet and it s substantial  I have made a few swaps over the last few weeks but have not encountered any such issue  Lemme know what needs to be done Did you add RAY to your wallet first Mango markets lending and borrowing and raydium staking That s the next bitcoin halving  It s always driven off that   We are entering a bear market or will be by end of year   Bear in 2022 2023 then next bull run is 2024  It s not hard to study the previous cycles I am proud of my 1 SOL If you re using a ledger you get paid in SOL into a private key that only you know about There aren t any bears my friend   You are just an early adopter into a great technology Out of curiosity why do you think the next run is then and not before or after  Let me borrow that ball Damnnnnnn  That s a ton of coins  Just for shits a giggles what s your prediction on the next run in 2024 2025  I just like hearing where people think it s going I ve been wondering this as well Waiting for  12 DCA in  one Solana every DIP   Will be worth 100000K one day Getting so tired of trying to onboard people and telling them they need a code I bought 2  hurt since I first bought in at  2 50 Do we need to set a reminder to check again in 2025 These prices are amazing  Load up now next bill run your be glad you did Love It Fuck Welcome to the club of 1 SOL hodlers   people will envy you in 10yrs Absolute boss I do love the charting capabilities on the FTX exchange   However I wish FTXUS had more tokens to choose from  amp  the ability to stake SOL on platform Bruh Fuck Very insightful thanks Hell ya Got some pills left  Seems its FREEFALLING I hate to be right on this one  LoL So     now Low enough for ya Why are you so negative Do you mean  ONE Big Bag  more of Solana HARMONY ONE Done  that s wholesome af One for the road I see how to configure auto deposit from my bank account to binance but is there any option to automatically convert this fiat deposit into SOL Wow  You just edited your previous message after my reply  For those who didn t see  the previous message was full of humiliating words to me and my family  This is how low you are  You don t even have the honor to be honest about your message and personality  This is what happens when you put all your savings in tokens you have no idea about  Good luck flipping burgers SOL is now listed in coinbase  Is USDT via SOL supported  Any Coinbase user mind check please 1 coin only  meh gahh bahh brahhh You deserve an award Why is this news  Geez WHALE ALERT Buy on coinbase Binance send to MathWallet and use the dApp Was dipping below that last time I checked   And I bought at 35 lol this  except use phantom  sollet looks like it was made in 1998 good luck to you I am curious about how staking works on Phantom   Does it let you pick validators   Please tell me it lets you pick validators 35 big ones that does not fix the problem Can anyone suggest DEFI apps in solana for passive income  Thanks I am using solflare  Any difference between solflare and phantom Has anyone noticed that Blockfolio charges a pretty big trading fee  It seems like they up the price of Sol by 1 5  whenever I buy it I m buying on FTX US and staking on SolFlare with a Ledger NanoX Hey  First of all start at sollet io and make a wallet  ThenFTX pay to ACH  gt  sollet io  gt  raydium io  gt  swap usdc for those coins  and there are some staking pools farms for all of thos I believe Phantom wallet is the way  find an invite code in some of our gitbook docs  Use raydium to stake and to add to liquidity pools  Step finance will help you manage things in ray lp  Also check out rope  the soon to be volatility index for crypto  mercurial  the stable coin solana vault Also  I stake on Sol in a separate Solflare wallet LedgerX Nano with a non custodial Solflare staking wallet Np  You can go to the validator section of www solanabeach io to see the APY word thanks Not just a thing with exodus  As more people stake there SOL the APR decreases  This is the same as every other PoS chain It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links

really good with lending and their rates are really nice  and not just for SOL tokens  Binance  https   accounts binance com en register ref 20993669  is also really good for staking I am currently staking in both FTX and my Exodus wallet  Had an amount on FTX that I staked a while ago  and then whatever I bought after I would just put in Exodus and then stake it Just an FYI tho  Exodus has gone down to around 7  APY from 10   It was never really 10   just being reflected properly now Coinsquare  http   coinsquare com register r 7qFyk  since they have auto deposits available  Canada   or Coinbase if you re in the US You could also use the Crypto app  but their fees are kinda high after your free deposits period ends  Crypto app is great for automatic deposits  FTX  https   ftx com  a 18171645  to deposit from other exchanges to get SOL  They re also really good with lending and their rates are really nice  Not automatic but I like the manual transactions Both the Crypto app and  Binance  https   accounts binance com en register ref 20993669  have been good to me with purchases then transfers  but it would be your preference  Binance isn t auto deposits did exodus announce when or why staking would go down Coinbase Good catch  Yes not in voyager   I didn t see that post is in Solana Reddit Personally  I bought on Binance and stake in my Exodus wallet Buy with Coinbase  Use 2FA  Read about self custody and when you re confident move then into a wallet you own get tf outta here you cant buy Solana on voyager This is why I said whether you re interested in having an intellectual and rational conversation  Since you don t have anything intellectual or analytical to say  you re hiding behind humiliating sentences  Good for you Just bought  0 37XXXX SOL  Making my full total         3 I m staking through moonlet but is there a better option  I don t like how they create a new staking account rather than just combining the total into one Hmm say I bought 50 sol at  20 sol and then 50 sol at  40 sol  Then I sold 50 sol at  30  Ideally it was the sol at  40 that I sold so that I have a loss rather than a gain that I have to pay short term capital gains on  Does this software automatically optimize for that ftx pro 10 apy It took several hours for me Based on the price right now it would need to be  831 a coin  Which is possible but ethereum isn t going to be at this price on the next run  It would be very hard for it to catch and pass ethereum I think it ll flip ETH I ve finally made it to 23 xxxxxxx and I can t wait to keep going  I gave up chasing DOT to focus on SOL  It s only up from here As I mentioned this is a question how come SOLANA is not affected that much in the past few weeks  And yeah  PORT is down now  Hope to find some people who will be a little sensitive today  It s important to be nice to anybody during this moment Staking adds another layer to taxes  Still nothing to be afraid of The fucking buy  not just say Hold my dude I m holding exactly 100 coins all the way into the abyss  Those are my coins  you can t have them gt It s because 1  SOLANA is staked so it s locked up and people can t sell easy  2  Once you realize the potential of SOL you won t sell it  Just buy more Replace  SOLANA  with any L1 token that can be staked and you get the common answer of a shiller who has no idea about the underlying technology  Learn more about Solana  it actually has real potential but also has some risks  Make your own view on whether you re willing to take that risk Aged like milk https   www validators app Good tool for comparing validators to stake with pls help Share some of your solanas here for poor people 4SPsGrRXRzpif49HZKtHUtcUcEdUDR7zLfbndc75vRe8 Tell it to go lower so I can accumulate more Want to buy one but don t have meney Let s go 3k incoming By then SOL will reach 3k You were sounding smart for a second until you mention you own CARDANO  and it still looks like the market is pricing in transitory inflation still so My man Please make a post once sol is supported  ️ Looks like multiple people have mentioned this one  I ll have a look  Thank you Yeah US as well Lol Ahh great to know  I ll

you say so  Such a pitty for such a good project  Crossing fingers  Will update from here  thank you indeed They say it take some time  some people reported it may vary between 15   30 minutes  some say even more  You ll have to wait a lil bit more so you can see your Staking account through their UI  They are working on fixing this issue You can always check your Stake account through SolanaBeach io Consider put more 10K on POLKADOT same problem here  access my wallet via ledger nano x then created a staking wallet and transffered my tokens and left enough balance for the fees then I transferred my token to the staking wallet  however  they are still not showing up after a long while  quite nervous  crossing fingers same problem here  created a new wallet via Ledger nano and then created a staking wallet then transferred my balance with enough balance left for fees  however staking tab doesnt show any balance  i am too very much nervous That would be wise You are right  It s idiotic Are you posting from your alt account  Otherwise I m confused because I never had a conversation with you lol I ve also found  METAPLEX  to work Hey  if you owe taxes that means you made money   I did crypto taxes for the first time this year and it was kind of a pain but it only took up a couple hours of my life Don t let taxes stop you from making passive income Nothing sweeter than making money while you sleep  even if it s only a little Go go Scallop Just checked  Exodus has 7  APR which is pretty good IMO  Can t find out how much SolFlare has but I ve heard good things about SolFlare But rayidium either solfarm allows you to farm solana with rayidium  What to do If I want to farm only solana  Is there any platform that allows a good APY  such as 60 70 80 or more Exodus is a good option  as is SolFlare Where can SOL be staked  Exodus This is awesome You think it s going to dip below  29  31 Can u short the market using raydium Hey there  Aymon from  cryptotaxcalculator io  https   cryptotaxcalculator io  utm_source reddit amp utm_medium comments  here We re currently in the progress of integrating with SOL  we ve just added BNB and MATIC We work with all non exchange activity  such as onchain transactions like Airdrops  Staking  Mining  ICOs  and other DeFi activity Happy to shoot you a message once SOL is supported Having 5k 10k Solana coins means you will make it to Valhalla in the medium to Longterm  Those staking rewards are like 5 10 SOL per 3 days right now This seriously touched me  I have 6  and I swear I d send you one if they weren t staked  But I plan to buy some more once they hit my target price in sats  DM me your Sol address  I ll send you one then  and you hodl it until it s  1000 worth  Deal This guy fucks You take the LP tokens you would otherwise farm in raydium farms and deposit them at solfarm  They auto compound the rewards raydium pays out  they buy additional LP tokens with the rewards and deposit them back   and you also get rewards in the form of their tulip token  which you can also farm on solfarm as well  I ve been using it since day 1 and like it a lot  You can also check out solyard which is similar Yes and in quantities more than I need Short srm to fund your blue chip accumulation  Safer that way when your delta isn t leaning too far in either direction You mean  100 million in due time I m always amazed by how much money other people have  Do you just go to the grocery store and get whatever you want We ll be removing the codes soon I guess I ain t buying til its only up 200  from last

bitcoin solana Same  brother SOL price prediction  https   cryptocurrencypriceprediction com solana coin price prediction Why are you estimating 1700 per coin  Where d you get that number  ETH had a market cap of around 300 billion  224 billion now If Solana were to get to that lofty market cap  And that s a big if  as it s so new  and needs a ton of adoption  you re looking at an approx multiple of 40x Which would price each coin at about  1150And that s assuming no new coins enter circulation Honestly it s just an educated guess  Solana isn t a Top 10 crypto yet  I can t imagine anymore than 1 percent of crypto holders hold more than  500 USD worth of SOL  Especially when you consider that BTC still dominates the way that it does  I could be wrong tho Use Exodus Time to seek safety in that ole btc boys You were saying My goal is 500 sol by 2023 Where did you get that statistic  Just curious That s da wei man  keep going Nice brother  I have half a sol myself  one day a full Stake

down to some  10  20  I d like to do some bigger buys at that point How so   Did you have bad experience with them So proud with my 32 SOL  D Honestly tho  If you bought a  29 coin now and sat on it for a few years then it s an absolutely no brainier  Lol  I maybe the Micheal Saylor of Solana  Lol That would be nice  That seems to be a common and realistic prediction 1 2k  I d be happy as hell with that  I ve seen some way higher but it s anyone s guess Yup that s my plan to just keep buying over the next couple of years  Hopefully the next run is good to everyone Decentralization and security A centralized project will probably not be an ETH killer I m estimating 1 SOL at  1700 per coin in 2025 Nice  I m with you man  I love my SOL Are you hitting max  If so  that s the issue  You need to save a little bit of SOL for the transaction nothing but FUD    Time to double dwn Agreed  Consolidation bear for the next few years now  Just got a big bag on the way down  and holding from

send stable coin from paytrie to binance   coinbase AgreeI hope btcGoes to zeroItsAncient tech HAPI will be deploying on the solana blockchain as a sol token aswell The hidden GEM is in the fact that BocaChica has turned within just 2 5 weeks into an ordinary unknown launchpad to a big almost  separate project  that is backed by a huge VC investor and exchange   has the most advanced security protocol in crypto integrated which means no more scams at this pad  No more hacks or rug pulls  Which is highly needed  Its become and will show to be a premium launchpad that shows the perfect use case and effects it has when hapi protocol is adopted by a blockchain or exchange  That s why solana will fully adopt it end of year but also the partnership with kucoin shows promising signs since if you know your math and remember the Team saying there were some exchanges highly interested in HAPI and the new roadmap contains milestones dealing with CEX integration Thanks mate  Makes sense  I will await the white paper  I m assuming the hapi round on solana will have wrapped hapi because it doesn t live on solana yet  Ty As long as you have your seed phrase and or private key safely stored somewhere than you should be good 1  Hardware will get cheaper over time2  There s nothing inherent in the protocol which keeps the number of block producers small  Once stake is spread out then the blocks produced will be made from a variety of producers  Though it might be helpful to add in some kind of stake saturation method to expedite this 3  Fair point4  Fair point5  Fair point I ll try it  I just want to be protected if something ever happens to the Sollet extension or website Sort of  The seed phrase generates the private key  which is really all you need  Every wallet is going to need your private key in some form  whether its just the string of characters private key  or it s the seed phrase that  when entered  gets translated into the private key It depends how the wallet works but I think Phantom  for example  lets you enter in either the seed phrase or the private key Solflare seems a bit clunky  are there any more mature wallets with a little smoother   prettier user interface If you want to restore your wallet into another wallet tat supports using the Seed words or Private key  then yeah you may do that Nothing here  I am sad I have my seed phrase  do those words work across all SOL wallets Just with how vague they are with the payment methods that they accept  They were all too eager to get my driver license and other personal information and then not respond to my support ticket  Tell me they only accept certain types of credit cards  So I say moonpay is garbage  If they would accept other methods of funding I would probably change my mind but they don t care so I don t care Cardano has a much more powerful PR machine than SOL   they have gained fantastic levels of adoption  It s the same as Bitcoin  popular and has gained acceptance amongst the crowd  You don t win by having the best tech    I still believe biggly in SOL and think that they ll get their act together but they are not there today Where as for inflation that is transitory   load up on long term junk bonds then and put your money where you mouth is  Let s see how you do in five years  I am long short duration  convertible bonds  banks and material equity stocks long term  and then I mess around with things like crypto and the odd tech company short term  I like Chinese tech but that s because they are completely undervalued inflation or no inflation  I ll underperform if inflation is  transitory  as you like to say   or I ll crush it long term  This is not including my residential portfolio which I am very fond of and have seen appreciate for the last few years as the BoE and Fed went trigger happy on the printer  To each his own  and you are entitled your own view   I am not here to argue about inflation but only Solana on this sub  I would check at the difference between the March meeting and last week s meeting    That dot plot didn t scream transitory  it said we have no fucking clue When you first created the account you should have made a copy of the private key or seed phrase  as long as you have that or can export it from sollet  then you should be able to access that account from whatever wallet you choose Crazy hardware requirements   A Few dominating block producers   No on chain governance   Centralized leadership control   Centralized coin distribution Make sure that the particular platform you re using is reputable   many are  but don t assume the particular one you want to use is without due diligence So the hapi round you send hapi to purchase the project being launched  50  is burnt 50  goes to development fund  If you want to earn bocachica to take part you must stake sol with the chosen validators  We have more news this week to clarify all including a white paper for bocachica Thanks for showing an interest Same  Then piled right into Raydium farms lol  Love Solana Figured it out   What he was referring to was the  Nakamoto coefficient    the minimum number of entities required to compromise a critical component of the system So here Anatoly is claiming that for Solana  the top 16 node operating parties control 33  of the stake   This means in order to censor Solana in any meaningful way  16 separate parties would have to collude    Compared to Ethereum where currently the  top 3 mining pools control more than 51   https   etherchain org miner  of the hash power in the PoW system  and apparently the top 4 staking entities control more than 33  of the stake in ETH2 0  So while it is more labor intensive to run a node on Solana  a trait that usually causes a consolidation at the top  currently the number of individual node operators that control 33  is high compared to pretty much every other blockchain   Hopefully the coefficient increases over time to make the system even more censorship resistant  but time will tell At least I think this is what he was referring to  please correct me if I m wrong on any of this stuff Hey thank you  How will solana know I have hapi tokens that live on bsc  Hopefully a bridge or wormhole will be done in time I m going to limit myself to a purchase a week Thanks so much Your post has been automatically removed

to growth and price appreciation  Being on Coinbase and Kraaken tells you a lot right now  Accumulation happens and is happening  3 years from now people who bought today and held will be retired wealthy  Look for Solona to post gains of 5000 to 6000   Its that good If you take your cues from the Bitcoin Market you will know the next halving will be significant  The pricing in will be occurring well before Solana will gallop along outpacing those with many years headstart Its the real deal  a gamechanger I believe you can do that with any site that sets up a metaplex instance and allows anyone to create an NFT  Check  KermitX  https   nft kermit exchange   instance  they also have a  guide  https   docs kermit exchange We don t need anymore RFI clones anywhere in the crypto space Is this only for people outside of the US  I can t find a way to buy SOL on crypto com  Do I have to take my Harmony somewhere else to exchange it I think stuff like that is usually restricted and read only  so it can never change anything nor can it see anything that is supposed to be private Of course there are still risks involved if it doesn t work properly totally support this project goood When people are capitulating is the time to buy right now My goal is 1 SOL by the end of the year  I am proud to have 0 SOL  but I will work towards my goal Honestly just stake them and forget about em  After a year of staking you ll avoid more capital gains taxes and risk selling too early too Keep buying and staking Does anyone know what Anatoly was referring to about Solana striving to  maximize the minimum set of nodes that are up to 33   The discussion starts around the 45 min mark and at around 47 40 he mentions they have the highest number  around 16 or 17  which is twice as much as EOS and 4 times ETH2 0 Can anyone explain what that number refers to and how it relates to censorship resistance of the chain Same here for in for only 100 nothing major but enough to start my SOL journey After 5 6 hours of waiting  fund showed up  Thank you indeed After 5 6 hours of waiting  fund showed up  Thank you indeed funds showed up after 5 6 hours of waiting I want to buy more  but I think I m bias right now  Any rational thought My aim is to get 100 SOULS Your post has been automatically removed because your account does not meet the minimum age required to post  1 day   I am a

you have any questions or concerns ya that s way outside my risk profile lol Yes  You borrow srm and sell it immediately  If srm s price drops you buy srm and repay the debt for a profit Takes time  should be up after a few hrs A lot of people are hanging on the ETH 2 0 upgrade because gas fees are lunacy  If they keep pushing it out and delaying it  I think SOL will get much more attention Ah so like leverage kinda Try it on Step Finance  That s what I use with Solona There great Is SolFlare even compatible with SOL based dApps Yeah I ve been wondering about something similar  How can capital gains tax be applied to a virtual asset when one moves location  Is it charged to the country where you presided when you initially bought the asset  It seems so arbitrary to a newb like myself Downcycle is definitely here but SOL is poised to be one of the top performers once upcycle resumes Good day to buy more Mango allows you to borrow  Borrowing is a form of shorting Have you tried swapping instead It hurt to buy today since I originally bought in so low but wanted to catch this dip while I had some cash flow The validator doesn t actually have custody of the delegated sol  You own the withdrawal address you can get your sol back after you undelegate and 1 epoch of cool down period Great stuff Thank you Very hardworking team as well as the admin  I think this project gonna be huge  love you all Woow congrrats  ️ ️ I fully support It s easy Correction   bought  this  dip I just grabbed more  I love these discounts and as a developer building on chain with a product that s not ready yet  the cheaper prices means cheaper cost of production Fingers crossed not a dead cat bounce I know I know  I am in the belief of get rich eventually  I think this bull run is not my chance to go far  But for sure on the next one I ll be ready to go Then hopefully soon I think there are some things that you need to take advantage of and this is one of them  Don t be sad about things respect what you have and when you get the chance get more Wow nice   Price is going up from there Its not about hope at all  It s a certainty I m having trouble figuring out a way to buy it in Canada Hopefully  Sitting on a real big stake with the buy from today How do we know it s not Solana and other Alts going down that is making Bitcoin go down First time my pay day aligned with the dip    I love crypto that way   always gives everyone a chance at the damn thing Me to   Thank you dip Hah my bad never posted usually just read That s one hell of a title I bet I know how you feel today    Don t worry I m the same I believe so to  I m sooooooooooooooo bummed I don t have enough fiat right now to buy more  I will again in 2 weeks  By then the price will return to normal levels doesnt matter what exodus says your sol is worth  its not an exchange I already shipped my solana to be staked  will they be lost or will they come back solflare is a good option  you need to create a solflare wallet  create stake account  go to  solanabeach io validators  https   solanabeach io validators  and find a validator with a low fee and then delegate to them in solflare  there are youtube videos that teach you how to do this Wrong  Everything is still strongly correlated to BTC at this point However I will say the strength SOL has shown in the face of BTC weakness is one of the reasons I m long term bullish You guys are going to make so much money doing this  Solana is going to  400 00 and anyone who buys now will retire in 2 years rich beyond belief  Congrats now Hold On for Dear Life  HODL Thanks  Yea I looked back and it went back up was sweating for a min lol It s a glitch with the app should be fixed now Lucky guy There s an exclusive hapi round which is also the first round on bocachica  There is a bocachica token but it has no financial value  its more like an access token You can earn bocachica tokens by staking sol with certain validators to be announced soon Called it Got myself a nice bag Love getting paid weekly I just want an easy way to mint my own original NFTs on Solana like I do on Ethereum Yup  Waiting to go back to sub  20 which was my original position How do I do so Will do How s that working out  so far Is it safe to connect products like that to your exchange accounts Got another week for payday  let s hope this dip is still dipping then You can leave out all the  sir    It sounds quaint You failed to substantiate your claim that Solana has spent much funds on advertising  so kindly retract it No homo  but you re a good looking guy You are correct DCA down Still dipping Dont spend it all in one go  make sure to spread your buys out so you can average down  I also bought more Lucky you  payday is another 2 days for me  Probably gonna buy a little now with the stable coins I have sitting around and buying more SOL along with DOT and KSM later this week Waiting for my paycheck to do the same  D What type of wallet do you have  You just need to delegate to a validator Added 100 tokens today can t believe this discounted price Would you look at that  all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order I have checked 23 354 087 comments  and only 7 133 of them were in alphabetical order Only difference was I used Mozilla  You could try opening the developer console to see if there is a more explanatory error message being given there  It might tell you which function is throwing the error Im using Sollet  amp  Staking in Raydium dot iobrowser   tried both Safari  amp  Chromedevice   Mac   Ipad  amp  Iphone Well  this post is a month old and you still can t pull it from Binance US  Wtf  Isn t it a separate entity from Binance Bitcoin dropped below 30k  Every coin is about to take a massive dump What wallet are you using  I used Sollet and it worked smoothly once I figured out where the approve screen was Sol is in a discount now Not entirely sure  will HAPI holders get any benefits from Boca chica on solana or there will be a Boca chica token seperately Would you look at that  all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order I have checked 23 230 325 comments  and only 7 099 of them were in alphabetical order another  50  is on the way Mine is showing unknown operation  unable to harvest even after i click approve 59 sol   buying another 5k today   love the discount don t rush    still its going down HAPI definetely deserves more attention Good news True word Massive news for  HAPI  Holding strong in this dip I m so excited about that first project  Boca and the Hapi team are bringing the heat  Stock up while you can  I know I am How does a team apply for this funding Ignore fud  Only buy sol Guys  check out new Great Ape YouTube video  All information for Great Ape token in there  Join the Revolution https   m youtube com watch v aGITWUbA26Q HAPI gonna be gone from circulation very soon    y all better get your bags before becomes  ultra rare Drop more more more I want at 1  to buy Exciting news just keep coming Boca chica partnering with kucoin and Solana is so smart  Who doesn t want to start their project via boca chica when it includes Solana integration and a very possible Kucoin listing  Well played team Once boca chica initiates   HAPI is going to fly   no one knows about it but already partnered with Solana and KuCoin yet just a tiny  10m MCap Hapi which powers Bocachica  is the Beast of all Beasts  Destined for greatness Hapi is hands down the most needed saving grace to blockchains as a whole rn   it doesn t matter what kind of market this will always be needed the protocol is just too butter smooth   no more rugs no more theft or uncertainty   filling the roust gaps of that we used to have to shrug and think  as well it s defi so that s the risk I guess  With  HAPI we will feel like DOCTORS handling our transactions no worry of misconduct     VERRRY  Bullish and love  SOLANA I Love these posts     Great stuff thank you Can you clarify what were you saying about begin a fake account  Are we talking about HAPI in general  Cuz I m looking to invest in HAPI a little Shall do HAPI is a low cap gem For the moment  i did not find any I though about buying ONE more Solana too  But I figured I ll wait until the market finds some Harmony  No one what this market will do You use the word  farm   but you can stake SOL on binance for  13  APY There is also Solanax   https   solanax org and accumulating Solana getting cheaper everyday  Of course my portfolio is getting smaller to Def start with Phantom wallet  Use an exchange  preferably  FTX US  https   FTX US   as your deposit place   Then go buy your stuff and learn a bit with raydium  maybe try  solfarm io  https   solfarm io   stake some Solana with solfare  if you wish   But Phantom wallet is the one you want to use for sure Solana keeps going the past week  I just recently got into crypto   I bought at  43 based on what I have seen on projections online  I bought additional to cost average to around  40  I feel sad  my timing is off in purchasing   But today as of this time  it went down to  27 also states  not delegated I m also having trouble  I can t seem to add an address for delegation  it keeps telling me create a delegation  if i already did and deposited money to it  how can i find out and did i just lose 300 Now is a good time to be building Welcome aboard We re adding the ability to stake inside of Phantom  For now you ll need to use another staking interface though Now you just need to lock it up on  Bitrue  https   apps apple com app bitrue id1435877386  to earn 12  APY   P S  you have to time it right because it sells out pretty quick  They have information on when the daily cap resets And if you re interested in finding the best

telegram What   This is promoting Sol  HAPI will allow sol to be what it deserves to  Please educate yourself No flipping way sol has more transactions than ethereum  I d love to see the source data for this chart thought this was meant to be a good coin  not something getting outperformed by btc gt It would probably be a great idea for the Solana team to collaborate with the Axie Infinity teamIt s up to the Axie Infinity team to decide whether to migrate   use Solana or not  They are the ones to decide what s best for them  amp  their project  May be their community can help with this  amp  ask the team of Axie Infinity to have their project run on Solana You need to make your argument even more clearer than this  Have a better argument s why you think it s centralized  Give us the technical key points that made you think it s centralized so experts give you the best answer Good luck If the project is legitimate enough  amp  not some kind of shitcoins  then it might be featured in the Weekly digest  Trying hard to cover the majority because the ecosystem is growing fast  so if project X is not featured this week  may be it will the coming week s how can we get the response from the cli calls to the frontend How can we have our project featured here Literally the first thing i did waking up Had a car crash yesterday  can t buy dip this month sadly I got this image from https   www coinparticle com Why is that funny Thanks  Will check these out Been trying since yesteraday  Nothing Create an account on ftx  Transfer any crypto to your ftx account and buy some solana and stake it there itself Or you can move solana to exodus wallet and can stake it there Well it seems like a network issue and I tried again today and it all worked out well  Thanks Lessons learned That could be 1 2 Sol or 3 Sol  depending on the day of the week You egg This wii be a game changer Who bought at  50 Wondering how  still didn t find a solution You got a great price   I bought at 21 5 and again at 21 75   I didn t think it would go back down to 21 5 and then it did   Still happy with price I did the DOT SOL double nvm just needed to be patient  it s there  Excited to try out staking on Solana and compare it to the other coins I ve staked It s usually an option   You can select which method to use Correction  bought  this  dip Uughh bought at 28  The dip to 20 happened

make me uneasy about the underlying security of the the crypto themselves  I guess the wallets are made by different people but still  it is not comforting  Monero GUI wallet also gives me pause I only read a portion of this but how could they possibly regulate it if they don t know that I even have it Honestly f    BTC And we re back at  30Most resilient coin right now and rightfully so Why do

beta Congrats Everlend Finance I got  5 what can that do What about others like Exodus Anyway  I m sure I tried to trade two coins I already had on my wallet  but this fee was charged TWO times  Are there any place where I can complain about that That helps  but I don t know why that fee 0 023 it s very high I have no   technical   idea how their SOL wallet works there  how they access it  but if it is the SOL wallet we all know  they it s a piece of cake to send any SPL tokens sent by mistake to their SOl wallet Is it possible though to move tokens from an associated token address that s been created by my Binance SOL account when I accidentally sent USDT there from my Sollet wallet  When the SOL wallet received the mistakenly sent USDT it created an Associated Token Address and out the USDT there  It s essentially inside my Binance SOL address  It can be seen on the blockchain  I believe Binance must be able to access it and somehow return it  But they say it s impossible  Trying to brush me off  So now wondering if I could move this via API   I m not sure even at Binance side how this send would be initiated  They d need to get at that ATA balance somehow to send it   presuming there s no UI for this   they d have to use API too Haha I always ended up in a worse position doing that too  I have studied a little trading analysis  but even experienced traders find this very difficult to do so I would strongly advise against it personally  or you ll get wrecked  I like to plan for the worst case scenario  personally  There is a good chance that if you go all in right now  that it could go to  14  and then you may lose confidence in the whole thing and sell lower  Buying a little  often   over months at a time   that s what I m doing  Again  not financial advice I do think to much about what if I had sold and re bought back in  I have tried it a few times and ended up in a worse position  But I wonder if other people try to time it or think about it    I do believe SOL has a bright future  I m just trying to accumulate as much as I can while it s cheap It s a risky thing to do  and I wouldn t do it myself  but you do you     notfinancialadviceWhat I m doing is watching bitcoin  as alts tend to follow whatever BTC does  If we are entering a long bear market  I think Sol could go a lot lower  No one really knows  Google  dollar cost averaging  and think longer term  It s the best way to avoid volatility when the market is uncertain Bit disappointed that the grand prize winner is seemingly closed source I store and stake SOL on u atomicwallet  It is a non custodial multiasset wallet  available for different operating systems  desktop and mobile So wouldn t it be smart to sell a bit to have a bag of USDT to buy back more after it dumps I think all alts will dip again  once bitcoin bounces off the 200 daily EMA  Solana is a good project  but things are looking bearish for all alts right now  I m just excited at the opportunity to get in on the project after missing out at the beginning of the bull market tbh pity for them  putting the price before the tech  It s funny that btc was considered shitcoin as well at the beginning haha Thanks The jam Just stumbled on another one today inside the Solana documentation   DEVDOCS Whatever you do don t mention it in the Bitcoin forum  I got banned forever for suggesting that Solana is safer  cheaper and faster then Bitcoin  The moderator called SOLANA a shit coin Me neither  Solana has truly unique technology and stands out from the others  Would be weird to ignore its features and lower the price Jason pezzio said today that he thinks SOL is overpriced and will bleed out over time back down  I m not so sure Happy  As in you also got a bag of some  Hapi at least when I got paid xdxd  But still  it has a pretty low price atm  I expect the return on where Sol belongs and much higher True  I m in California  And FUCK binance   Us She s literally stupid thicc  ‍  ‍ You think it will hit  20 again agree  sol didn t go below  20 lately  I barely think it would hit  16 soon 20 or something again this week  this would be the last chance to buy it this low Where can ich fund more Airdrops Dank Ahaha   Binance i türkçe kullanmak doğru bir tercihmiş O  Good man    you might not wanna click my hyperlink then hehehe yeah I don t really think you understand the gravity of the situation buddy  https   youtu be dQw4w9WgXcQ when you transfer or trade a coin not listed in your wallet  from my understanding there is a 1 time small fee to  create  or add that coin to your wallet   Being said that i find 0 023 Sol very high fee for that    amp  x200B hope it helps set a calendar reminder and purchase on blockfolio  SBF  FTX  very easy   safe   no fee s I hope you re right  it would be a great entry point for me  What makes you so sure Can you use Atomic Wallet    You can swap for SOL and stake there Well done  I just watched it hit the bottom and had no fiat to buy  Made me feel crazy I just went in with a few k of investment myself  LETS GO 1000  2000 easily One thing about SOL is that it bounces and recovers quick  This is gonna do good things when a bear market comes once this cycle is over Glad i grabbed 200 at  22 yesterday   Didn t get bottom but happy with price i got at Solarians are dope  Solarian marketplace will be launched soon   If anyone wants to buy solarian   https   solarians click  r GR8SG1 The easiest way would be to open an account on binance and wazirX and then deposit INR to wazirx  Exchange INR for USDT and transfer it to binance and buy Solana You can then either stake Solana on binance if the coins are less or transfer them to Solflare wallet for staking Thanks for positivity  I hope so too Solana is the real future of crypto   it s on SALE still     buy  stake  and HOLD aah i got u  Sorry 2000 No  I m answering your question to the other guy  I assume hes using binance us  Because binance com is rarely has an issue wow  m just asking mate  i dont use it I bet he s binance us user It s easy to have a clear head during this crash when you re invested in something with a great future  I d be stressed if I was deep into a meme coin because they have a harder time recovering from something like this Into the 200s seems about right In big at 39 as well  Still happy with that price m selling if it hits 200 why Some day it will reach the ATH of ETH Whats your realistic long term SOL price target  I m talking 4   5 yrs from now Yeah Sol at  40 is still on sale You should be able to use this   https   github com vidorge solflare decrypt  https   github com vidorge solflare decrypt   On Linux  you can just clone the repository with git and then use node to run the command in the readme on your solflare keystore  This will get you a file with your private key screw binance Still very nice gains considering the current state of the market  It shows some real strength Bought most at 30 and averaged down a lot yesterday   But even with 40 there will be huge gains If the receiving address of your SOL wallet in Binance is 100  correct  then you ll have to contact Binance support about this matter Just smiling and staking  These short term movements no longer impact me https   twitter com binance status 1406895844134211586 s 21 It s not a rise  It s a little recover from the dip happened before   I bought at 40 The  fud  I was saying to ignore was the price drop on all the sol ecosystem coins  I like Hapi You misunderstood  I m only buying sol ecosystem coins If you think long and medium term  I don t think it will cost much to sell  We are only at the beginning of the road and I think solana has great potential  Not financial advice Yeah  Because it got whacked so hard yesterday  It is just people buying back in after selling Yea    for 10  interest     iv been staking forever and nothing to show for it Thanks Prfekt DMs are open and your suggestions are welcome Thank you  Really appreciate it Did you check if the transaction is on the blockchain and matches with the binance address Okay  fair enough   May I hint to take a look at  https   streamflow finance  https   streamflow finance

its own language called solidity  Solidity looks a lot like simpler languages like python and javascript  very much typescript   I d say it is a lot simpler for programing beginers as well as experienced devs Solana uses rust  Rust some day might over take the C   standard which almost all high performance software is written in  Rust is a language where less errors can occur and it is just about as fast  However C   and rust are not simple languages to learn for new devs The argument about solana having an easier language has two points  1  Finance runs on C    rust is similar to C    and those devs will easily convert over  2  Learning rust means you can work on anything using it later  solidity is just smart contracts  This can mean that devs are more likely to pick it up The counter point is that solidity is built for that reason  Web3 devs  javascript frontend  can more easily learn to write solidity than rust Better depends on who sees it  Imo it s the best store of value rn   Solana has 1 great advantage over every other blockchain and it is  that is incredibly fast and cheap to make transaction  that s why i d prefer the developers to keep focusing on that and make SOL the exchange coin in the crypto world  and maybe in the real world  someday   Jack of all trades  master of none Eth  might  reach 100k tps just like Solana  might  reach 1M tps  but as it stands Solana is capable of 10 15k today without any upgrades sharding compromises  as a developer  that matters  It s hard to build out a platform on a promise and what  might  be Insert butthead cackle Thank you for the add man  SerumPulse looks amazing Stupid question then  Wouldn t it be smart to sell a bit when it hits a high so that you can re buy back cheaper  Like 20 Absolutely BTC is a comparison  LN  liquid  and taproot all make it a robust protocol  I hold mostly SOL and am bullish on it  but BTC will be on top always and forever which is OK I listened to a prominent Bitcoin podcast yesterday  I ll link below  where they had a large crypto VC on that was annoyingly a btc maximalist  She believed that LN on top of BTC is the only protocol the market will ever need  Wouldn t even consider ETH or another alt to be in the conversation because of its lack of track record  All roads lead to LN in her eyes  It was a bit sobering to hear it come from someone who clearly has a lot of influence in the industry  https   podcasts apple com us podcast we study billionaires the investors podcast network id928933489 i 1000526562477 another one  https   trade mango markets stats I lost 9 SOLs transfered from coinbase to binance 24h ago  correct adress  Disgusting binance dont answer emails  Dont know what to do That s not a bad analogy  as long as we re talking super generally about this  Lightning s specific strength is with small payments between two parties who have already established a payment channel on chain  so  it can fail between people who have never established a channel if there s not enough  liquidity  for the payment in the protocol s graph   Ethereum and Solana are general purpose computers  and can run literally any type of computation for a price Just keep in mind that Solana compromises somewhat on decentralization to get its better throughput  By that I mean that there are fewer parties hosting and maintaining the Solana network  because the requirements to run a node are higher  Some people will say that this is no issue  and I respect that  though it s a nuanced discussion If Solana works why would someone build on other chains  Do they get the crowd that likes higher fees and worse performance gt ADA I believe they have made so developers can use any programming language It s not like a blockchain needs to be designed from the start with multiple languages in mind  as long as it has a robust  documented VM  you can add languages on at any later date even without a hard fork or L1 upgrade  This can happen on Solana  Ethereum  Cardano  any chain whatsoever if there s demand for more languages  My guess is that there just isn t much demand for other languages  because any competent developer can be comfortable using Solidity or using Rust  and the chain s main language is where all the developer resources and tooling are  gt I know of several people that have said once   if  I know I know  smart contracts go live and they can develop using something like Python they will be developing Dapps like they are going out of fashion This seems really silly to me  personally  I absolutely love Python and it s one of my go to languages  but for smart contracts  why would I want to use a weakly typed language with its syntax maimed and smart contract functionality awkwardly bolted on when I could just use Solidity  an easy to learn language with familiar syntax that s designed specifically to write smart contracts As a side note  have your friends looked at Vyper  It s the  something like Python  that your friends are looking for   a smart contract language designed to feel very similar to Python  without bringing a lot of Python s language cruft that just isn t relevant or performant for smart contracts I come here every week for this weekly update  Just fantastic curation by u ansi09  Would love to see more news of data sources and dashboards rolling out  Things beyond Solana Beach and TVL metrics on

No idea then  Sorry It is not capitalized  It is the exact same way I have saved it  I tried using another web browser but it is still showing the same thing Make sure the first word isnt capitalized I can t find anything about the team behind this token  who is the top former hacker you meant For those looking for a summary  amp  x200B https   solana com news announcing winners of the solana season hackathon Solana has 50k tps proven  now  and is scalable  Also has 400ms block time and tons of dapps already built on it Radix says they will have 50 tps  1000x less than solana  in 7 days  And 5s block time   As far as I know  no dapps These two projects are not comparable in my opinion I meant tps lol sorry if I wasn t clear Congrats   Where can I learn more about everlend I m a user not a hodlr so I m more interested in how each network operates than the price of it s native asset   It might go to 100k  nobody knows    But I ll tell you one thing  in a world with a 100k Ethereum  Solana holders would have made orders of magnitude more than that I m very clear on market cap  I spend waaaaaaaay too much time on way too many apps and browsers looking at cryptocurrency charts and metrics   I won t disclose my position on either coin for my own safety  but what I meant was that SOL is attractive because the price is so low   Yes I realize Bitcoin has a much larger market cap and yes I realize BTC has first move advantage and huge adoption   Yes I m aware of lighting network and taproot and London upgrade since we are also talking about ETH    To get back to point SOL is dramatically faster than all of them even with their upgrades   I think the best option is to have a position in all three   In SOLs case your still early    SOL is one of the few coins I d own outside of ETH and BTC Agreed a summary of all them would be great SOLbridge i guess  since this was the winner in the HAPI organized competition Ah  I use brave and still need Firefox for MetaMask  ironically   I ll try that  Thanks Dona  HAPI MD was the head judge  my guess is many of these will be launched on the Boca Chica launchpad  HAPI made for  Solana I like it  It s more about infustucture for the sol network but when they expand the bridge to all of the blockchains it could be a decent size project yes as that is what the trend indicates  Until it reverses expect it to continue Works on my Mac  but need to use Firefox gt hat make it faster than Solana  Sorry I m not really familiar with the tech all that much and just to be clear I am a Solana guy and not trying to shill bitcoinIt is faster because it is not written to the block chain LN opens up a channel that basically says  Hey I will be trading with this person record the following transactions  Then you transact with that person until your business is done and then say hey I want to now use my bitcoin  The channel is closed and each participant ends up with the determined amount of btc That means transactions will be instant and free  except for opening and closing the channel  Now you obviously do not want to open a channel for every vendor or person you transact with so instead you open a channel with someone who is connected to all the vendors  You can then transact to the vendors through them  Of course this person would need a large amount of bitcoin to remain liquid  They would also receive a small fee on each transaction  Also I guess they could leverage the unused portion of your bitcoin to stake or trade with Ohh wait I described banks bitcoin just invented banks again XD  At least that is my take on the LN Look solana has a working solution right now live on the main net  That is absolutely incredible  I am blown away by the speed and cheapness of the solution  Every blockchain can technically put a LN on top of their chain it is not difficult  However  it goes against the whole point of a block chain you may as well just trade on a centralized ledger Vitalik has said it might reach up to a 100k tho Fro where I can buy those So many projects  so little time to research them all 1   An institutional handshake  2   Strategical Investments  inbound and outbound   3   Triple support confluence Why do you say is too decentralized  IT has a lot of validators and being one is cheaper than eth  no gpu needed Anything  except LN  Because there is no TPS limit on LN  only liquidity limit Unless the upgrades somehow magically increase the TPS to 10k  per second  reduce the time it takes to process a transaction to under a second  and reduce gas fees to less than 0 001 cents    Then they do not compare at all to Solana I know this post is a little old but I can share what worked for me  I m in Hawaii and don t have access to any exchanges but I was able to use simpleswap io to exchange for sol  It s stressful because it took a long time but it worked Bitcoin is a Ponzi  Eth and Sol are both needed and Ethereums speeds still arent making it  hence the pushback to 2022 I know it gets a lot of hate in this subreddit but ADA I believe they have made so developers can use any programming language I know of several people that have said once   if  I know I know  smart contracts go live and they can develop using something like Python they will be developing Dapps like they are going out of fashion BTC isn t a comparison  it s a pure currency and not a general purpose smart contract blockchain The competition is ETH  ADA  BSC  Neo  Polkadot  etc Ultimately it will come down to adoption and which blockchain developers think is the best to use  coding  security  speed  cost  etc After thorough research I concluded that only bitcoin will be the real crypto  Why have any other if bitcoin will eventually have smart co tracts  host nfts and much more  And is adopted by countries already  I don t want to sound like a bitcoin maxi but I see no need for any other crypto  Bitcoin will be better  faster  more Efficient than any other in a few years  It will have everything ethereum wants to have and is backed by the most important and biggest people in crypto Eth2 0  still believers around that think it will be out next year after it has been delayed so many times now Now is the winter of our discontent made Solana Summer I know  my question was just how the upgrades for those two would compare to Solana I think the competition will be mostly user sentiment rather than technology  Ethereum is more mainstream as of now  Hopefully  people become more aware of Solana and its capabilities This might be a very bad analogy but the way I understand it based on your reply is that bitcoin lightning is like a GPU in the sense that it can do one thing payments  extremely fast but is slow at or rather can t do everything else whereas Ethereum is like a CPU in the sense that it can do a lot of things decently fast Solana is a combination of the two taking the best of both worlds Has t thee ev r hath used solana    t s bitcoin and ethereum yond hav the keeping up to doth     I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout Have you ever used Solana     it s bitcoin and ethereum that hav the keeping up to do Sharded With sharding That is only a start I don t have first hand experience with either language  to be honest  As a developer  focused mostly on c    my impression has been that Rust is just a bit easier and happens to have a lot more people with existing fluency  It s not that solidity is fundamentally flawed  and that s good to hear that you

For me its eth 2 0 vs Solana Learn what is market cap gt So would that make it faster than Solana Yes  in the same sense that typing a letter on a typewriter is faster than using a computer and printer  It s only a valid comparison if you want to do an extremely specific  limited thing In the case of LN  sending a simple payment to someone you have an open payment channel with  where the channel has liquidity available to make the transfer What I like most about SOL is I can buy 1 126 for the price one one BTC     Also it s fast gt Solana may have some advantage in attracting talent because its programming language is a bit more approachable Is it  in your opinion  Based on the smart contract programming I ve done  Solidity is a very readable and approachable language for what it does  Its developer resources are second to none How does the experience actually compare  writing Rust on Solana Maybe because it s not the truth  but two half lies If you have the time  there is a great unchained podcast about this Link here  https   unchainedpodcast com how solana and binance smart chain could take ethereums lead Agreed  I really love the Solana project  proof of history is genius and the chain is very performance optimized  It is still very early days  so hiccups are expected  In the end UX will win though  I m actually thinking about trying to stake through the CLI since solflare has caused me headaches  I m using Ledger Nano S  Chrome completely borks and Firefox won t let me create a staking account with what seems to be a very common error Failed to sign with Ledger device  U2F OTHER _ERROR I ve been misinformed So would that make it faster than Solana  Sorry I m not really familiar with the tech all that much and just to be clear I am a Solana guy and not trying to shill bitcoin The truth is like poetry   nobody likes it What do you mean by this  I thought Solana was completely open source 200 300 in two years Don t forget about inflation  https   decrypt co 60395 upgrade reduce supply ethereum gets launch date eip 1559  tho Do you already have Sol on the ledger  If not could be the firmware isn t up to date or latest version of Solana isn t installed on there  Perhaps not the recommended derivation path  I use Chrome and never have a problem with windows I kinda feel like the secondary layers will get complicated  buggy  and expensive  I like the simplicity of SOL s approach to just be fast in the first place But isn t Solana a better store of value I  ️ SolPunks Did you click on the solana app on the ledger Also  i think solflare has a lot of issues with windows  It currently has a warning on the bottom Safe and efficient code Time to ape in to GREATAPE Ackchyually I think DASH  ADA  and XTZ are the competition As long as ETH has an unlimited supply and favors the roll back of chains I doubt it s going anywhere when cryoto REALLY gets adopted by masses  No one wants to hold a theoretical unlimited supply of anything I believe that as they grow every blockchain will take it s specialized space  like BTC could be the analogy for gold  ethereum could be like an environment for developers to get financed  and solana could get into the NFT world and be a reliable method for interchange  They don t have to fight  i believe they could coexist with each other LN isn t an  upgrade  to Bitcoin  it s a layer on top of the base chain  LN settles at the speed of light and has no TPS limit  only liquidity limit There s likely room for all of them  especially in the short term  and as cross chain integration becomes easier  Solana may have some advantage in attracting talent because its programming language is a bit more approachable  I mainly look at Solana as a hedge against failures in btc eth scaling attempts Solpunks are the best thing going right now in the Solana NFT ecosystem Jealous  Good shit I m in California too  but I m using Binance  not  Binance US  https   Binance US  lol I think they will still be slower and more expensive than Solana That being said  I do think it will make Ethereum a lot more competitive Composability I m not sure that question make sense  what response do you expect  have you read the doc  Cli stands for command line interface  it s not a network call The most powerful sun god in ancient Rome was Sol Invictus  meaning  Unconquered Sun Stop posting this over and over again
2021-06-25,31.16853053,32.90251437,28.03508047,You realize that even running 10 000 tps for the next 2 years would require an increase of 500gb of ram per year  Basically 50gb per 1000 tps yearly  Do the math  only super computers will be able to run nodes one day  is that scalable Do these come with shareholder rights Seems accurate no In for the long run  Thanks It s doing so by going down less then others  I m not complaining   But it could be top 5 within a couple months without going up lol What just had the same issue  I fixed it with  1  uninstall solana in ledger live 2  installed solana in ledger live 3  quit ledger live       otherwise it keeps re connecting 4  in ledger  gt solana  gt settigns  gt allow blind settings 5  logged to solflare    Hope it helps Yes  far cheaper but still not zero eth is already fumbling the ball  Too many delays  Also sharding has lower security than Solanas eventual thousands of validators on a single layer 1 Lmao 2021  502022  02023  02024  4002025  10002026  02027  02028  2000 Take every answer here with a grain of salt  people on here are already emotionally invested  No one knows where the price will go on in the future  Research the tech and judge for yourself if you believe in the technology Damn those are basically my same price targets based on realistic optimistic outcomes Very cool So much stuff on youtube Ciao  I am interested  I am working as an Alliance Manager in a pharmaceutical company However  I am passionate about graphic design  I have several works thet I can show you  I am good with Photoshop  Illustrator  Premiere and Blender  I also did a commission for a crypto project a few weeks ago  Last but not least  I love Solana  I am used to Defi on this Blockchain  I invested in several projects Feel free to contact me  or give me an email where I can write you Wow what great generic ass info  Sounds like you have a general ass idea and no developers This is correct Actual validator returns are available here https   stakeview appThe person who made this video probably could have been more accurate had they visited that site first  but obviously not a lot of people know about the site Disclaimer  I made StakeView app This is good stuff  Would love to see similar guides to Solana s DeFi ecosystem  Who are the main players  What are their yields There is no way to price a cryptocurrency so tbh nobody knows  Especially an inflationary one  All depends on market level of hype  its greater fool economics I   Sol Expectations are that around 2026 the total cryprocurrency marketcap is around 5 trillion  If Solana is a top 5 project in 2026 they should be around the 160bln marketcap    so a very conservative guess should be around  600  In the long long term  7y  i ll see a  1000 SOL  But     it depends if SOL remains ontop of the game Nothing to crazy here  But a simple guide for anyone wondering  just put some content from the Solana TG into a video and simple walkthrough on where to go to stake I hate this cringy cult shit Atomic wallet let s you exchange for sol and you can move them or stake them from there But you can t move them or stake them on uphold U will get REKT I believe the ftx tokenized stocks were backed by some German bank  This is a swiss entity Sorry what is this  Are these syntheic  Does Digital Assets AG hold the stock and manage the tokens  Wacky Shit 5 10 years  avg Mum has an age of 45 5 years   Bring some lube my friend  it s gonna dry like a raisin Yea that might explain the additional cost  Still  compared to ETH I m sure it s very cheap  not just because ETHUSD is higher than SOLUSD  but because the txns themselves are cheaper It s a dapp called Metaplex  I think it s legit Keep in mind that there s the cost of actually storing the data for the media on chain  as well as handling all the transactions for the auction itself  and handling proportional payments if the NFT exchanges hands in the future Deleted Is this a true partnership with said companies  Or can a stock be stood up for any company without their involvement gt nodes would need a much larger storage requirement Archivers  https   solana com news archivers   solana s solution to petabytes of blockchain data storage I have no idea  but I could definitely see it in the top 5 most used at the rate it seems to be moving at  I figure ETH SOL ADA DOT all have the potential to be up there  but SOL definitely seems like it might have an edge on them all in a way if the adoption keeps moving a the rate it has been Proof  https   www youtube com watch v npcOzCtLUi8 Top 5 in 5 10 years  It s going there this cycle lol Yeah that s true  more transactions will cost more than a single one  but  that s true for all smart contract platforms afaik Top 5 in the future  Shit it s hitting top 5 this bull market cycle Interesting  is that some NFT platform  I d guess that those fees are an upcharge they are setting themselves  Minting an NFT on chain is dirt cheap If sol hits  250 I m gonna be loaded  It s going nowhere but up that s for sure Serum is a decentralized exchange built on solana  This is a good read  https   projectserum medium com an ultimate vision for serum 473a16e77201 God bless Solana  Let s freaking goooooo https   cdn discordapp com attachments 849844496941842432 857822180401610782 Screen_Shot_2021 06 24_at_11 19 00_PM png Really good question whether we d expect tx cost in SOL to stay flat or change as the network grows But there are definitely more complex operations that cost more  Do you know a way to get batch statistics on transaction cost across a wide range of tx s  The high I m going off of is from using the metaplex NFT minting and auctioning platform  Minting a decent quality jpeg costs like 0 01 SOL  but setting up an auction is more  like maybe 0 1  More complex contracts cost more SOL  right Sorry what is serum  I just started looking into this projects and read on Solana and the token Just keep trying and troubleshooting  read my comment above   and once you do  move that Sol out of Solflare  I d suggested Phantom wallet  Hope everything works out for you What you searching for  I don t have ButWhat I was searching for  found in Sol Have also just suffered this issue   not good SOL a has good tech  but we all have to realize that it takes more than that in the market  First there is the market  then there is the hype and then the usage  Meme coins are good at hype  HODL SOL as a long term asset  And dogcoins to ride on the pumps and dumps The fees being so low is what leads to so many applications being built on the blockchain  which creates more transactions to extract fees from and more scarcity Your motherboard is unlikely to support 128gb  and if it does  as a gamer  you overspent on your motherboard haha My gaming pc could be maxed at 128gb  I m just unsure if it s worth it Though SPL though https   www cryptokickers com   https   www cryptokickers com   is the website if anyone wants to play around  I am not affiliated That s the key really  SOL is posed to catch a HUGE wave  DeFi  and dapps in general   How it does will depend on whether or not ETH fumbles the ball  My experience tells me that once projects like ETH get large enough  it s hard for them to change  since many benefit from the status quo  Just look at EIP 1559 or the switch to PoS  these are major changes that have generated plenty of controversy and it s unclear how they will all shake out  Every time I hear the scaling plans and L2 solutions  they just seem a bit overly contrived to me  and I think simple generally wins  But ETH has a natural advantage as the incumbent and I think it s a scenario every SOL head should consider that maybe they do pull off L2  PoS etc  without a hitch and continue to be the dominant smart contract platform Nobody knows  Can we get some discussion going in this sub about something other than the price for once Discussion of the various components of DeFi platforms and how to use them  how to build and run blockchain programs  learning Rust programming etc  are what I am subscribed here to talk about  not to read the same price spam over and over again Ray sol LP farming on Raydium io at 50 08  APR right now https   raydium io farms Where can one see the actual code ON the solana blockchain   Because i always see github project but I dont seem to find contracts on the block chain to verify them How many shitcoins from 2017 2018 are still relevant today  I don t see people shilling Dentacoin anymore I don t necessarily think that memecoins like Shib will wither away to nothing  but typically projects with actual utility stand the test of time whereas the value of hyped coins are completely reliant on relevancy  Also keep in mind that meme culture is constantly shifting so what s to say that doge doesn t get superseded by whatever is coming next  Juicers today might be cheugy tomorrow Blah blah blah It would lead to centralization  Solana is literally giving out money for people to start their own nodes if you qualify  yes it takes high end hardware  yes it ll take a decent amount of money  so do most secure networks lol Eth2 0 requires 32 eth for example  I don t know about RadiX but for solana to continue to grow  this isn t as big as an issue as people tend to shout it is This guy is actually a shitshow We talked with him to enter a strategic partnership with us for promoting our new and exciting project r ShineDAO DeFi  amp  Options finance  We proposed paying in our native token so that he d actually have  skin in the game  and do his job more diligently  He refused We then offered to pay in ETH or USDt  He said he wants bank transfer because he doesn t want to hold any crypto for now  What a fucker  He wants us to believe something but in actuality he s something else entirely Sad for his 3 mill followers tbh Is this the way It s just fun brother Ughh  don t start all this culty talk nonsense in this space too My honest thought is that is will ultimately depend on how much SOL is required to use the chain to do what you want to do  If 1 SOL is  1000  then transactions are prohibitively expensive  if it costs 0 01 SOL    10 to mint a single NFT then we ve got problems I think the price could reach that high at some point  because insane moon why not  but I d expect the magic capitalism to take over as people actually start using the network more extensively So   200 possible improvements sound great  but several of us need issues resolved now and the form to submit feedback hasn t been working for at least 2 days possibly longer  i haven t been able to settle my SOL on solflare dex for several days now   and currently there s no way to submit feedback and or a ticket to even make the solflare team aware of that   that seems incredibly shady If you think this is the Google or Microsoft of blockchain like I do  then the sky really is the limit  especially if the nasdaq of the future is built on solana  The burn with 1 million tps will be insane  I think solana will be at 400 within a year  2000 within 5  Defi is just getting started Serum and solanas grand vision is going to come to fruition   this is just the start  This is incredible news Because there s still a ton of dumb money in the market OP here   Solona is settled in and rooted very nicely and deeply in the framework of cryptoccurrency when the bear market comes and all 331 million currently staked coins won t most likely move because they have a 2 day delay for withdrawal while Shiba inu and Dogecoin and these other shit coins will sell off faster then can goods out of homeless shelter  We have an actual ecosystem with protocol technology that makes us the next 3rd generation in block chains as well as the winning car in this poker hands   All if the others like Ethrereum  bitcoin  Atom Matic  Algo  etc  Yet they re trying to get better and faster and stronger by adding layer to protocols and by adding sharding  And our ecosystem and our blockchain is still based in layer one at the almost finished stages of the Beta and we have surpassed all of their odds including TPS  scalability and security    Just hang tight one day soon Solana will be the 1 that they are comparing bitcoin to let alone becoming the star cryptourrency blockchain check out this article   1 2 down the page they explain YFing on Solana  https   www coingecko com buzz yield farming on solana  https   www coingecko com buzz yield farming on solana  Based on data from DefiLlama  there s just slightly more than  1 billion in value locked  still a long way to go compared to the  25 billion TVL on Binance Smart Chain  This just means that there s still plenty of room to grow and plenty of yield to farm    As such  we will be taking a look at some of the platforms where you can start staking your assets and earn your yield right away  such as Raydium  Orca  and Oxygen  Note that currently  SerumSwap has been deprecated  while Serum DEX and Mango Markets do not have any known liquidity mining programs at the moment Realistic 2026   250  2031   500  Optimistic2026   500  2031  1000  Very optimistic2026   1000  2031   2500  I belive Solana will be at top 5 in the future old news  funny the way you put it though  this is basically ftx tokenized stocks if i am not mistaken  it s been king on for months At least 1000 USD Mirror of mirror      ️ IMO  ️   Basically adoption and utilitywhy is ETH worth what it is  Or BTC  Or shitcoin 10034627  Low transaction fees may accelerate the SOL USD value increase due to user adoptionAll assets are perceived value at some point   utility does change this and that s the major appeal of Solana to a lot of people At least SOL has more utility in comparison to let s say the USD   you can transact in Sol   build infrastructure for defi landscape   dApps   so much more   and it s not backed by debt what s going to cause the price to grow  outside of speculation  if the fees are so low   I can t imagine that staking ROI will be high after all of the tokens are in circulation due to the super low fees https   www solasystem io  peep the growth here Peak 65 000 TPS 400ms block times  0 00001 transaction costIf that doesn t smell like growth I don t know what does I m not sure I follow  What do you mean by interchange  Sorry I dont agree  For the record i hold no shiba inu  But I think you shouldn t underestimate the smooth brains  Look what happened to GME and AMC and things like this  They went up and never went down  People who buy this stuff have cult like religious beliefs arising from some deep psychological unfulfilled needs Today it can be true but in the long term all of useless shit coins will be forgotten  Nobody will remember shiba inu 10 years later  Everybody wants to become rich very quickly  When they realized this isnt possible with these shit coins then most of them will be dissapeared over time Interesting TBH i dont think this is true  The number of people who know about shiba inu is 10x of people who know about solana  And the reason is it is simple to understand just a dog picture on a coin  Telegram groups for shitcoins memecoins in general have way more members than on legitimate projects  They are a means if entertainment and people pay for entertainment We are going into a bear market Thesis  top 5 due to the fact this space is very very new  We are finally seeing the best of the best  true talent tackle blockchain projects  The dev team behind this thing is astounding  I also think in America one of the first real world use cases we will see widely adopted on blockchain are financial markets  SOL is obviously tailored toward this more than other blockchains and it s already picking up steam  Pretty much impossible to put a price prediction on anything and if somebody tells you they can  especially in crypto  they are lying to you  Anyways  if in a decade we are in a period where a couple industries have adopted blockchain and SOL becomes a top 5  it could easily be worth  500 2 000  Inflation is a lot  I understand that  But they amount of value blockchain can unlock in this world is not fathomable  can t measure it it s so big  There could be better blockchains built on PoH by then but like I said  I m betting on that dev team Secondary market via the discord is v active and the floor is around 7 SOL  Any views on the potential given there isn t even a proper market place for these    yet Ath of eth hopefully Is it possible to access solflare through the Ledger X while using an iOS device  I can t seem to get it to work  I ve tried chrome and Firefox as per recommended but not working for me Ok sorry I didn t read closely your post  Ledger nano X doesn t work with windows   But what you can try is using the Solana command line guide try access the wallet in cmd  You just need to using usb   ledger or usb   ledger key 1 depending on whether you have in root account of account 1 etc   Use that for  lt keypair gt  and just copy the commands in the guide to do what you want  send sol  get the pub key  stake it  Docs Solana com In the long term shiba inu will be forgotten dont look at this shit coin  they are waiting swap for months  I lost too much money on it  Everything in the market gets its real value in the long term  Im sure solana will be at better place in next 5 years I was under the impression that with the high number of tps  nodes would need a much larger storage requirement that would lead to centralisation  Will go through this doc  Thanks because the news only does so much  the adoption is happening at a very healthy and realistic pace  but believe   it will fucking EXPLODE past the Andromeda when the time is right Hoping so too  All in all it is a good message but I think a lot of people don t invest in the technology  They invest in the chart of the last 3 6 month Hoping so for a change soon In my opinion this is an example for the difference between value and price  In my opinion the price of Solana compared to the value is highly underrated

market  In general it s best to swap to USDC first for most coins  You can swap between SOL and RAY as well since the liquidity pool for that one is large too Would it be possible that you didn t win

hopefully we get some clarity from the team in order words  solana checks all of the checkboxes of being an excellent project  but transparency huge question mark here Moreover ledgers are great because  sure there is an advantage to only having one node  or server  that s hard to hack  but what if you had multiple nodes that are hard to hack  but you can even successfully hack a few of them and not damage data integrity in the network  that s amazing Conceptually decentralization is a strength of this entire sector  The whole paradigm is many to one  instead of one to many So in real terms  why would I want to centralize from one node when I could easily split nodes around the world near each high bandwidth utilization area  across networks geographies  and maintain transparency across my entire system Thanks a lot for the answer  I guess my question is why do u need decentralization when it is a permissioned private chain  Just use some central server instead Thank you  i

they can basically clone the main ledger for specific companies and set them up with nodes  so the information that would be  public  on a public blockchain is only public to them in their private blockchain   Now how is this good for the main blockchain you may then ask  well more adoption means familiarity  interest and buy in as well as developers that know how to use the tech  Which one day when let s say 100 mega corporations are using private or public blockchains all that data where they want can get connected on the main OG public blockchain and thus run up utility value price etc I m talking in general sense of transaction speeds and not needing to go to layer 2 to get cheap fees when I play with the budding DeFi projects like raydium and solfarm  All of the ethereum equivalents are currently much more polished and developed than what Solana currently has but the speed and fee make it a much better experience Sp500 200   Sp500 returns on average 10 percent a year  And what do u mean by crypto doesn t compound  Are u talking about dividends Of course noone expected an all in  But small exposure would have been good for them  Anyway defi has the potential to disrupt these stupid lengthy payment transfers of banks which run on COBOL  Also eliminate all these intermediary businesses formed by clearing houses  People can get free access to market data  These are all bad for GS  I hope they burn Exactly  They think we re stupid  We re not but the masses are and they know it I created a website recently to see your SOL staking rewards history  https   stake

history and wrote up a little code to do it  I recently turned that code into a website   https   stake taxGive it a whirl It still says  10  annualized staking rewards My example was in regards to Ram  basically 50GB per 1000 tps yearly accounts dB increase  which every node needs to store   Accounts DB needs to be stored in memory on every validator Reaching 50k tps and sustaining that tps for extended periods of time  eventually years at a time are different wouldn t you agree They mention that they use private blockchains  What is a private blockchain First  Do you mean ram or disk space  Second  they have already ran the network at 50k  tps with current hardware requirements  which aren t super computers   Tps will scale with Moores law salary range for rust developers  ty How do you use Solana Their conclusion was not to invest in Crypto Anything under  100 is cheap  SOL will be worth hundreds in 5 10 years  It can do things no other blockchain can It ll be interesting to see how centralized crypto competes with decentralized crypto CBDC s were super hot at the beginning of the bullrun but I ve noticed a sharp drop off in banks   govs pursuing or developing them  I highly doubt that CBDC s will ever gain ANY traction unless the government threaten us with violence  economic violence that is     Digital Yuan in China is a good example Payments is a tiny part of what Crypto is about so a CBDC would need to offer a hell of a lot more than just low tx fees or fast settlements this report seems so biased and loaded with fud  gt Policy interest rates are at zero or negative in most developed economies  and global debt to GDP increased from 323  at the end of 2019 to 360  by the end of the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic  We do not agree that the major developed economies the US  the UK  the Eurozone and Japan are entering a period of  higher sustained inflation because of these policies come on    really How someone wants to be paid is upto the person  Just because you own the project  have you stopped holding cryptos or fiat  Looks like you are just pissed he did not engage with you No problem  If you feel so inclined  making an infographic  based layout of Solana dapps and dex s would be awesome End of year 75ish  hopefully 100But 2022   Oh God  300 500  It will fucking rally like no other  And it will be solid af   new bottom will be 350 400 around August  1k 2023    Between  Sol and  Hapi  which has hacken audit logos now on coin market cap   I m bullish ASFFFFF They will change the world   and blockchain as we know it  Sol is just so fucking sauce   literally best of everything  I can t wait for the mass adoption  Oh and let me shill HAPI if it wasn t clear   1M max supply of the most needed and beneficial use case possible rifht now   no more rugs   Security protocol that partnered w solana via the dao boca Chicca   Yeah so get some HAPI and stick it up with sol Lmao Well tbh it is to be expected  since inefficient banking is exactly what crypto is disrupting Good catch man  amp  thank you for this amazing share Will go through it  so interesting  especially that it mentioned solana hehe Solana website is generally the intuitive answer Downvoted devils bank That s perfect  Thank you Suggest you start here https   solana com ecosystem I occasionally have to check solana daily Twitter feeds for new projects  A dedicated website with all these projects might be worthwhile  But there is no incentive to create it Where is such a rewards Cheers bud will do   can I stake out of phantom Hey  Thanks buddy  You are a real Messiah  Someone who doesn t think once before tossing someone s work into the drain  Oh yes  gotta appreciate your research too  Would u care to share that since YOU PROBABLY called it a scam  Crypto world is full of scams  Even the projects which have worked for years altogether ended up being exploited  But calling an upcoming project which has been part of solszn a scam is uncalled for unless you have solid grounds  I don t mind that information and I will be more than glad to post it out loud but PROBABLY does t or won t suffice Yup  It s what all these ecosystems are built on  but my initial comment was about this exact cost  It seems like as the price of any PoW token goes up  the network itself becomes less appealing to use  so this theoretically would put an organic cap on the price All I gotta say is they got a similar project on Harmony called https   www harmonypunks one    They cost only 500 ONE and that s like 29   They re at like 3000 minted of 10k so u still got a shot to get in at the mint value Like when you go to a restaurant and pay your food  you can pay it with SOL  in some future   I don t know if the developers are pointing in this direction  but it has potential since the velocity of transactions is very high    50 000 TPS vs  VISA that has 1 700 TPS  and it is really cheap to make a transaction It s a sales pitch  amp  probably a scam Volatility But why 2022  2023  2026  2027  are in 0 Good thing front running isn t possible on Solana mine went to 6 7  recently  You sure yours is still 10 Small ecosystem and lack of liquidity are basically not even problems  these things will solve themselves as the project continues to grow  Everytime I use Solana it feels like this is what ethereum is supposed to feel like Goldman Sachs needs to get a Solana wallet or two and to give speculation a break   Get in line and like everyone else  we are front running you  Goldman Sachs I ll look into it  Thanks My rewards dropped by like 4 percent recently  Kinda pissed about that  Anyone know where to find a better APY Maybe deposit your sol as collateral on mango markets and trade borrow you can gain better than 7  a year  Just an idea gt mand promptDo you receive a higher percentage this way  My rewards dropped by about 4 percent on my Exodus wallet so now I m looking for other options gt  DentacoinGood old times Agree  Realistically crypto is used as utility  not as currency  It can  but the mass adoption as currency will be as CBDC Closes with  gt 	we have concluded that cryptocurrencies are not a viable investment for our clients  diversified portfolios Totally agree Could you provide a link  That is probably true  I m 80  sure That s a pro IMO  It means we r early Great find  Kind of interesting that they call out Algo  amp  Sol  but shout out 2 vet use cases  LVMH  amp  Walmart  but don t actually mention VeChain This might be a very silly question  but what exactly are tokenized stocks if they are not just meme coins for the company  Are these just another issue of the stock and how do they obtain their value It s a good read I think the most interesting aspect is that most blockchain is tied to crypto currencies But     it doesn t have to be  Hence your crypto currency could eventually go by the wayside while other companies use an extremely cheap alternative and just pay with regular currency   No risk  just pay for service Great problem to have  amp  imo the ecosystem isn t small there s a wide diversity of great projects just early in development TL DR     My god  6O pages for mostly their FA s SOL  con was   small ecosystem Love to learn more about this project  I head Design  amp  Innovation at an AI startup  message me Well  the validators or miners have to get paid somehow  No one is gonna validate your transactions for free when it has a cost to them Exactly  I remember talking about sharding and the switch to PoS back in the 2017 era  Back then it seemed like it was only a matter of time  yet here we are 4 years later without much progress  I also wonder if switching to PoS and scaling will be incompatible goals  I don t know much about the dynamics but I imagine the PoW miners will thumb their nose when ETH turns their back on them and that will put even more stress on the network I think it would make zero sense to sell unlocked tokens for raising the 300M  if unlocked why not just sell it in the free market Hmm my sol ray srm portfolio is auto compounding
2021-06-27,29.75264012,31.92939059,29.27119729,I feel like there needs to be a bit more explanation as to what is going on  very long error messages that don t have much explanation for example   It just feels like I m sending my money into a blackbox with a UI that feels very unpolished and transactions information processing that takes uncomfortably long when handling my money  Maybe people who are more familiar with crypto feel less uneasy about it all though gOnNa bE  50k iN a FeW yEaRs bRo thanks Why Here Sounds pretty sweet Yup  Exo staking  6 7  as of this moment where do you guys keep these little SOLs  Seems like Exodus is the best bet for now Right  it just got listed on the base of Coin haha  I ll get the remainder for a whole coin probably eventually  Just wanted to keep it around my standard   20 price for fun crypto drinking buys  This seemed like a perfect amount for now Where did you buy it I was going to ask why not buy 1 whole coin until I saw the pic Exodus Understood The new potential FCA regulations in the UK particularly involving binance have me a little concerned and I ve been meaning to stop using their platform to stake for a while anyway so I m just trying to move away from them a bit and trying to catch my breath before I do much else  also from what I understand I can delegate from my ledger with certain secondary wallets 637 53   5 987 11   10 Radix is a ghostchain right about now Maybe Walmart in China is  Idk  This paper suggested that Walmart  USA   is using a private blockchain You really only need enough to pay for validator transactions  From what I m hearing its a couple of SOL per day  but you gonna need to attract other stakers to your validator as well  and that s hard without a good staking base  However I think there s some negative effects on the network with a low staking amount as well  so I d say 5k SOL is a good estimate for the validator to contribute to the network Sollet also works for me with ledger Exactly  Imagine when people start to realize how many eth 2 0  Validators are running on cloud services owned by a handful of providers lmao The hardware is necessary to make a  simple  layer 1 blockchain with incredible speed  Not only that  I think solana actually gives out grants for people that are actively trying to run a validator  Solana is still relatively unknown to the masses  and even if it isn t  true decentralization  which for know is a pipe dream with a ridiculous amount of downsides  you can still run dApps on it  the rest we don t know until it happens gt here are many blockchains that can achieve that You re looking to profit out of being a validator    That s the problem  if you want to profit out of it  you ll need to invest more money and have the required knowledge to do so  This is no free money and specially since validators are attached to the blockchain rules  if you don t you have to pay High rewards  high risks The cost of hardware is peanuts compared to how much SOL you would need to buy trade to setup a decent validator  What s the recommended bare mininum  5 000 SOL So  one of the key features of Solana  fast transactions  is only possible because of whales  Solana padding its stats Solana Foundation needs to help get this shit fixed  Huge barrier to entry not having a decent place to stake What do you mean  My understanding is that Walmart China is a  VET partner  using the tech  and Salesforce China just added a direct app integration last month  That and Wanchain  which the state grid uses  seem to be the killer apps over there IMO  Unless I m missing something I use exodus as well Cheers Cheers Right okay  thank you https   phantom app download Well shit  haha  Sucks for me  Maybe it s because I added more to my wallet Are there other exchanges that trade with USDC SPL Solflare was one of the first Sol wallets that allowed staking  It developed on 100  donated time  It was good to get people started  but we need something better  Would love it if Phantom would  buy  Solflare  Or even the folks at Sollet io   we need a better wallet to stake through that ISNT exodus  Can we transfer staking accounts so that we don t have to unstake  but the custody can move to a new wallet  Or if someone buys Solflare and  just makes it better ASAP Also there is a long queue of people already in line for it   If you got into the program now  it would be about a year before you d be  onboarded  and get your stake   Check out the Solana Discord if you want to talk about it  there are channels specifically dedicated to the foundation stake program Ledger live must be closed when you interact with the Solflare wallet or you will get an error trying to access it That was the only thing that caused me a hiccup as I didn t realize that to start with I just delegated my Sol via Solflare non custodial web wallet linked to my LedgerX There is no Bitcoin staking  but in terms of ETH validators  there is a 32 ETH requirement to stake  Even at current low prices  that s over  60 000  and at the time of this post  I think it was over  90 000  With Solana  there is a  5 000 tech fee  and no minimum stake  although I think around  50 000 is needed to be profitable   and the Solana foundation will front peoples  staking  This effectively makes the cost of entry to validating Solana much much lower than ethereum My understanding is that the coins will still be stored on your Ledger but the Solflare wallet is how you interact with your ledger instead of ledger live  Cardano is this way also  others too I would imagine It works fine once you figure it out I dont know if this is true   to be a good staker you need waaaay more money that on ETH or even on BTC  but this could change  the thing is the validator hardware is so high This comment made me think a lot  What you say makes a lot of sense to me Cheers Cheers Is that a solflare app to download on the device then  Same as I would a BTC app Nope  the entire blockchain which is very large is stored permanently with arweave  a decentralized permanent storage blockchain Exodus No problem  It s great that people want to learn more  It s just hard on Reddit because it s not a great medium for in depth learning  and a lot of people  like those invested in cardano  will just shit on other cryptos because they think it ll help the price of their own coin You can use phantom  Best wallet for ledger support  I created a solana wallet on solflare and then connected that to phantom So your point about there not being 684 unique validators is true  but you can say the same about any decentralized system  It s not possible to know how many nodes are unique if the system is set up correctly  In terms of scalability  Solana does not have a classical consensus method  so scaling up the number of validators will have no effect You can use ledger with solflare  nano s or x  or moonlet  nano x Yes they are  Apparently it s pretty easy to do as long as you aren t in the US Yeah  you are missing Solana moonboy energy This is the wrong subreddit to ask for critical thinking regarding Solana The intermediaries such as clearing houses  brokers  banks are replaced by code  Sbf  ftx  etc  are just in the worst case getting payed transaction fees proportional to cost of bandwidth and compute provided  Your point is not valid at all This is very helpful  Thanks With EIP 1559 for ETh coming in July  not sure Sol has a chance any longer 5k usd for hardware is hardly a big number  It can easily scale to 10k validators Are they still delegating   200k SOL to new validators  I have access to high quality equipment and am considering starting up a node try earning money with a few gpu solo mining see how it goes  If you go into a pool on solana you get 25  apy   This is till way less than current state ethereum where you get at least 100   But its definitly not charity I d use Rosetta Code a lot to go from code you know  amp  can understand  to the implementation of same in Rust  shown there true decentralization Decentralization is a nonspecific term that everyone interprets differently   It would be much more helpful if people would talk about specific properties of cryptocurrency networks so that we could evaluate them individually instead of lumping them all under one nonspecific term Solana is absolutely permissionless    anyone  can be a validator at any time   However  it is only profitable with a certain level of stake   Therefore  the number of validators is really up to the collective group of stakers to decide     There is no one who can tell any staker where to stake their SOL  so if the collective body of stakers want to support 10 000 validators  they can do so by spreading their stake very evenly   If they don t care as much about the ultimate number of validators being achieved  they will not Basically the number of validators is determined by how many the stakers want there to be  and no one controls that except the millions of people who have SOL to stake Here s a great article about the innovation on solana  https   medium com solana labs 7 innovations that make solana the first web scale blockchain ddc50b1defda The main issue right now is high skip rates  and I have studied this extensively   There are some self staked whales who run on AWS and Google Cloud that have exceptionally high skip rates   They don t seem to care that they are damaging network performance   They are just greedily running 100  commission self staked validators with tens of millions of SOL   And the crazy thing is that they could make the same amount just by delegating to better run validators  and keep the money in the Solana network instead of paying a huge amount to Amazon They are most of the nodes that you can see on solanabeach io that are 100  commission and have millions of stake   They are very prevalent in the  15    50 ranking  by stake weight  But that s what s both good and bad about a permissionless network like Solana  you can t stop others from using the system according to the rules  even if you don t like them That s pretty speculative don t you think  I don t see a single validator that is  ran  by any of the individual entities you mentioned  Alot of the top validators run a service for multiple blockchains  The testnet has over 2000 validators  I m pretty sure they can scale to 10k or more  but if you have any technical info on why that s not possible please share Thanks a lot Rust fundamentals is actually pretty easy to pick up  but once you get into macros and etc   it gets really hard  Coming from a JavaScript and Go  it was definitely one of the more difficult languages to pick up  but I really do feel like I can learn any language now  As you learn it and use it in practice  much more things will make sense Solana will  always  require high performance hardware and network and significant expertise   That s what allows it to be so fast   You can t build a race car out of junk parts  Decentralization  is a loaded term by the way   It can be used to make any argument since it has no specific meaning Thanks for your answers man  I was sincerely trying to learn more and got some useful answers  Will read more about them Because just because the barriers are high doesn t mean that lots of people still won t do it   There are over 600 validators currently   It s true that a lot of them are Solana Foundation supported  but all that has done is accelerate the growth in the number of validators   Independent validators would have  and still do  start every day Again  you should really be looking this up yourself  Anatoly can explain it far better than I can  But the main difference is that in a random selection  anyone could claim that they are the next leader  This is predetermined  But picking fights with random people on Reddit instead of just reading the literature isn t going to help you understand yes they would look like fools when 80 90  of these alt coins no longer exist in 3 years As posted elsewhere in this topic https   docs google com spreadsheets d 1HPU_uG3iJ_ns27CItdWGllW0c

pursuing or developing them  amp  x200B huh  based on what information do you come to that conclusion So block creators are chosen on a random basis in Solana  What s the difference between that and round robin selection or random designated leader selection seen on other PoS blockchains And how do other validators validate whether the newly created block is valid  Don t they vote  All validators need to vote in an all to all voting structure I really want to understand what distinguishes Solana from others since I have real skin in the game but I haven t met anyone who could articulate it so far or stablecoins Proof of history is somewhat of a misleading term  It s not a consensus mechanism  It s a method of time keeping that allows for validators  to rotate leaders and progress without communicating with each other  This speeds up block time massively and is what allows Solana to be so fast  And somewhat importantly  it is a totally new mechanism that isn t comparable to any other crypto mechanisms I read about proof of history at different venues  Isn t that just a classical consensus mechanism  What s the real innovation there I have a couple issues with this  First of all  I don t think more nodes decrease performance  It s true that not all nodes perform at the same level  but they all perform above the specified minimum level  I have seen no drop in performance so far even though the validator count has been steadily increasing  And TPS is still at less than 5  of its predicted max  so that number changing isn t really indicative of anything  Also  again  new nodes are being constantly added  And the Solana foundation is supporting their additions by lowering the cost of entry  And there are plenty of real technological innovations such as proof of history which allow for higher speed other than just better tech  That s not something that I can explain in a Reddit post  so you should read up on that yourself  in this post  https   medium com solana labs 7 innovations that make solana the first web scale blockchain ddc50b1defda   And yes  this is decentralized  There are not intermediaries  The only argument about Solana centralization is that the Solana foundation holds more coins than they should  but in terms of protocol  this is a fully distributed system Well the more nodes join the network  the performance gets worse  You can check this on Solana beach  Not all the nodes perform at the same level  TPS is volatile based on the designated leader node Sure you can have great performance without adding new nodes  but then you re not decentralized And if the main innovation Solana brings to the table is asking for higher validator specs  what stops any other blockchain from doing that Decentralization is what excited me about blockchain  I want to see those bankers and other inefficient intermediaries go down but they should be replaced by everyone not by a select few that invested early in Solana  VCs  SBF  etc The 684 number is tricky  It s not proven but kinda obvious that few players like the Solana Foundation  FTX  SBF  VCs  a16z  Multicoin  Polychain  are running multiple nodes  Requirements to run a hardware is so high that even Solana s official telegram group s admins don t run a node  So  that 684 number doesn t represent the real number of unique nodes  I doubt there are more than 100 unique individuals who run a node And I m not technically sure whether Solana can scale to 10k nodes since they are using a classical consensus mechanism Well it s not true for blockchains that require lower hardware  amp  internet requirements to run a node  If I can run a node by just using my laptop  then anyone can do it and you can realize true decentralization  There are many blockchains that can achieve that First of all  because Solana is just as fast  if not faster  than many centralized entities  In can achieve this because of the high minimum specs of a validator  And the Solana foundation lowers this entry cost by giving out tons of SOL to people starting validators ah gotchya  okay Why would you wanna leave sol  Just build something new on sol  BSC is centralized and ETH is slow and will be less secure with sharding than solana use  steaking io  https   steaking io   which will be live soon  or  solstake io  https   solstake io  which is live now Lol Not just Solana  I d say  What you are saying is true for most crypto if not all Cardano is not centralized because its nothing  when it has smart contracts and main net well see how it does What  Of course the details were disclosed to the  investors   that s not the point lol  The deals of a publicly tradable asset on a public blockchain were not transparent to the public and the entity that is issuing these public assets is choosing who to distribute them to and under deals unknown to the broader market  No way that is a preferred method by the SEC Again  just because you don t know the details of the investment deal doesn t mean it wasn t disclosed to the investors  If the deal wasn t transparent you think large successful investors and entities give money away without knowing any details That s absolutely non accurate in every way  The SEC wouldn t prefer public assets being traded to some entities privately without the transparency of the deal Because thousands of independent nodes can be spun up  even with these requirements  which is far different than using a centralized entity  There are already 684 independent nodes on solana  and it s very early  I expect 10k or more within the next couple of years Just because the sale wasn t public knowledge doesn t mean it was non transparent  The SEC would certainly prefer the sale to go to well accredited investors instead of the general public of retail investors Yeah Solana Foundation and all these VC backers need to focus on funding supporting a legit place to stake  Makes everything so sketch I hope so  So Solana s long term decentralization is predicated on future hardware becoming more efficient powerful and future internet becoming faster so that more and more people can run a node with lower costs without reducing the overall network performance For the short term you may be right  But things can and hopefully will change in the future as the technology advances If the barriers to becoming a validator is so high  what s the point of a decentralized blockchain like Solana  Let s just use a centralized entity instead to conduct the same transactions  they are much faster  have higher throughput and have lower transaction costs  Am I missing something here You could sell  300 million worth quite easily over a relatively small time frame Are you claiming the SEC would prefer a non public  non transparent sale of tokens to Venture Capitalists It s collateralized and redeemable for the shares  I also get all the rights as owning a share  Like dividends I checked sol volume today on ftx  Its around 14M  So I guess it makes sense Decentralized storage for the ledger isn t really the issue at play when people mention decentralization though it is a point in their favor Solana does better with decentralization that some coins  They have decentralized cloud storage for their blockchain  Some Coins rely on big tech name cloud services for their blockchain ledger history  Don t throw the baby out with the bath water Takes time  Learn and play with rust first  Perhaps create an api with rocket rs and serde then try Solana smart contract Solana smart contracts are not easy its very low level StreamFlow Finance rocks Lol this comment section  RIP OP Not new  I can see it now is there any analysis that shows returns based on amount staked delegated Also I ve heard you need a really

This is so stupid Where Ada I m a big fan of Solana and it is definitely better for the environment than a PoW blockchains  For anyone that cares about the environment  my favorite blockchain for being eco friendly is Phantasma  Especially for NFTs  which the blockchain has built in as part of its core platform functionality     https   phantasma io nfts go green with phantasmas carbon neutrality   https   phantasma io nfts go green with phantasmas carbon neutrality    So  if you want to be able say that your blockchain project is eco friendly and carbon neutral  then build it on

unmentioned  I own Vechain but I m reconsidering now  Why would a company use VeChain instead of doing what Walmart has done with their own blockchain Right  Where s ADA  ALGO  HBAR  etc Bruh  did you just photoshop a higher quality Solana logo into an old ass trilemma image  Half these coins have faded from relevance and Solana has known centralization issues  Why not make a chart comparing actual statistics for these three categories to convince people and show the quality of the blockchain compared to its current MC competition Solana is the Holy Trinity I don t know anything about Solflare at all  sorry   I don t work for them or with them Thanks  much appreciated Sure thing  Happy to help  Solflare only keeps recent txs around I think  But a block explorer like Solana beach is showing you on chain stuff directly so if it s there you can be sure it s real  And yeah I forgot to mention  everything stake related happens on the epoch cycle in Solana  So roughly 3 days for any stake changes  activation delegation etc Do you know if Solflare will get more dev support soon  I d really like to stake with them and actually stake with your node since you seem so helpful in the community  but I honestly just don t feel confident putting up much equity on Solflare    the slow processing and subpar UI don t inspire enough confidence Thank you to u Windscar1001 for the help  I m now seeing my staking rewards via SolanaBeach  For some reason  none of my transaction history is reflected in Solflare  But I can see the transaction history on SolanaBeach  amp  x200B Getting about 7  APR  Took about 4 days after initially delegating on Solflare to start receiving rewards I was only charged 0 000005 SOL to delegate Thats very good explanation   Thanks Saved its basically keeps your private keys off line  so even if there are Keyloggers on your computer it wont matter cause all transaction are signed with the ledger  Hot wallets like the ones you are referring to are more vulunbale to different kind of attack s   You instead oh you putting in your password every time and the spyware seeing it   The ledger adds another layer of security   That really isnt a good explanation   Just out  Ledger com  https   Ledger com  and they have some pretty good videos on it you tell me  https   youtu be dQw4w9WgXcQ Could have just not commented  that would ve been easier  Or mash random keys  Outcome would be the regurgitated misinformation and random virtue signaling that you done goofed here lol Ya isn t that what got the SEC to sue Ripple Probably hard to move 300

2021-06-28,31.88082998,34.243226,31.03512722,Awesome  really appreciate the info   always felt there could be something better out there  now I know where to start gt me issYes  worked for me too  Need to approve Unblinded signatures on the device itself  Cheers I definitely will build my next project on Solana  I love the ecosystem  but I m currently building something for an existing community that exists on BSC  and my thoughts are that it would be better if the token and its NFT projects are aligned on the same blockchain I didn t even know there was a hackathon happening  I ve gotta stay more up to date haha  Congrats to the Zeta team Yeah it was an airdrop to help get their validator set up  I also believe they are working with the SAMO Dex GenesysGo offers free SAMO   That s really interesting   I was unaware of this   But I found the medium article describing this and in fact you are correct   Interesting stuff Everstake APY hasn t been 10 5  for many months though   All validators were paying out a lot more in the February March timeframe when there was much less SOL staked  since rewards are divided over staked SOL  the more SOL is staked  the smaller the rewards to those who are staked  Everstake s returns over the past 9 days is 6 88  APY   You can do a lot better if you want to  see https   stakeview app Keep in mind though of course that there is more than just raw APY to consider when choosing validators   Pick small validators to help the network It really doesn t matter what they advertise though  the actual returns are known   Although I wonder where you are getting those numbers from   I ve never seen them before   From in app maybe   I haven t actually run their apps  just looked a their websites I d be happy to show you the door if you d like to leave Nah honestly since i started staking my SOL a couple weeks ago i have noticed some pretty mediocre returns  now the APY is like 6 7  but was around 10 5  when i put it in there  Thinking its time to unstake and make some steak elsewhere Are these 2 for staking SOL only  Is there a place where I can stake all other tokens from solana ecosystem Tbh I m not sure I don t use sollet wallet  There should be an address that goes rcxxxxxxx     Take that and paste it in the search bar on www solanabeach io there should be a token section but when SOL gets the volume ethereum has it will have problems like Exactly what I was looking for and worked like a charm  Thanks You may try https   bots bonfida org   wrapper   PS  always try Small amount  Dust amount  for testing  just to make sure everything is working fine  Imgur  https   imgur com Z147woR Exciting times Sent a SOL tip over to you  Keep up the good work Aah ok thanks   Yeah my initial look a few weeks back proved unfruitful   Guess I ll have to keep my eyes out for any solutions out there It may be a lost cause   All I can find right now is a project that has to be running while you are using the DEX which records and produces the results live   Project serum keeps no records of the trades that occur and it is a mess trying to decipher whatever the blockchain is trying to say about the trades Thanks for the feedback    Will definitely work on it Looks great  I will definitely replace my guestimates for transfers using your source  What I really need though is the project serum DEX trades using that address  It just shows transfers right now I m sorry you re insulted by the fact that r solana is full of people that are biased towards Solana  Not my problem  though  and it s definitely not untrue Negatives of solana    Bad actors had to be manually  slashed  https   www reddit com r solana comments lyu8fi wait_theres_no_slashing_right_now  utm_source share amp utm_medium web2x amp context 3    No on chain governance   token distribution is questionable  already mentioned  i believe    substantial hardware requirements to run a node It s centralized but people on here ignore that fact because they see  OMG OVER 50k  TPS  and it fills up their moonboy energy meters I was looking for one of the accounts to match my original address but did not see it   ill check out the discord and telegrams thank you for linking it not sure how i would go about that That s absolutely untrue and kind of insulting to everyone who asks good questions on the subreddit and everyone who answers them   I mean  just look at the dozens of comments in this topic surrounding your own post Exodus stakes only to Everstake validator  which is bad for the network  since Everstake is already oversized  and has mediocre returns   That would be the reason not to stake using Exodus   But then you have to decide for yourself if the convenience factor overrides those concerns Got it  thank you

whatever you like   amp  post your problem there gt From there I can swap half of my SOL for RAY on Radium    WIll this incur eth gas fees  No it won t  it uses SOL as Gas Fees  Transaction Fees  gt I then take my SOL and RAY tokens and add them to the SOLRAY liquidity pool on Raydium  will I then get the SOLRAY LP tokens    Are these the same token I can then deposit into the corresponding Solfarm vault   If SolFarm is supporting Raydium LPs  then yeah you may do that  but i won t do that unless i double check with SolFarm first  just to be 100  sure  gt Im also slightly confused why Raydium is an erc20 token if its working on the solana blockchain RAY ERC20 works on the Ethereum blockchain  it s has it s equivalent as native RAY  SPL version  that works on Solana blockchain  gt Will the fees here be just as high as on ethereum RAY ERC20 doesn t work on Solana blockchain  you ll have to SWAP it to RAY SPL using sollet through wormhole bridge  which will cost you ETH Gas Fees since you ll be sending a transaction of RAY ERC20 from Ethereum to Solana blockchain to get your RAY SPL  or simply buy the RAY SPL from any Solana Dex or from FTX  amp  send it to any wallet   DEX supporting Solana Thank you my man Have u tried accessing through a different wallet You can add other chains by adding a custom RPC  but I learned while researching solana wallets that you can only add chains which are forks of Ethereum onto metamask Thank you For some reason i dont think you re joking  It gets hot down there in hell buddy  Lmao Just 20  Should add another zero to that bro  I just did this afternoon with high hopes for a good 50  gain in 15 ish days or less which After all the spikes we have had this weekend like icp celo and others had 50 to 70  jumps  I was able to get in on celo when it shot up Saturday  40  gain less than 8 hours Contact them and ask about it  They have good customer service If you re interested in the trilemma  you should take a look at Algorand  which is the only blockchain that truely solves it I thought MetaMask was ethereum only Anyone know any SOL whales I can watch Just banging some heroin and cheating on my wife and thinking this is cool and good

is something that you should expect to do regularly in your career Exodus only stakes with Everstake though and is bad for the network because Everstake is oversized   Any staking solution that does not let you explicitly pick validators is a poor choice in my opinion Moonlet validator pays out substantially less than that    7 27  APY over the past month   Everstake is 7 04  APY   Source   https   stakeview app Hi please read this  I looked at all the other comments and nobody was explicit with this information Ledger DOES support Solana  It s just not supported in Solana Live  You can still use Ledger to manage your secret keys  stake  and secure your tokens offline Phantom and Solflare are integrated with hardware wallets and can provide you with the ability to manage your Solana without ever handing over secrets to those apps  They can see the public keys provided by the ledger but not the secret keys  Just install and open the Solana app on your ledger and then connect Solflare or Phantom to it and your all set Exodus only gives you 6 77  APY though   Moonlet gives you 11 62  APY I think it s fine  You just don t get to pick your validator  I was able to get some free SAMO by staking with GenesysGo   their APR is good I ve been using Exodus for storing my crypto staking SOL and i ve recommended it to people but is there somethin no bueno about Exodus  I havent had issues but honestly if theres something better im all for it I m working on a hobby site to do this at https   stake tax     As an incentive  I do actively work on transactions that do not display comprehensively I tried out Solflare and found it to be just ok  Not too easy to navigate and really doesn t give you too much info when staking i e  if its even in there or when it ll be active etc  Apparently quite a few people have issues with missing coins  or what appears to be missing coins   or getting their funds stolen  Don t quote me on the last one  but i do believe i read a post about that recently  No FUD here  been holding SOL for a minute and really don t like any other crypto nearly as much  Just currently think Solflare needs A LOT of work  That being said  SOL is GOAT  I have had good luck with Exodus  they constantly update and customer support is on point I ve tried Solflare and a couple other wallets and as far as ease of use and staking I personally like Exodus the best  Don t think it has ledger support for SOL  yet  but they update like crazy  They re constantly updating the supported coins and other features  Theres a mobile and desktop version   human  support is really quick to respond and they actually help  Just mah 2 cents I ve used cointracking a couple years and have found it good for my situation  Its UI for debugging and fixing transactions

your opinion what is the best way to buy SOL  and then swap for RAY  And on Solfarm the SOL RAY LP is the biggest and most liquid  This is money I m perfectly fine with losing  I ve decided to take a small chunk and go all in on yield farming with it  My goal is to just explore defi projects on other chains to eventually see what is safest and most secure  but also earn a good yield  I realize I will be taking on a lot of risk before I find that out
2021-06-29,33.00978597,35.78857772,32.72668303,Thank you and yes  There are tons of great up and coming defi projects  I think someone made a post about the hackathon winners a couple days ago  As for now  the most utilized farming site is raydium io  I think it feels really good  has a lot of great pairs  big volume  and high APR s Great write up    and after a little hesitation I setup a Solflare wallet and had my SOL staked within a few minutes  It s actually easier than it sounds   Any good options for liquidity farming defi with SOL Yeah I ve split my SOL 50 50 in exodus and solflare just in case one goes to hell for some reason lol  Exodus is HORRIBLE if you re swapping tokens  Like it s super bad they charge a fortune How so  I m a noob too  What s better than exodus for hodling SOL yes but what makes you think the bad guy will get it first and not Google or Apple  If bad guys were that advanced they would not need to do bad things and they would be superior to the good guys by nature  China cant even get what requires creativity before America today  and they have more resources than the US does and can build a tower or ship or factory way faster than the US can You must be illiterate or something  brother  I thanked him multiple times for the info and said I appreciated it  I guess you can t read or simply skipped over those parts  My skin is thick enough  I simply think that he went about the dialogue like a cunt  I m less worried about my feelings being hurt and more concerned with fostering a better community for the space  Once again  there are a few stake pools with higher yields than Exodus but the improvements are relatively negligible  None of them are  considerably better  but go off lol   Considering this info is a Google search away  you must not frequent the internet  You re welcome for the free info Yeah I think you are highlighting how badly we need better staking solutions   Exodus is the easiest but the worst for its users in every way except convenience   Then we have solflare which is much better for end users and for Solana but I ve heard similar complaints about its usability support    I am not sure how moonlet io compares I really need to give each of these staking solutions an actual try so that I can formulate a more informed opinion   That s on me That is very far from true No offense  but you re going to have to grow a thicker skin if you are going to use the internet frequently   The person you replied to simply factually stated what was wrong with your original post   It is free education that will help you be a better investor  you should be appreciative   Also there is some evidence that many of those eth nodes are all really the same much smaller set of people running multiple nodes each   Not sure if this is true  but the whole issue is very complicated and accurate comparisons are not easy But it s not good for your wallet  relative to other staking options  that pay considerably better APY than Everstake Well your question doesn t make a lot of sense   But I ll try to answer it   If you look at https   stakeview app you will see what is paid to  stake accounts    What is paid to the validator is already removed from the returns that are used to calculate APY Like if you have an investment account and you have  1 000 in it and your investment grows 10  over the year and your broker s commission is 5   then you will actually have a return of 9 5    You get  95 and your broker gets  5   That s how APY works Solana validation   same concept So what s the net net staking percentage u got after commission for the is validator  Haha I use Moonlet app on iOS  Pretty comfortable  It s just that when you want to add to your balance  you need to create a new staking account within the app  Other than that I am using FTX  but it s unstaking a whole week Exodus by far the easiest  Solflare has literally 0 customer service so if something goes wrong you re on your own  I thought I lost some of my SOL for a day as my staked SOL wasn t appearing  I tried to send them an email and their form rejected it lol  Then I tried hitting them up on Twitter and they wouldn t allowed DMs  But it finally worked so I guess it s ok  lol I like Moonlet The problem with solflare for me the keystore file  I don t trust myself enough to expose an unencrypted key file to my system   A simple seed phrase method from them would be really appreciated my me Where is the proof of 50k tps  cant find in anywhere I got 10 solana but I want to get to 1000  steady and slowly will get to 100  I ve been an investor since 2017 and I ll tell you  the price ain t gonna jump drastically for a year  Ytd it ll be around 50 60You re just investing into the next bullrun  in 3 years  Once that hits  sol is going to 1500 easy and if you have 1000  that s over 1 mil but even 100 will get you enough for a home  Waiting for 3 years is waiting but with staking available   you ll have around 200 from that 100 staked in the same time so you re right in time for bull season Alerts with good alarm sound Dip and dash solflare works really well for me I ll just block you instead  Feel free to do the same to me SolFarm pretty much Solfarm and Solyard Nice you can only lose money on Coinbase I bought at  4   sold at  10 bahahahah That is definitely the most powerful way to stake   But it is very complex and the best solution is excellent documentation  so thanks for that I have spoken to a few people who are trying to create new wallets and staking solutions  and as far as I can tell  they all understand both the importance of  and the competitive advantage of  offering the ability to choose validators so my hopes are high I personally think it s reasonable to either outright require staking like 10  with the app creator  or maybe just having a strong warning and  are you sure  button that comes up if you try to stake less than that  depending on how aggressive the author wants to be   The authors of these things need to be paid so ensuring a small cut for themselves seems reasonable to me  while still allowing the bulk  90   of delegation to be at the staker s whims Uphold announced in March that they would have staking for Solana  and a few others  in June  Still waiting   they ve got a day left to deliver on their promise  Doubtful they will  Someone mentioned Solana staking on Kraken  That is not available at this time  It s only a matter of time before there are more options What s so great ab step tho  Like why r u shilling it lol Solarians is the original idea nft on solana  Just minting them is expensive already though I ve been using moonlet for a bit  Pretty good app Okey ty crypto guru billionare There is many other famous coins with same stary so idk pretty normal I m with you 100   I ll endorse solflare in the future  it s what I currently use anyway gt  It s a problem with the consumerNo it s not Yes   It does This more like 7 2x  but I like it  Can Download the Moonlet app on the phone and Use my Nano X with it I use Moonlet   easy  non custodial staking given the SOL is on my ledger h w wallet and a very good APY too I stake on the CLI   I wrote this tutorial  http   solanadata com how to stake html current price  0 286156 Lmao  I bought step at  2 and sold at  4  I laughed so hard when I saw the current price maybe but we should advise that option to force em to swim Sigh  I tried  Good luck Steps tokenomics are crazy  So many tokens being issued per week Yes that is an option too  but I wouldn t really advise it to anyone that isn t very comfortable with computers  I wouldn t even trust myself to not mess that one up lol I dont think so Thanks for this post  very well summarized  Only thing I would add is staking through the CLI  although I understand this is very cumbersome compared to the other options listed Holding my alien till the invasion Bruh  they re busting their ass working on the marketplace  No point in spending time on marketing at this time  Once the marketplace is up  and users start trading  it will be time for marketing    The mods also respond extremely fast to any requests that have to do with technical issues  so I don t know what you re smoking  Sounds like a lot of butt hurt for no reason Yeah just generates a unique SOL address like you would need to send between CB and Kraken Is SolFlare working  I tried to create a wallet there yesterday and got as far as selecting a derivation path but then it would not populate addresses for me to choose from Step is an actual ponzi Is transferring to a software wallet like Exodus as easy as transferring an asset from one exchange wallet to another ie  Say form Coinbase pro over to Kraken Moonlet looks good  I haven t used it  but it has a high APR Seems like Exodus has best APY simplicity Yeah   I m stoked about that  I ve bought some on there the past few weeks  however no staking  I ve used Binance US to buy SOL  amp  VET since January  although they also don t offer on platform staking for SOL Awesome thanks Yes it s a browser extension Is Solflare web only  I don t see it in Google Play Thank you  I have had a look at the Mango markets  Have you heard of Marinade finance Ahh thanks for letting me know  Still  it s a really helpful site so thank you for making it Yeah didn t know they did  That s fair though Thank you  My only issue with the influx of new wallets is that they are all trying to make a profit  Solflare is at least to my knowledge community created  which is why it doesn t promote any validators  but also why it s UI isn t amazing  New wallets that support sol staking like Atomic claim to offer validator choices  but they are only  approved validators   which means you can choose between two that both pay fees to Atomic  Hopefully that changes soon as well Hm I take it you are surprised to learn that they raised their commission I hope everyone understands that validators can change their commission at any time  although changes are not common  I d say maybe 5 out of 600 change their commission in any given epoch Chainode Tech at 7  commission is still ranked  16 out of all Solana validators for returns   They are still a great choice  I wouldn t de stake just because they raised commission so that they can actually afford to pay for their validator you can get SOL on Coinbase in the US Excellent summary  and it does answer questions that are asked frequently here so thanks for that I agree with your assessment that more staking wallets apps are going to be coming online  I suspect that within the next couple of months we are going to see an explosion of them  and solflare is no longer going to be the only game in town Incorrect   https   stakeview appEven if you just stake 100  with Dokia  who runs Solflare   you will get 7 23  returns versus Everstake Exodus at 7 01    But the icing on the cake is that Solflare actually lets you pick validators instead of locking you into just one with Exodus Stop  The  Madness  Some time from now people will look at this and find it ridiculous  Some already do WHAT Totally understand that  and ik where you re coming from   Exodus just might be a more plausible option to those not well versed in staking via more advanced methods  such as delegating directly to validators Sweet    I ve met my quota for the day of being helpful      Glad it worked out and cheers to making money while you sleep  ️ Exactly  and Solana actually has decentralization advantages over other PoS projects imo  With PoH  the network can keep growing and becoming more decentralized without slowing it down  With other PoS chains that rely on sharding for scalability  that isn t the case  They will become more centralized as they grow because they can t keep increasing the   of validators on the L1 network validating every transaction without slowing it down I m not saying that Solana gets all the decentralization tradeoffs 100  perfect  but I think PoH s implications for decentralization certainly seem to be underappreciated Well that was completely painless for a Ledger Nano X  Thanks Don t use Exodus  it hurts decentralization No you can t  but you can use solflare  where you own the keys and therefore you own the crypto That s a great link  thanks Awesome   Have fun A quick google search led me to a guide they produced to do it  I m in business Wish I could be more help My interest is piqued  I ll play with it and see That I don t know know   ZIL  SOL  and NEAR are currently available for staking   You can also store ETH based projects in specific wallets  but no staking yet on those Does Moonlet work with Ledger  I vaguely recall hearing it does No  but Moonlet allows you to stake   I believe it s 11 62 Chainode Tech is a legit 0  fee validator I don t believe so  check out Exodus if you re keen on staking This  https   stakeview app  is a user made site that gives the real returns of every validator  You can see that everstake  the validator that exodus stakes through  is in 450 694  So if you go on solflare  you can choose to stake with a better performing validator But apr is lower than exodus tho Exodus apr seems better than solfare Look at the recent news reports   But regardless if anything happens or not If you leave on exchanges it s not your crypto This is wrong on multiple fronts  First of all  everstake performs in the middle of the pack among sol validators  Being able to choose who you stake with on solflare actually would give you a higher apr  As to decentralization  there are 700 validators and counting  That is definitely on the path to what most would consider good enough decentralization  Staking on a top 3 validator just because it s 5 seconds faster than picking your own  is not a knock against Solana and it s decentralization  it s a problem with the consumer  PoS has the potential to be just as distributed as any other mechanism You have to research which validators have the lowest fees  I think someone posted a few days ago which validators have been the most profitable lately Solflare is best Kraken will eventually support buying and staking  If you like simplicity  go with Exodus  I use them too  I trust Kraken as an exchange  so to de risk  I d keep 50  in Exodus and 50  in Kraken Why do you say that about Binance  A good proportion of my crypto is parked there  ok  don t think anything huge   You made me worried No  all sales right now are using SOL OTC using discord middleman  Marketplace is in the works and should be an update today  From preview pictures marketplace will be denominated in SOL Aren t they denominated in ETH No  I think you re reading into the video a little too much  SolPunks are related to Solana as they are made on the Solana ecosystem I m in the US and just use Exodus yeah some with 2   and lots of smaller holders staking there So some minority dude with 1 hand rides a whale in the sky with the heads of men he has slain with his cringe is related to solana I disagree  proof of stake can be very decentralized  Solana just needs to increase the number of nodes that make up the top 33  of total stake delegated  Wallets like exodus don t help with this problem  I understand it s user friendly  There are nodes that will give you better returns than everstake though I use Exodus  Happy with it How do you mean  mods have changed Atomic wallet has staking too Still accumulating positions   in future Binance is in troubled waters  Better to mee ur crypto in wallets then in exchanges There exists low fee validators Maybe so but I like that I hold the keys to my Sol and this works   I hope you find a good place to store and earn I hear Kraken now has SOL staking  but I wouldn t really know because I m American  amp  can t buy or stake SOL on their exchange  All these miss matched regulations are freaking ridiculous   Crypto needs some damn uniformity I am staking on Binance at 9 20  APY Bad for decentralization but good for my wallet  If you have an issue with decentralization  perhaps PoS isn t right for you  Solana s decentralization issues are well beyond 1 wallet using a popular validation The commission is pretty high to validators too Exodus wallet stakes directly to everstake  who is already in the top 3 validators  This is bad for decentralization of the network Heard bout it too but just asking the community if there are other recommendations too before I do the switch too Shit  3000  more like 30 000  The community is trying to build it into something and the devs have been somewhat responsive  Hope to have an open channel with them soon I use the Exodus wallet  May not be the highest apr i m not sure but it s extremely easy to use Are there any exchanges like Celsius that do this for US based hodlers SolFlare is nice   My only gripe was I couldn t figure out how to add to my stake so I ended it  consolidated it and restarted   Wasn t a big deal  but it took a day or so I bought one of the first 500 sold and was prepared to buy more   But no confidence in the devs other than it being a bit of a cash grab   no marketing budget  a few have asked for this in discord but the question has not even been acknowledged   I bought on the 2nd day of release  There was a mint bot in discord and I was following sales  Sales were ticking over nicely  but then all of a sudden 5k sold in 24 hours  The mint bot dissapreared of discord and despite users asking for its return  nothing  Highly suspicious that the devs shifted 5000 in 24 hours   lots of sellers constantly posting in all channels in the discord trying to sell  Most of them owning 20 30 punks and asking too high prices for them  No you cant compare prices to the original sol punks  This means small concentration of owners trying to keep prices high  It s not working  tbh I m suprised I sold mine for 9sol  Price is drifting down as you can tell the devs are not interested in building a good community  If you want to see a great community for punks look to cryptobabies   cryptobabypunks on twitter   This project can be turned around but the devs who raked in 3000 sol   102k USD  need to spend some of that cash on marketing and generally being more active  IF they re busy building more then pay someone in the interim  Mods have changed since the start which shows they re not happy with something There was also the first ever collab of Satoshi street bets   that was hella unique It can also be unwrapped in Step FInance They don t own one They already are bruh  these sold out This experience was amazing  stop fudding Yeah these are just cringe and never going to hold value compared to the original What is horrible this is horrible Must have not seen much then DYOR Not too late to grab one Who cares Glasses need to be pitvipers Where can you buy it you should do more research lol Solarium messaging app looks interesting Thank you  that is very kind   I ll do my best to keep earning the best rewards in Solana for you Hi sorry I didn t see your question before There is now a page that describes how the values are computed https   www stakeview app help htmlLook at the section titled  Is the data provided here accurate  Also  But my favorite validator reports returns of 10 3  on their website  and StakeView app reports 7 21   Which is correct  In short   stakeview app is accurate  and advertising or promises on other web sites are not  and you can verify this using the techniques described on that help page if you like Why does every chain think they need their own version of Punks  Can we stop trying to imitate the success of other chains and do something unique You can only stake sol  but you can use mango and lend btc and eth  You can also stake certain spl tokens but it depends on the token  For exampale you can stake serum  and slim A fun way to DCA  D Fomo queen i love it xD Ftx will automatically send the correct version of usdc based on wallet adress  It treats all  usd stable coin  the same  but when you click withdraw you just have to put in an spl usdc adress and it works great   So basically when you deposit usd or trade something else  into it you get  usd stable coin  and you can withdraw it that in like 4 different forms including spl usdc and it just sends the correct one based on wallet adress  Really slick  it s not that simple on other exchanges I m just not used to usdc in separate chains  how are you buying usdc spl on fox  I m just going with SOL so I know my coin is on the proper chain I know i m a bit late here but this advice is amazing   Thanks Xxx xxx x   X x   I ll  Xxx needs substantial hardware requirements to run a nodeThis is a feature not a bug  It makes it fasts and makes it so kids who think  5k is a lot for computer hardware go and poison other networks with the home networked macbooks Thats a perfect way to do it ftx us is the best onramp for Solana defi and you have to have sol in your wallet anyway   I usually send usdc from ftx us to my Phantom So here s what I ve actually ended up doing  I m using phantom wallet to manage SOL on my ledger  I will be funding my SOL wallet from ftx us  and then take your advice and trade that SOL for both RAY  TULIP   and USDC  I will then provide liquidity for solray and TULIPUSDC pools and then stake the corresponding LP tokens on solfarm Click the trading tab on raydium io  Buy sol and ray with usdc  If you would rather swap use the swap tab but you ll get a better rate if you trade on the trading tab which is the serum clob nice i wish solana have nice desktop wallet with staking calculate how much is the current apy  i like browser extension wallet for use in defi but for larger amounts would like desktop or hope that ledger wallet will add solana to ledger live
2021-06-30,33.96297243,35.95472226,31.60135067,Well technically a token doesn t really transfer to someone  Their balance in the token contract changed  You might need to escalate it to someone who understands cryptos better if it s doable I ve just heard about it  Do you think it is safe Commie China sol summer go to solflare and connect your ledger and get a deposit address   This will let you know if you are going to have issues with your browser or not   If it connects and you can generate an deposit address then send the Minimum amount you are allowed to withdraw from FTX to that address   Wait for it to arrive and when it does then send the rest of your SOL   Then proceed to stake on the validator of your choice For solflare all you have to do is download the Solana app on your ledger and link it to SolFlare  You should see a address at the top that you can send your SOL to  Make sure to send a test amount first tho Just looked into it  Awesome project People are starting to realize what solana really means can anyone explain to me what wrapped SOL is which sol wallet do you use exactly  and they always boom on reddit so nice to add those in for perspective Any know of a good resource that explains the things you need to understand in order to understand what s junk and what s not He said Top 20 Meme  Aka Meme coins are growing next to some of the big players in community I don t know much about NFTs   What am I looking at and why is it a reddit post   Honest question It s still pretty sad to see shib in this list Meme coins  The only meme coins I see on this list are doge and shiba Most youtubers that talk about crypto and or day trading are modern day con artists that have little to no expertise or accountability  Most make money from being online personalities  views  likes  subscribers  not from crypto investing and or day trading  There are some videos talking about Wyckoff method applied to trading crypto with most not applying key basic concepts of the method  It s an absolute joke There was a lot more leverage in the may 19 crash  Since then it has fallen off a lot Its tokenomics are designed to go to 0  Like its coded that way  Its a farm token i am having same problem on solape swap while sttling sol in sollet  any solution I prefer raydium   not the autocounding but u can harvest and stakebthem for 20  apr have you got solution I am currently having this issue from past 5 days on Solape dex  any solution All these ido s are cash grabs Very good read about validators and staking  thank you Can you explain Very curious to hear what those are You d have to add up a lot of different sources of it on each network  aave  compound  etc   then factor in leverage from other networks that hold wrapped versions of your native token  then factor in leverage from CEXs  and then deal with futures  which would be tough It s easier to just follow the flow of tether   usdc  since most leverage is issued via them Also wondered this recently  There are other indicators for market tops though if that s what you re looking to understand Yeah  I am as well  I just thought I would ask as your question was the same as mine At this point  I can t remember   But I got out as I believe that my money is better invested in staking straight SOL   I am bullish My opinion is governance is a must for every project  The questionable element is how investors value governance and how its distributed    I think one of the main element of crypto is about leveling up the decentralization of decision taking process and that is easier and measurable through token that can be used  partly or completely as a mean to vote  Otherwise  open source can be hijacked and centralized    Now there are definitely some project that are not trustworthy by looking at the distribution of the governance tokens and that are still decentralized without governance token  but I think having a governance token is better for the reasons mentioned Garbage I saw this post and was wondering what happened when you pulled the LP tokens out  The way they have these pools set up is awful as you can t tell if anything is going up or down Couldn t agree more What s their APY I personally prefer projects which extract their returns as transaction fees on their services   This to me is a vote of confidence in their own application   they are going to profit if their app is a success Projects that create tokens without any need to  and typically justify it with vague  governance token  reasoning  suggest to me that they are just hoping for a quick cash grab on an ICO   That doesn t inspire confidence in the long term viability of the project Of course it s always possible that they re just being strategic  creating a coin to cash in on hype with the intention of re investing the hype fueled gains in the success of the project instead of lining their pockets   I realize that s a possibility   It just always feels like the less likely case to me That s just my opinion  obviously Stake on ftx  its 10 No lol  Raydium is a good token except for its tokenomics causing inflation but I think they r changing that  Raydium actually has an insanely useful and necessary platform unlike step which is just another dashboard Ya but this dude is hyping up a dashboard  There s nothing too special ab it No  you can choose any amount  up to the 100  of SOL that you have in your non staking wallet  The program will take care of ensuring you have enough to cover rent How bad is it Yes they re really really bad  Ruining Binance s image Binance Which exchange Got Binance s Support reply after they Re checked all things  When I check your deposit   it seems that sent with SOL network Deposit listed token via wrong network to Binance  Currently only the deposit via HT can be retrieved  Other networks currently do not support recovery That s not staking though  to be clear   Although I feel that trying to fight a nomenclature war at this point is probably a lost cause so I should just give up Only Binance able to help you out  I have no idea what   technical   stuff might be involved into this  but since they are the owner of that SOL wallet  no one else will be able to help in this matter  So sorry for your loss Just be polite with them  15 SOL is real money and it s yours  Look at my interaction with FTX   https   ibb co n7FjnkG  https   ibb co n7FjnkG   That was enough to get my fat 0 07 SOL credited 6rCFoACqbQwVSS2o2Mes6365JJqmuJBBNP34VyxBB8Gh This is my Binance s Sol Address And wrapped sols

stake over several validators Naw its actually legit Yeaah well lets see what future brings You re gonna be poor  lol Solflare Only Binance side can help https   explorer solana com tx 4nhVsHEBexe8oFAS3wQXZ2MMEP2nhEQ8gPSEfmP5QYkhTiKvCCFvMpeYzZEHw2LnGKtdMem7Dfx87paTcrQGmJMrTxid attached Note for Solflare  but also for some wallets   you can  use your ledger if you have one  instead of the keystore file  It s easier and probably more secure  I guess   Makes going to solflare even easier I already contacted them they are saying that they didn t received any funds Binance support  but probably not Scam is kind of subjective though  Don t know that much about the step so can t comment but noticed they have a big apy   which means they will be minting like crazy so thats one thing   but if the fundamentals on what they are doing is good then go for it  I personally like raydium  you can add liquidity   farming and then staking easily So u can stack up the yield like   1   add liquidity in sol   ray pool   give 2 5 2  Yield farming of LP token   give 48 3  Stake the harvested ray token   20  So good return  this ensures loyalty for pool and good holding rate Watch out kiddos will say its scam or shit or magic trick coin  ‍ ️   they are buying Doge and think it will go to 100  in next 3 years Thoughts on Ray token   raydium native token Idk and idc Cool story boy Do I Well you let banks hold your moneys so hmm yeah legit They include ref link always so these babys dont want that  idk why     If they dont want to share it why it need to mean that no1 cant Exodus Honestly  I personally don t see it going too crazy because I think Kusama is winning in terms of Parachains  I may reinvest some towards DOT  but I m not positive atm The number one enemy to crypto is illiterate people who have trouble reading and understanding what they read  or lazy people who can t read everything in its entirety Why would the good guys not exploit bitcoin  If it is possible  someone is going to do it and noone should blame them for it  A blockchain should not be built on trust  That is the whole point https   finematics com liquidity pools explained  this link is ok  it doesn t go into impermanent loss though so make sure you look up how that works as well Don t let anyone hold your crypto for you Why is the content of the majority of your posts deleted then No need  they have permissionless pools now So  before this step    Tell your wallet to create a stake account and fund it fully with 10 SOL   Do you  need to have 10 SOL in your non staking wallet   Just want to make sure I understand it correclty Source  trust me bro Bro the apy for Step was 720 755 96   if you dont understand what that means well then anything I say will be lost on you  If you cant do your own research  maybe dont invest in fringe alt coins i see a lot of complaints in Coinbase sub Ya it s great trip they lose 100  of your coins  The the 10  isn t  so good Here s an article on how to do it  https   raydium gitbook io raydium permissionless creating a pool Nah just awesome exchange   month ago they had event where you can buy half price uniswap Contact with support of raydium i think they can help u Smell like scam spirit Im staking ok Kraken or is that a mistake   I know not your keys not your crypto but it s a rather small position   Just wanna now about the yield Why did you give up on dot Is anyone planning on beta testing Steaking io Steaking io looks to be a good platform but it s not expected to launch until mid July Yea only disadvantage is that it takes a weekTo unstake where you don t earn   I like that it s paid hourly and easy to add the accrued interest to the capital I do use solfarm  thoughts on solyard  Not as official and clunky to use Ive never done staking but I keep my SOL at Binance  US    I m not seeing SOL when I go to the Staking link  Is it still available  Or maybe only available outside the US Apologies for the noob question  just trying to learn FTX pays 10 FTX Pro let s you stake 10  APY  I think they even give you more if you stake atleast 25 FTT too Slide in my DMs if yiu want a referal code for cheaper fees Checkout the Figment Solana Learning Pathway https   learn figment io network documentation solana solana pathway  https   learn figment io network documentation solana solana pathway They ll pay you a little SOL just start learning about blockchain development on Solana I think their app is great  That s about it for me  Lol You didn t try very hard  You need to go in depth about how something is a ponzi scheme I m pretty dumb and I figured it out  It s not hard  God complex  Wut I switched from Solflare to Moonlet  Solflare felt too cumbersome to use Moonlet is not a yield farm  it s just a wallet app I Am Using Sollet Wallet  is there any Platform where i can stake using sollet Thank you  If you have any quality links handy I d be appreciative  Hard to wade through the BS Someone has a God complex Damn u sold at the top of the squeeze  Respect So liquidity farming doesn t technically give a set apr  basically you make a percentage of transaction fees in the liquidity pool equivalent to your percentage of the pool  So for instance  if the pool has a total supply equal to  100  and  10 is from you  if  10 is extracted through fees  when you pull out of the pool  you will get your initial value plus your percentage of the fees  so  11 total  Of course  the values of the coins fluctuate too  which changes other things  The listed apys are basically bonus incentives for providing liquidity to pools  That wasn t very in depth  so if you are interested  there are a lot of great articles that explain it better than I can Been doing solfarm  Team is anonymous so I only have a very small amount in there You can use Kraken if you US resident except NY and Washington Steps token is shit  but tbh I actually use their app  It s like zapper for solana Can t figure out how to see APY of the different pairs  even using the Radium instructions  but the site does look slick Why should I block you just because we don t agree to something  Life is much better than getting disgruntled over disagreements  Peace Step is a shitcoin Yeah it looks like moonlet is something only for staking solana directly which really doesn t have great returns Thanks for the shout  this is what I was looking for I stake on SolFLare  I find it to be pretty simple to onboard  Especially because of this video I found on youtube   https   www youtube com watch v EAWJ12Y4v _M amp list PLJbgvtIGQHGFKBcVcuAoQ2nje2MQixEFp amp index 5  https   www youtube com watch v EAWJ12Y4v_M amp list PLJbgvtIGQHGFKBcVcuAoQ2nje2MQixEFp amp index 5   Note  The guy in the video uses a ledger nano  but the walk through will still help you understand the process if you are not using a ledger nano exodus is trash  find somewhere else to stake if you can  get a hardware wallet if you need to also That doesn t read like very thick skin  brother    But whatever   You be you  I m done here Solfarm is where I m auto compounding my RAY why you say so  I mostly use Coinbase
2021-07-01,35.50565339,35.53819144,32.38627423,Watching him play feels like so distant memory    wild times I use Firefox and it works today  chrome doesn t for me But what does it even mean to have a DEX on SHIB  Or where is the value of creating other shittokens  That I don t understand actually  Isn t it going to be just another ETH DEX  I remember SHIB being  doge killer  then out of the blue it became  charity token   and now it s a DEX  They are not giving it a direction  they are just keeping this scam alive as much as possible to lure more people into it In my opinion  this kind of tokens just make the investing environment significantly worse for everyone  So I don t and I think won t have respect for this kind of stuff But  whatever floats your boat Did you get any information

Is Radium the closest thing on Solana You can type your public key into this site  https   app step finance   dashboardYou can send it to any Solana address  You will be able to use with any Solana dapps that recognize it which is only Raydium and orca to my knowledge  Basically it s only use case is holding and trading Thank you so much for the response  definitely helps me understand some things One more follow up question if you don t mind  Let s assume I have completed the swap for some FTT   since the Solana ecosystem is not compatible with Ledger Live   how do I view interact with this newly acquired FTT in my solana account on my ledger device Would I be able to send this wrapped FTT anywhere else  or access it if I connected my ledger device to an exchange other than Raydium Serum I use Atomic Wallet  get about 7  yield  Same decentralization issues as mentioned  but for those intimidated by Solflare it s another option can you talk about  slashing  and the possibilities of losing your stake  ive been reading the docs and came across it  and it worries me a lil bit It representa a new and popular bigger fool scheme  so at least it got that going for it The reason people say they lost all their money because they lost their ledger is because they have lost the private key that proves they own the account  It is virtually impossible to guess a private key so if you lose it or forget it  there s nothing you can do  The ledger is just remembering the private key for you Don t do that  very risky You could lose your Sol Yes it will be on your ledger device  It s important to understand what a ledger is though  You are not literally storing your tokens on it  Instead you have a Solana account which is your public key  the public key that you send tokens to  and you have a private key  which is just a random sequence of letters and numbers  that is used to perform actions with that account  the private key proves that you own the account   All the ledger is doing is storing that private key for your solana account  It just stores the private key very securely since if someone has your private key they can do whatever they want to any funds linked to your account  When you perform a transaction with your solana account  the blockchain keeps the record of the transaction so it is actually the blockchain itself that keeps track of what tokens you own  not the ledger  The ledger interface may not be able to understand all the tokens that you have in your solana account but you still own them  A ledger is useful for storing a bunch of private keys for many different networks like Solana  Ethereum and Bitcoin for example Hope that makes sense orca so  https   www orca so pools  is higher  RAY SOL pool  180  based on 24 hours  110   based on 7 days  42  based on 30 days Thanks for letting us know  I shall cover the process in a new guide Would you risk your account FTX can just freeze your account if they detect you are using a VPN Thanks for appreciation This is awesome  Thanks for making it It s worth pointing out that you can stake SOL with a Ledger Nano X on the Moonlet wallet  I found that process to be much easier than SolFlare Thanks so much for the detailed response  So the only way to figure out my solana public address on my ledger is by connecting it to another wallet like Solflare Once I have the public address  and I am ready to go to my FTX US wallet and withdraw my SOL  does Solflare have anything to do with that process  or was the sole purpose of Solflare to identity my public address on my ledger device Thanks a bunch for this info  So once I make this swap  will that wrapped FTT be on my Ledger device  I m not sure how to think about that part   it appears ledger live supports FTT  but idk about how I would store wrapped FTT on it depends whick token you choose  just look at the vaults on the website   https   solfarm io vaults   https   solfarm io vaults    API is swinging a lot Yeah you can stake them where ever you want   Solfalre is just a third party app Website  that when combined with the Ledger  lets you interact with Sols blockchain   Any of them will work  some have more features and different graphics   Its probably just the most popular   To answer your 1st question    yeah a wallet interface has to be involved somehow   I dont think you can generate a deposit address with just a Ledger   Again the CLI tools are need in combination with Ledger   not just Ledger alone The pool fees are coming from the trading volume  When you swap trade in the RAY SOL pool you pay a   fee  A part of this fee goes to Raydium and rest goes back to the pool owned by the liquidity providers  This is the fee you see estimated in the 1y Fees   Liquidity column  So the fees gains depend on how much trading volume takes place in a pool  You can see trading volume for the last 24 hours and the fees as well  Why the gains much higher on uniswap for WBTC   WETH pair It s a more popular pair market and the trading volume is much higher   gt  higher fees  Or in other words fewer people trade the RAY   SOL pair on Raydium hence the lower gains and not necessarily a difference between Raydium and Uniswap This fee percentage is estimated based on recent trading volume and prices But this is only the liquidity provider fee and doesn t include the farming yield  extra incentive for liquidity providers given by the raydium AMMs  which you can see in the farming tab and I used Raydium to swap usdc to wrapped FTT  I believe we can only buy wrapped FTT coins in the US Yes you can use Serum  actually Raydium io which uses Serum under the hood  by either using Raydium Swap or Raydium DEX to purchase FTT with USDC or USDT  I recommend USDC as the liquidity pool is larger   I use Sollet to do this  I ve never used a ledger but I believe you can use a ledger with Raydium as well  So you could move USDC to your ledger and then go to Raydium and connect your ledger to it by clicking connect in the top right corner  Once your ledger is connected to Raydium you will be able to use the USDC on it to swap for FTT or trade it for FTT on the DEX by placing a limit order  If you re buying a small amount  I recommend using swap since it s easier but you ll probably lose like 0 5  on the swap due to slightly worse conversion  But Raydium DEX has a bit of a learning curve Also make sure that the USDC on your ledger is SPL based and not ERC20 as Raydium only works with SPL tokens  Also the FTT that you buy is SPL wrapped FTT and not  real  FTT but the price mirrors actual FTT Thanks for your reply  The 1 year fee for RAY SOL is around 3    On Uniswap the 1   fee for WBTC WETH is around 30    https   raydium io pools   https   raydium io pools   https   uniswapv3 flipsidecrypto com  https   uniswapv3 flipsidecrypto com   So the gains on Uniswap are much higher  Or is there something I m missing on the pool page the last column says  1y fees liquidity  which is an APR estimation  The APR isn t fixed but determined by how much it is used  You get a portion of the fees  so the higher the volume divided by total liquidity  the more APR you get everything is pegged to bitcoin  stop falling in love with shitcoins Sending from FTX to your Ledger is easy  Here is the process  not financial advice  I disclaim any legal liability for any mistakes in what follows  rely on at your own risk and do your own research  etc    First  make sure you ve downloaded the Solana Ledger app onto your Ledger  through Ledger Live desktop software   Once you have done this  you should see a small Solana logo whenever you turn on your Nano X   Doing so will create a Solana public key for your Ledger  You then need to find out what it is  You can do that by connecting your Ledger to Solflare  but alternatively by connecting it to Moonlet  a good mobile app  Then  click the  withdraw  button in the Solana row on your FTX wallet page  Then  input your Ledger s public key  and send the Solana to it   HIGHLY recommend that you test this out by sending a small amount  e g  0 05 SOL  first  and making sure you receive it on your Ledger  before you send larger amounts I don t want to ruin the party  but shiba is seconda and in this list there are only 3 meme coin Then retrace of 36  at the most  Followed by the final 5th wave and market top   blowout  Then we crash and winter begins Personally on this run I m using Elliot wave theory  You can calculate using golden ratios how big the wave is going to be based on the previous wave  Seems farfetched but when you start to look at the first wave and subsequent retrace it seems obvious  we are about to embark on wave 3  Solana for example should do 1 62 of the initial wave  amazingly almost a Fibonacci sequence up to 58   55 of course would have been perfect  This wave is going to take everyone by surprise by its scale and I can see a top to either 120 or 170 or so depending on whether we do golden ratio 1 61 or 2 61 Solana  amp  Shiba   I Got a big bag of both lol Ah sieet i forgot that Whatever it has  it doesn t change the fact that there is nothing new or special about it Dude  please stop I m using google chrome but it s an older version v87  I have an old Mac OS so it s not letting me update without updating my OS I plan to stake my SOL via Solflare and my Ledger soon   but from what I ve read  certain newer versions of web browsers  for example any version of chrome  gt  v91  broke WebUSB  so now Solflare falls back to U2F  which Ledger recently deprecated on their devices    What browser and version are you on  The Solana discord was super helpful  as they had a Solflare channel   but it got to the point where so many people were having issues they made it read only and pointed people towards Solflare s Telegram lol d to this  spot on  it s a shittier zapper with a token Can you elaborate on lifetime withdrawal limit  On FTX us or on solflare doesn t look like AAX is available in the US I grow my sol bag weekly and add it to my staked amount I don t  sorry  I personally use the keystore files because I feel more comfortable with it  Maybe ask for an update in the post they mentioned it the other day Start using AAX  Awesome welcome bonuses and high savings rates for solana and FTT   10  https   www aaxpro com invite sign up inviteCode MxK0nS9QgLm2 Did they fix this for you  I just made a similar mistake Sadly you need Solflare to stake with a nano x right now  Solflare just gives you an interface to see your account but your private keys stay secure on your nano x which is why you download the Solana app OP do you know if the issues with Solflare having trouble accessing ledger devices on certain web browsers  for example chrome  gt v91  have been resolved thats solid data right there  thanks for sharing this is strictly for staking my SOL  correct  what about just getting the SOL off of the  FTX US  https   FTX US  exchange and sending it to my ledger nano X  maybe take solflare out of the question    is that possible  Will installing solana app on my ledger nano x give me a SOL wallet address to send my SOL directly to from  FTX US  https   FTX US   Or do i   need   to have my ledger nano X connected to a wallet like solflare in order to receive SOL I must be able to right  Just skimming through the Solana docs  and its possible to stake via the CLI tools and my ledger nano X without Solflare  So I assume if I install the Solana app on my ledger nano x  that will provide me with a wallet address that I can use to send my SOL to directly from  FTX US  https   FTX US    sorry if I am not understanding this all correctly Worth pointing out that Ledger Nano X also works with Moonlet just fine and I found it to be much easier to deal with than Solflare  especially staking Thanks for the info  As a follow  lets pretend I have no interest in staking via Solflare   Am I able to send my SOL directly from  FTX US  https   FTX US  to my ledger nano X  Or does a wallet like solflare need to be involved in this equation somehow Hmm interesting point  It says I have Level 2 ID  unlimited

cap of entire crypto market and see if it correlates to any of the corrections  Unfortunately I don t know where this data is haha Shinobi Systems has 0  fees and they are an active member of the community here and on discord  You can use validators app to look at stats I would stake normally with a validator of your choosing on solstake io if you are able just cause when you stake with that service  they take a fee when you withdraw and it looks like all of the sol in the protocol isnt 100  liquid  But it does look very easy to use Watch out for their lifetime withdrawal limit Exactly   6 5  APY ranks them pretty close to the bottom of ALL Solana validators    535 out of 677 where most of the validators below them are 100  commission and pay out nothing Source  https   stakeview app looking at the average of the previous 3 epochs Hey I looked at the list of Solana validators and I found an unnamed one with a  vanity  pubkey that sure looks like it would be Kraken https   solanabeach io validator KRAKEnMdmT4EfM8ykTFH6yLoCd5vNLcQvJwF66Y2dagThey run in AWS Ohio and their performance is pretty bad   I ve been complaining about the poor performing AWS nodes for a while and I guess I can finally put a name to one of them Phantom wallet better imo Gm  today solana is trading like a mini btc but has outperformed it the past couple of days for the 1st time since we entered the bear market Oh nice   Sorry  I do indeed see Phantom as an option to connect   not sure how I missed that earlier   Thanks again Proton vpn is free and works well I use it with bybit I bought bitcoin on Coinsquare and then transferred to Binance  where I bought Sol  Im curious why and how would they lock my account You can choose ledger and do it directly without the phantom intermediate wallet  Or you can choose phantom and every time you do a purchase with your phantom wallet you have to sign it with your ledger  In this case phantom essentially serves as display of the coins in ur wallet Thanks for the reply  So when I go to connect a wallet on the Serum DEX  do I choose Ledger  I didn t see an option for Phantom  The whole hardware wallet combined with the software wallet still confuses me  ha Crypto com has it pretty sure they re running their own validator node  I know on the Cosmos side of things Kraken is listed as one of the validators when you go to stake through your wallet Kraken has actual validator nodes  I remember seeing Kraken exchange in the list of Validators for Cosmos but their staking rewards are 0  if you delated directly towards them through your own wallet  I m pretty sure it s the same for Solana and all the other coins they offer staking for  amp  x200B If you stake though the kraken in house feature on their exchange then they re essentially taking your coins and delegating them towards their own validator node and keeping a cut hence why they only offer 6 5  vs the 11 ish you could be doing if you staked through your own wallet It s still 10 Wait is this official seems kinda low tbh Check out Moonlet wallet You can use a ledger  Create a phantom account wallet  Then click connect a hardware wallet  Connect it  make sure that you turn on auto blund sign in ledger settings  Then go to serum  I recommend actually just using serum dex straight up  vs using a raydium pool as there is a closer conversion for price  Youll literally get prices conversion rates exactly equal to centralized exchanges     like  1   Load you wallet with sol or usdc and trade  Easy peazy  Nothing ever sees your private keys even the phantom wallet What s the best vpn for laptop and cell phone Hmm interesting  Thanks for the response Confused as to what wallet this would be stored on after I purchase on the Serum DEX Great point  OP is doing a disservice driving people to Exodus which uses a validator with poor performance Does anyone know which validator Kraken is using  I can t seem to find it anywhere but I m also not a user of their platform so I can t get on I approved this post of yours again  it seems you account is   Shadow Banned   or something Well I only have one upvote to give but I gave it   I may not agree with you but who wants an echo chamber   Let s let a variety of opinions be expressed here   No need to downvote thoughtful and respectfully presented posts even if you don t agree with them p s  I have no actual opinion on Shiba Much easier ways Crypto com coinbase or ftx   Then take all your solana and it it in a sollet io wallet and you good Is the staking real staking   Or is it custodial lending that they call staking   The 6 5  max APY is strange too  almost all Solana validators pay more than that Weird that USDC is missing So farming generates additional rewards for liquidity providers   That s correct  How does this work    Once you provide liquidity to a pool you get LP token  These LP tokens represent your share of the pool   so don t transfer these tokens to anyone else or they will have ownership of your share of the pool and the coins  Now you could just keep these LP tokens sitting around and see your share of the liquidity worth more as the trading fees are added back to pool  But most AMMs like Raydium give you an option to  farm  your LP tokens  This is what you see under the farm tab on Raydium  You have your RAY   SOL LP token and you can stake it to the RAY   SOL farm to earn the farming reward  In case of the RAY   SOL LP it is    72  yearly as of right now  You get this reward in RAY tokens   Where does these rewards come from   From the Automated Market Maker aka Raydium or Uniswap  They give away their tokens to incentivise building up their liquidity pools for each market and kick start the business so that traders have a liquid market to change from RAY to SOL  for example In Raydium s case  they give away 34  of all tokens  or 188 7m RAY for mining in 36 month   In which currency did the liquidity providers get the fee in a RAY SOL pool  Both  RAY and SOL   Correct  It depends on what way the trade takes place  For example  when you swap RAY for SOL you pay the trading fee in RAY  In a high volume  liquid market a lot of swaps happen in each way so the pool receives fees in both tokens of the pair  You can find examples and details about the fees on farming rewards on  Raydium  docs  https   raydium gitbook io raydium      Farming and earning extra RAY for liquidity  https   raydium gitbook io raydium yield farming raydium farms   Simple  liquidity pool fee calculation  https   raydium gitbook io raydium exchange trade and swap liquidity pools  and details at the end  About RAY token and how it is allocated in  tokenomics  https   raydium gitbook io raydium tokenomics the ray token I hope it helps  Happy farming  It s honest work Who you delegate to is completely up to you  As far as security  you own your keys so it s definitely more secure than staking on an exchange like Kraken or Binance where the exchange controls the keys and you re not insured in the event of a hack  As far as malicious the worst case scenario I can think of is if the team behind moonlet completely disapeared and had their app removed from app stores but even then you could just import your account to another wallet like sollet  solflare etc as if nothing happened  I personally use both Moonlet and Sollet    Moonlet for staking and only checking in on it probably once a week at most unless I m adding more funds to stake  Sollet for interacting with defi apps and yeild farms since it s the solana s equivalent of metamask I actually saw that the other day when I was on the site and thought that was interesting 6 5   HELL YEAH    I am so happy    I m transferring it off of Binance US  amp  over to Kraken at this exact moment Hi  amp  x200B What s the reward percentage for staking SOL on FTX  Kraken now offers 6 5   What is the percentage on FTX I could be wrong  so someone please correct me if I am  but as I understand the wrapping process  it isn t wFTT isn t just mirroring the price of FTT  but is  real  FTT  but bridged over to Solana  So wETH  wALEPH etc are all  real  tokens  in the sense of being part of the tokenomics as say ex an ERC20 token is  just  ported  over to a different layer 1 explorer solana com has history as well  you have to click each transaction separately though Can you speak on moonlet s security  Maybe noob question  but I m considering using Moonlet with my ledger  but who am I delegating my SOL to  Is there a chance I ll lose my SOL if the team behind Moonlet is malicious Can you stake with Solong Agreed  Hopefully a product before the end of this year  Taxman won t be happy otherwise Good news  We all did a lot of crying when they didn t allow US in the original listing  So it time to rejoice I had the same question  The guys at step finance say they are working on something along these lines  No sign of it yet though There s a market for a good product here for sure I agree with this risky eventually will get your account locked  Had it happen to friends before  Just create SOL wallet and then use the DEX for now purchase SOL and HODL them until we find better alternatives Lock me in please for atleast 20 years  then I can t sell Well  i just found this Tweet  i m sure it s something you re looking for   https   twitter com wilbarnes status 1410573987667755012  https   twitter com wilbarnes status 1410573987667755012 I have done this for sure but this might increase your chances of them locking your account so be careful That s my brain getting smoother everyday Then you re a very smart hooman it s not a cache issue  the calculations are made on the client on the fly    If you enter in 100 SOL to stake  your rewards are apparently 25 SOL   If you enter in 10 SOL to stake  your rewards are 2 5 SOL   No matter what amount of SOL you enter into the calculator as the amount to stake  the rewards produced by the calculator are 25  APY Exactly    Haha what a joke  OP is trying to say now there was no issue from the start    why would I see 25  then the first time I visit the site lol  nothing would have been cached  And it STILL shows 25   from whatever browser I access from The calculator is broken They all show 250 SOL rewards annually   It s not a cache issue In the end it s the choice of the user to choose a validator they want  We made the guides and we have the right to promote our pool in our guides  You don t have to use them  As for Exodus   that is true because Everstake has been collaboraring with  Solana team closely on many products including the wallet adoption in this case  You are free to choose another way to stake  which is SolFlare or Ledger  whatever makes sense to you crypto com Actually  I just re checked it now  It clearly states 7  APR and it calculates correctly  I have 70 SOL rewards shown for 1000 staked  Please clear the webpage cache and refresh the page  could be the cache issue Solfarm is you want to auto compound your yields  You get paid out in their Tulip token  I m staking my raydium on solfarm for around 33  and getting around 15  in Tulip  I usually just sell the Tulip for more raydium to compound my yields even faster  There s higher risk higher reward pools on solfarm but I m not in any of them  Most of my high yield borderline degen plays are on Matic or bsc side of things Thank you for encouraging feedback Hi  Currently  Solana does not implement slashing though it will be in place in future most likely  Slashing will be implemented in response to intentional validator malicious behavior  such as creating invalid transactions or censoring certain types of transactions or network participants  in some chains it s also for skipping a block production cycle etc  However  at this point you don t need to stress about it Why not just send them to moonlet  Or another wallet Hero to villain in the next tournament Just what I thought Correct and accurate returns for all Solana validators are available here https   stakeview appNote that Everstake over the past month or so is at 7 03  APY  which is mediocre and bested by many 10  commission validators p s  25  APY is an absolute lie Slashing is not implemented on Solana yet  so for the time being  and the near to medium term  you are safe from slashing no matter what you do Of course  staking with Everstake is like self slashing all the time since you are giving up returns for a poor quality validator It s awesome if you like advertisements for Everstake Just buy on binance anyways on a VPN and move to a cold wallet You can install the solana command line tool and use     solana transaction history  lt ADDRESS gt to get a historic list of transactions involving that account   I don t know how far back the history goes though  I ve played with it a bit and in my case it had them all but I can t guarantee it will for really old transactions Of course  you just get a list of transaction ids so you then have to feed that into further queries to get transaction details   This would be best accomplished by scripting if you have the skills You can buy a stable coin   DAI   USDT  from Newton and convert it to  SOL on Coinbase  Somebody else mentioned FTX already too  as a Coinbase alternative  The former is pretty easy though Good to go then  No taxes to file  You win Ftx Hope you have validate your wallet in other not to lose more coin in future when it hits more bigger on Chainlink How are you calculating the rewards  it seems very inaccurate    if you have 1000 SOL in a staking account  you earn 250 SOL annually   What platform offers 25  APY  I have looked into Solflare  and seems like the best you can do there is 8 5    so not sure where you are getting your numbers Hope you have validate your wallet in other not to lose more coin in future when it hits more bigger on Solana I m in a similar situation in Hawaii  I ve been using simpleswap to get it  It works but it s slow and kind of nerve wracking Just want to stake Solana and earn the max APY possible I was exactly looking for this So farming generates additional rewards for liquidity providers  How does this work  Where does these rewards come from In which currency did the liquidity providers get the fee in a RAY SOL pool  Both  RAY and SOL When I did this to my FTX wallet they credited my account  I have no faith in Binance as my history with them has been less than helpful
2021-07-02,33.30630993,34.03178588,31.47992402,So far just stake  Been testing out the ecosystem I m a total noob so all of this is new to me  Serum seems really cool  raydium  and solape I ve been playing with  Oxygen Protocol and Mercurial Finance I got my eye on too In order for that to happen bitcoin would need to go back or near it s ath of around 60k  which is highly unlikely Cool stuff   Previously I have looked at the Stake History chart on this page https   solanabeach io supplyBut it is super hard to read and not easy to tell what epoch the latest data point is for What you have implemented seems a lot better suited to this purpose   Nice work Thanks I couldn t get any explanation why my account didn t appear with that configuration  it already appears great Stake it  amp  forget about it till it hits  100 The Solana Foundation is delegating its own SOL  Of course they know where it s going  My problem with stake pools is that if the price of SOL is high enough  then it becomes profitable to run more than one validator to increase the probability of getting SOL delegated by a pool That doesn t actually increase censorship resistance  it just obfuscates the number of unique entities that can halt the network  eth2 style  with its  170 000 validators Solana has been holding stronger through recent dips than any other coin I track  Really shows a lot of promise Looking forward to it When bitcoin starts moving up it will definitely break a new ATH  SOL has been holding really strong compared to other ALTs during this dip and consolidation I found this through a google search looking for staking options now that Sol is available on coinbase  Thanks for posting this  Seems like Solflare is the way to go Is Solflare the preferred place to stake here Absolute Respect and Appreciation for your taking the time to write such a helpful  high quality  clear  and detailed response This helps fill in the gaps and recalibrate my misperceptions regarding Solana validator and integration dimensions Thanks again  And best of luck in your endeavors  validator or otherwise   Peace Enjoy your  0 15 i am actually having the same problem as you  mistakenly send my unwrapped sol into my solana binance wallet  which is the exact same thing it clearly show in solana beach and i have the tx id and the transaction is actually confirmed   there s actually a website that you could unwrapped those tokens  but it doesn t suppport binance  only sol wallet  oh my life Awesome  Super trustworthy  I only use kraken and FTX anymore for staking and daytrading Solana is the most  open  of the blockchains you mentioned with regards to how validators operate   By that I mean  there is literally  no  restriction on who can participate in Solana as a validator   Any one can immediately join the Solana network and start validating  and their validator s consensus votes on blocks will immediately start taking effect This is in contrast to other blockchains that have more stringent rules about who can be a validator   Other blockchains require validators to be included in a special set  and the inclusion process can include being voted on by existing validators  or nominated and voted on by stakers  including implicit  voting  via stake delegation and having to pass a stake threshold  or other methods   Those other approaches may have their own unique advantages and disadvantages But in the end  only Solana of the chains you mentioned is as completely open to new validators That being said    on Solana  stake rules   A validator with no or little stake can participate  but it will be a money losing venture  and without any stake  its votes will hold no weight  and with little stake  its votes will hold little weight Therefore  most of the difficulties around establishing a validator on Solana and sustaining it surround acquiring stake   This can be a very difficult problem in and of itself  because it becomes more of a  marketing  issue than anything   Validators that make themselves well known and get a good reputation will likely get more stake Moreover  there are large players at work who have  tons  of Solana and as a result they have a greater degree of control over which validators are actually sustainable and which have a larger voting impact on the network  via larger stake amounts    By the way  this is also true in all PoS networks  so this aspect is not unique to Solana at all In addition  be aware that in Solana  end users who create dapps and other programs on the block chain  do not have to have any affiliation with any validator   Validators are not responsible for nor involved in which on chain programs are created  unless the validator is also run by an organization that does those things too  and any valid on chain program may be added to the network  no single validator can veto it or prevent it   So anybody can be a validator on Solana  and anybody can create a dapp or on chain program  and the two sets don t have to overlap at all In short  NO  blockchain development organizations do not need to run their own validator However    it turns out that a lot of larger organizations that helped to develop Solana have leveraged those positions into relationships with large stake holders that then end up providing a TON of stake to them  so it becomes profitable for them to run their own validator just because with those connections and that stake  they can make a lot of SOL   Many of the validators in the top 15 by stake weight are in this position Disclaimer  I run a Solana validator  but I m not in the top 15 Just bought my first 2 SOL to diversify Is it  Not sure ChainLink is the Oracle for Solana  right My point is simple  do better   Provide more accurate information  and yes this does mean doing the diligent work of making sure that your data is accurate   do better by end users by giving them better staking options that don t lock into a single validator  and run your validator better so that it gets better returns for its end users That s all   Just do better If your answer is  it s too hard and takes too much time  then I will understand  because it is hard and takes a lot of time for all of us   But at least let s just be honest and clear about what is going on here   It is possible to do better I said  very well done gt  Какой вы молодецWell I translated it   Sounds like some kind of sarcastic remark I ll just remind you that  you  are the one who chose to say  Everstake has been collaboraring with Solana team closely on many products including the wallet adoption in this case  so I think that asking for clarification on that is perfectly reasonable Your response was kind of tit for tat which is not really warranted but whatever Anyway I have nothing against you personally  I m just trying to make sure that end users are not deceived It states only one fact that when you have about 45 blockchains to manage the stake  plus hundreds o guides and educational articles  it s possible to miss some updates  indeed  However  as I explained already few times to your endless comments  it s not a crucial point of the guide  The point is to show How to stake  not state the explorer stats  which change every day Maybe you stop getting too personal  And maybe you stop duplicating comments here and there  What s the point Well I assume it s very hard not to notice big digit if 7  in half a screen in Exodus   plus  i don t consider users that simple not to notice that the guide was written earlier and the APR could change  However  yours right  we ll correct that in the guides ASAP  I have actually already made a task for our team May i answer you in Russian  Какой вы молодец Then why not allow your wallet solution to give the user a choice about where to stake   Reserve 10  for your own validator  or some similar quantity  sure    but give end users the choice for the remainder BTW I would say exactly the same thing to every other single validator staking wallet  if I could   But you are the first actual representative of any of these validators that I ve managed to actually find   I actually appreciate the fact that you are out here and responding to feedback  that s definitely a step up from the other guys Mine is when prices  go down for a sustained period  I am not saying we are 100  in a bear market  I personally think we are and there is maybe only a 15 20  we see new highs this year  The other replier is butthurt that I think that but he s probably coping   Either way when we are 50  below aths and things have been trending down for over a month you have to at least entertain the idea I have not used moonlet wallet but it was my understanding that they allowed a selection of validators   I am asking honestly for someone to confirm this  I am not currently at a computer where I could test it   If moonlet doesn t allow selecting validators  then I 100  agree with cel3sta about this point and will personally not recommend them in future What exactly is a bear market in crypto  Seems hard to put a rigid definition on and I m sure many have their own opinion Nope   Mostly I just fight misinformation wherever I see it   For example  Everstake misrepresented returns as 10 3  for quite a long time  and I see they have recently changed it to a more accurate 7    I don t suppose my comments about this on Discord and here in reddit  constantly correcting people who quoted that misrepresented APY  had anything to do with it In addition  I think that it s really terrible to produce a popular staking solution that doesn t give end users any choice about validator to stake to   Sure  reserve a small portion of stake for yourself   but not 100    That is greedy and just outright bad for Solana  period   So yeah  I fight against it Normally people would provide disclaimers though  surely you are aware of that I haven t been in the ecosystem nearly as long so my contributions are more limited I ve done some smaller things   a few small code changes to the Solana command line client  some doc fixes   but mostly my contributions have been creating stakeview app to debunk alot of misinformation about returns on Solana  and a lot of help to end users in Discord and Reddit   I also have other projects underway which I will announce later Crypto com What does everyone think about the amount of nodes for 33  consensus halt power  see solanabeach io   Right now it s at 14  which seems like a good start  Does everyone think this will just improve with time as more validators come online  Is there more the solana foundation can do to help Jumpstart the decentralization  Interested to hear other people s thoughts on this koinly is not too bad actually  They already support the defi transactions on eth  polygon and bsc chains  Solana is work in progress  and don t have a ETA yet   I am thinking of writing code to turn the output of  solscan io  https   solscan io  into a simple excel sheet Not sure what the liquidity pool for SLIM SOL looks like but you might not get a good conversion rate  Will probably be better to swap for USDC instead  Of course doesn t really matter with such a small amount Lol you wish  Keep dreaming to make yourself feel better What type of Staking Reward   can you earn on Raydium today   Raydium is at  3 44 today You can probably get a ballpark estimate by measuring the effect of May crash  Considering the severe drops of BTC and comparing that to the drops of alts  let s say top 100  you can get a rough sense of leverage that was liquidated  For example  Harmony  with no lending platforms  initially didn t react at all  only dropping a couple days later  Terra plummeted by 75  immediately  my guess is due to Anchor Protocol  which collateralizes your Luna   I d say it s safe to say that most leverage was liquidated during the last crash  unless the collateral was USD based  Fear greed index may come in handy too  my guess is there is a lot of deleveraging happening during the fear phase and excess leverage during greed phase You are not looking at earnings or dividends 1yr 38   5yr 212  That s just s amp p 500 which very few people invest in exclusively   Much higher if you invest in mid and small cap  and high dividend earners swearing    the use of offensive language towards other people    we don t want that  You may always explain what you have in mind without swearing  it is possible  D No swearing  This is crypto Thank you  this is really helpful  Are the tokenomics reliable  What happens after 36 months  Is staking Raydium used for consensus mechanism or does this just provide a a financial incentive Nice Well my comments certainly were not unfair or irrelevant  they were spot on  Your post gave people false information  your guides are worthless The point is  someone might decide to stake on the misinformation provided in your guides  the 25  APY you essentially promise them  When they go through the actual process they might miss the correct actual APY  or at the very least have conflicting information with what your guides have given them  I am not sure how you fail to understand this  Let s also get one thing straight  my first comment questioning your numbers was not rude at all  You continuously responded with misinformation and downvoted my subsequent comments because you failed to realize that you yourself  the author of this post  posted misinformation in the form of four links that you advertised as guides to earn 25  APY when staking your SOL As you said  it s your post    you should own your mistakes  not try to push blame onto others  Update the calculator  include an APY  as of ___date___   as well as a disclaimer I buy Sol on Blockfolio I meant its actual worth  OP is trying to exchange like  0 16 of slim for sol Don t you want to become a SLIMillionaire I see now  First of all  some of the Guides were written months ago and the APR was different then  We ve been running our node in Solana for quite some time The real APR is stated in the wallets and in the Explorer  if someone decides to stake   it will be highlighted straight away  We won t update the guides each time the APR changes  each day   I think it s understandable 2  I m a girl  not a dude 3  I have the right to downvote comments that I consider rude or unfair  or irrelevant  It s my post  sorry  dude What dont you like about it I m confused how you could be so clueless as to what site we are talking about    read your own post That s a great suggestion       Thank you No dude  how would I magically navigate to a URL that wasn t even included in the post  I am talking about the four links you provided in your post  under  Check Our Guides on Staking SOL    stop downvoting my comments that make perfect sense gt Similar to the pattern when Exodus by default stakes to Everstake  Moonlet wallet stakes to their node  Hence  evidently  I cannot promote them     gt    gt They must be a great validator too  and it s always good to split the stake between few validators Checked it out  Similar to the pattern when Exodus by default stakes to Everstake  Moonlet wallet stakes to their node  Hence  I cannot promote them  But  as I replied to another commenter below  they must be a great validator too  and it s always good to split the stake between few validators Just checked it out  thx  Similar to the pattern when Exodus by default stakes to Everstake  Moonlet wallet stakes to their node  Hence  evidently  I cannot promote them  They must be a great validator too  and it s always good to split the stake between few validators No problem  I have added links to track our projects and contribution to SOL ecosystem  Please check above in the post What about your contribution to ecosystem as a validator  Waiting for symmetrical answer I got a ledger X for this and it solved all those issues  Basically allows you to keep all the keys to the coins you mentioned in one place while staking delegating  I use BlockFi to dollar cost average in then every few months transfer to cold storage or my ETH wallet to provide liquidity on UniSwap  So far it s a great system and I only need two recovery seeds  ETH  amp  Ledger How far underwater are you Sollet Lol  You are trash at understanding cycles Have fun hodling your ponzis to zero Lol bear market  Clown Don t you need sol to pay fees That slim is worthless Ah  I guess the 0 01 SOL  or lack of it  was the problem You forgot about moonlet Seems to be trading with the market  Keeps trying to pass litecoin in market cap  it eventually will for good apes don t read charts but i been in trees watching solana for a week I want this more now   Very strong crypto You may try the Dex exchange of Raydium instead of the Swap feature  Also make sure your SOL wallet have at least 0 01 SOL I simply stake on FTX   any better ones you d recommend with no cool down period Nice Ftx That s cool feature added for solanians As far as I checked the wallet description  not at the moment I promote Everstake because I work at Everstake and we made these guides  what s wrong with that    Of course  i propose to stake with us  I don t know what you mean about poor returns or some other posts on Reddit   please use clear and fare arguments Always welcome  ️ Could be you are placing all these negative comments because you are running a SOL validator too    I bet there s enough space for everyone in the Solana network  We are  2 in the list of validators currently and it has nothing to do with the  poor quality  performance you are trying to impose on the competitor Thank you for appreciation What site are you mentioning  I m talking about https   everstake one solana Are you talking about our staking calculator on https   everstake one solana   It calculates 7   correctly  I just checked once again Yesterday while Bitcoin and everything else was falling down Solana and Hbar were like  Nah I said we going up today Next up Rugcoin Atomic wallet has sol staking  do you recommend This is old Sell everything else and keep Solana   Easy Why doesn t  FTX US  https   FTX US  allow for SOL staking  like  FTX com  https   FTX com  does  Seems dumb for SBF and company not to get on this ASAP Solflare and Moonlet are applications  the first web based  the second mobile  for accessing your wallet  in order to  a  learn its public address  in order to send SOL to it   b  send SOL from your wallet  if there is already SOL in it   c  stake the SOL in your wallet  So once you send your SOL from  FTX US  https   FTX US  to your wallet s public address  you can use Solflare  Moonlet  or another app to do these things Thanx for the reply Thanx mate Thank you for the detailed explanation Thanks for making this Disclaimer  I run Shinobi Systems validator Yes  Shinobi Systems has the highest returns across almost every epoch  although this epoch GenesysGo  who has come on really strong over the past month or so  is actually doing better The differences in returns between the top spot and lower spots is not that drastic though   So I would recommend spreading stake anywhere in the top 20 or so validators for returns  and you might even look lower down the list   or on a different list  say https   validators app   for some of your staking too Also with regards to system uptime   it s basically built into APY  because downtime means missed votes and missed votes mean lower APY   Therefore  high APY is basically a proxy for  high uptime  I don t know of anything to explicitly  worry  about    your SOL is always your own  unless you use something like Kraken or another custodial wallet that owns your SOL    and as long as you check in periodically to make sure your validator is still performing up to your expectations  then really you should be fine I know  I have too many hot  amp  cold wallets  exchanges etc   I m trying to streamline  amp  consolidate It s just too much for me to have specific wallets for  SOL  ADA  ALGO  ATOM  FTM  MATIC  EOS  amp  all the ERC20s   then the cold storage BTCI keep thinking  if I get hit by a train  how the hell is my wife going to know what to do with all this  It s a lot to keep track of   Just trying to keep it all safe in no more than 4 5 places    Cheers Check Solfarm io for some yields  You add liquidity in Raydium  and then stake the LP token in Solfarm for autocompounding Aww yeah Lol u are right Bro its called apexit what did we expect Hi  how do I go about minting multiple NFTs  Like say 10 000 Looking at stake view  it seems shinobi systems has the highest return rate with 0  commission  Is this the best place to stake  Since slashing is not yet a thing  is there anything to be worried about besides system uptime when choosing a staking location They have had this for awhile on the mobile app at least  made me buy more seeing it I have tried reporting many times but they all say the device is not enough to dig again You can buy BTC  send it to your exodus wallet and exchange it to Sol there  You can also stake the Sol from within the Exodus wallet for 6 7  currently Since when is Chainlink part of the Solana ecosystem  I thought that was a separate project Where would you stake solana if its upto you Depends where you go  Kraken  Yes that s custodial  but solflare is delegated  and you own the keys If you instead transfer it to solflare you get 7 5  and you own the keys Yeah the entire DeFi space  liquidity pools  and yield aggregators in general  Well  I ve been keeping a really crappy Excel sheet for now  but if someone can get a product out that can actually handle DeFi  they will be so rich How do you go about adding more to your stake  Just create a new staking account  That s so annoying for people who regularly DCA lol Your coins are on the blockchain  You re not lending them to Moonlet  I actually have the same  wallet  in both Solflare  where I originally created it with my Ledger  and then imported it into Moonlet You can get 11   on Moonlet  and use a Ledger Nano X to boot  ‍ ️ lol  DYOR is a lazy persons response Nice  I haven t checked it in a while  will look tonight Same shit   Sollet good for mobile and phantom for desktop How is kraken in general Some of these are a reach right  Link etc Kraken allows SOL for trading now I think more than a few do this to trade leverage  There are risks associated Stake in kraken 6 5
2021-07-03,34.01557504,35.40477019,33.29847492,Oooh gotcha  glad it s going below the halt line Oh I will most definitely be paying taxes  And I m sure those exchanges will be letting the IRS know your the one in control of the crypto you just removed from their platform  I m not well versed in the tax codes  still getting familiar with them  I am curious how there going to handle staking rewards when it comes to taxes  Are they taxed like dividends  are they different if I stake myself or due it through an exchange  how are exchanges reporting my rewards  I m kinda blank on the tax side of things  but I know the tax man is coming lol  I do wanna know how the IRS is gonna deal with the thousands of people that are going to claim their crypto was  lost  or  stolen  and how their going to go about proving it  I see them saying you took the risk  now pay us our cut Yeah sorry for my confusion earlier  as I now understand it  what is happening is that 18 million SOL  not 118 million  is being added to the foundation staking program  and all of that stake does indeed go to validators below the  halt line  of top validators adding up to 33  of stake Farm on raydium participate in acceleraytor launches  Trade on serum dex  which I access on the trading tab of the raydium website Stake to smaller validators that don t make up the top 33  of consensus I m super excited about some of the games being built on solana but I think it will be awhile before any of them are available to play  star atlas  openera  DeFiLand I also like looking for nft opportunities  The coolest ones I ve found so far are solarians I m always very skeptical of technical analysis on crypto currencies  especially ones that have been trading for only 1 yr  and way less than that for any meaningful volumes  Although I wouldn t say no to a 80 117 price target by end of year Hi  A big thanks for this clear answer  the crypto community is really awesome  However  you have to pay certain taxes to switch from the exchange platform to the secure wallet if I m not mistaken  I see that more and more sensitive subjects currently about Binance for example  that s why I was wondering    Thank you again for your answer bro TA prediction for SOL is extremely bearish  but saying that it ll go to  1 12 is nonsense  I just hope it gets to  15  20 to buy some There was a 1 sol and 0 1 bnb airdrop  around 3 weeks ago I participated but didn t get any of it They said that i will get it in 1 week  but i didnt get anything Anyone knows why is that Thanks again for the very informative reply Thank you  I tried signing up about 3 months ago and I ve yet to be verified to use the platform  ‍   Idk if I ve been forgotten about or what lol  I do hear it s a great exchange though  especially for easy staking Thanks for your input  I know most people just buy and sell  so that s nice to hear the actually blockchain works smoothly  And the amount of projects already working on Solana was a big plus for me as well btw it doesnt let me connect my phantom wallet only after changing to solong in options and back to phantom  Console seemed to not sending request to rpc Since some platforms do not really inform that you re about to swap SPL for WSOL  i think it would be handy to put it a bit more in highlight on your platform or even  if not avbl  maybe cool product to offer   integrate in partner wallets   Cool way to make users come back on regular basis   gt  anticipation in future launchesI got asked that question like hundreds of times Never a stupid question  The whole not your keys  not your coins thing  Exchanges write in there policies that basically while you keep your coins with them they re actually the exchanges property until you move them off said exchange  But also if an exchange is experiencing high traffic  usually during a crash or sell off they re networks can bog down and prevent you from making whatever moves you were planning to do  sell or buy   Having your crypto in a wallet separate from an exchange gives you the ability to use different options One example I have is when coinbase pro added polkadot  DOT   they had it listed about 1  higher than the global average  I don t know the prices exactly  but I could swap it on atomic wallet for 16  a coin  and go sell it back on coinbase for 17   So sometimes having a wallet can be of more of a benefit then just for added security  And I think people use multiple wallets since there isn t a  perfect  wallet that can do it all in one spot  Just my experience with it  Thank you for your question though I wanna know too Maybe an idiot question  but why should we stack on wallets instead of exchange platforms Sorry to have been such an idiot   Turns out I misread the announcement   It uses some confusing terminology  referencing  stake pools  and  foundation delegation  in the same context when in fact they are different things  but I think that if I had read more carefully I still should have been able to get it right There is only 18 million SOL being added in  not 118 000 000 SOL   The Foundation already delegates 100 million to foundation staked nodes   This is not new stake going to arbitrary validators via stake pools  it is new stake going just to foundation staked nodes  increasing the size of that program by about a fifth Still good news  just not quite the huge news I thought it was Yes  the 100  commission validators are basically completely self staked    they own their staked SOL and they use 100  commission to make it convenient to manage since the stake rewards are then all paid out to the validator and can be sold each epoch on an ongoing basis   Sometimes the validator also has locked accounts  for example  the founders and some other early investors have locked accounts that can t be sold for some time  and using 100  commission allows them to earn maximum rewards on those accounts in the form of SOL that is not locked so can be sold immediately Also you are very astute in noticing that yes  validators can change their commission at any time  including from 0  to 100    In fact it is more insidious than that   A 0  commission validator could change their commission to 100  right before the epoch ends  then let the 100  commission earn them  all  the rewards  stakers get nothing   then switch back to 0  commission right after that   So 99 99  of the time  it would  look like  they have 0  commission  but when it actually counted  they d be taking 100  commission This would obvously be a very unscrupulous thing to do  and I have never heard of a validator doing anything like that   If they did and were found out  their reputation would be completely destroyed What would be even more subtle is for example a validator keeping commission at 7  most of the time and switching to 9  just on epoch boundaries to earn 9  commission while most of the time looking like a 7  commission validator   The difference in returns would be subtle enough that stakers may not notice that their returns are sightly lower than they  should be  I have thought about adding a feature to https   stakeview app that would display the  actual commission charged  in addition to the advertised commission  to ensure that if such a thing ever happened  stakers could know about it   But since as far as I know it has never happened  I haven t been as motived to do so as I probably should be   I ll consider adding that feature as soon as I can For prices I mean swapping Ray into sol usdc srm to obtain even more LP tokens btw I ve been LPing on raydium io for just over a month now and have run into no issues  Only tip I would give is if you are harvesting and reinvesting use either Raydiums trading tab or the serum dex itself for much better prices  And I even think there s maker rebates on syrum if you post and then get filled I personally don t have SRM  but I farm Ray and Sol through Raydium which yields RAY tokens  They have a RAY SRM LP if you hold both  Obviously not a pure SRM stake if you only want to hold SRM but might be something to look into Buy Bitcoin on Shakepay send to exodus and exchange for Solana  Lose a little in fees but at least you get your SOL    Can stake Solana directly on exodus as well I have multiple staking wallets  SolFlare is the best imo where you can delegate to multiple validators  while Exodus wallet is a very convenient way to stake but limits your options  I am diversified across both As for the other question  I must say I chose Solana because it has many great projects that are still in very early stages  I ve tried to get into DeFi  NFT s  etc  on other chains before but was never able to fully get into it due to high fees and latency issues  Solana s protocol has been a dream to interact on I am relatively new to the Solana party myself  And I just started staking on Kraken for 6 5   But that s mainly because I am so new to SOL and haven t explored all of the staking options yet geozuk s post was worded in a confusing manner   I believe they meant  Because despite fundamentals we see Doge at top  or cardano top 4 gt  Orca prohibits use of its services in the United States due to regulatory uncertainty in that jurisdiction  Orca will also monitor any unauthorized access from US based IPs and take action accordingly  So much for that Whats the transaction rate on that  aren t exodus fees pretty ludicrous  I m already using the wallet and I remember checking the fees once and having a good laugh That s exactly what I meant What is est fee  Do we have to pay that to stake sol usdt Doge has no fundamentals and cardatrash is still filled with nearly empty if not completely empty trash what do you mean lol it already did  you missed it It is an APY of 50  per year for 7 days  After it may be different for the following 7 days period Pls how do I find SAMO address on sollet io Good luck Are you more of fundamentals techs  Because then we see Doge at top  or cardano top 4 without having smart contracts I ve found that TA in crypto is largely bull crap  This isn t the stock market  And so many of these TA  experts

like yahoo   it won t be killed but will lose to Google  solana Yeah fair enough Yup  Exodus temporarily had issues exchanging Sol  Back working now  it says   I would just give it time  a regular business day tomorrow should fix it I would think as things get done  Holiday today and last Thursday depending where you live  Slow work week Yup  Exodus temporarily had issues exchanging Sol  Back working now  it says   I would just give it time  a regular business day tomorrow should fix it I would think as things get done  Holiday today and last Thursday depending where you live  Slow work week Exodus was having weird issues with sol the last few days  It wasn t showing up in my wallet for 24 hours a day ago and they weren t allowing exchanges of Solana in app  I m staking and it s showing back now but they may still be having issues  If the address is right it ll show up in a day most likely That s what I was looking for  Thanks My withdraw of Solana been pending It s happening to me too rn my withdraw is pending wtf Yes check out symmetry it s in solana Coinbase has a  status page  https   status pro coinbase com   you can check for this kind of issue  It looks like they posted about this problem earlier today Ya thats what I do soMove sol from ftx to sollet  hook it up raydium Swap half sol for RayAdd liquidity for Ray to sol Stake the LP token in raydium Harvest raydium and add liquidity to ray   usdc poolStake those LP token in farm   ray   usdcApr   2     65     75    on harvest If there is a option to stake LP tokens from sol  usdc  that would be ideal for me Same issue  On my 7th hour waiting same issue here sending to another wallet and pending still Well  DeFi is not limited to ethereum or solana  Solana has not yet the Titanic development of project ethereum has  Fees are lower and development is easier  but it s still novelThe question is what will actually bring value to the table 1  BTC will hold at least half of the value of the ecosystem and if any chain manages to capture most of that  it will make it easier to provide store of value capacity  ETH has wrapped BTC that can be traded in much higher volume and market cap than solana for the moment2 AMM and Liquidity Pools are another thingy  Uniswap is older and bigger than Serum or Raydium  Serum is bringing more novelty on the table with the orderbook  Yet we need deep incentivised liquidity pools to be able to say that Sol is better  Solfarm and other solutions in yield farming as possibly slip based fee AMMs are needed3 Synthetic assets can bypass cross chain limitations  SNX is massive projet with a ton of options yet the fees make it unusable  Synthetify and the upcoming Fabric projects in Solana may win the game if they remain impenetrable to hacking3  The NFT market will bring actual value on the table  Art  passports  concert tickets  anything can be used via blockchain and NFTs  Which chain will dominate      So yeah  a lot remain to be seen  Sol is already cheap and fast  but needs a lot of buidl   Eth is built massive but is kept hostage by the miners    Tic toc I own both so I m hoping they both excel into the next 5 10 years Has CB Pro given you a txnid  What does it show on solanabeach  or other block explorer Eth has also been around since 2015   perspective I feel like ETH bulls started it the concept with the concept of the flippening  and the original bad attitude some people had towards BTC   And I m sure whoever actually dropped the slogan first deffinitely must have been some crypto guru youtuber trying to pump his investment    What sucks is that a lot of the new  majority of  the community is so damned impressionable that it only takes a few dozen people to jump on board to run with that trend  You take that obnoxious trend  put it on a mainstream NON crypto centered news stream  and you suddenly have tens of thousand misinformed people  who previously didn t plan to even absorb information about crypto  believing that there is a  crypto war  and that the volatility is due to lack of space to be occupied  and not the lack of adoption    It really is the worst attitude that the entire market can have  as far as getting new people into it goes My prediction is that the price will be higher than it is now  It depends on a lot of factors  but Cardano is bullshit and Eth will have scaling problems until they implement sharding  I expect a sizable share of the smart contract market will be up for grabs over the next 2 years I disagree  Eth is extremely risky  They are likely to never deliver what they are promising  Solana is here  works  with an insane tps  Just needs time for adoption  Also I think sharding is a bad solution for scalability No for sure  I totally agree  this is more of an exasperation at the community and media than the Devs  I assume MOST  excluding stuff like  poop on binance  of the time that actual devs probably have a more level headed view on these things than the meme hype guys  I literally cant watch news videos anymore where any of the correspondents have ANYTHING to say about specific coins because I ll cringe right out of my bones    But how do we change the narrative without just NOT being talked about Take a look at balancer V2  It s on Ethereum and Polygon tho 500 750  Will surpass ETH and cardano because they will fail to deliver a product comparable to solana Solanabeach io It s more of the media narrative that they like to push  never heard the team ever talk about it Agreed That was a really good listen reach out to solflare and ask for a bulk csv download rewards feature You are correct  the Solidity Ethereum contract for an ERC20 token is 20 lines of code  the Rust SPL token program is over 5000 lines  You are writing at a lower level and it s more complicated gt My main problem is lack of documentation This is true pretty much everywhere I ve ever worked in my entire life Yeah typically for USDC I use FTX since it handles it for me like a breeze Get a ledger nano It s likely Coinbase e A safe memory access would be a good start as a reason for me  Especially if its about a smart contract Does Coinbase Pro support USDC SPL   I thought they only support USDC ERC20 I actually believe that Solana has all the right ideas that can help it to be better than EOS and Ethereum I also believe that discord support is not a good substitute for actual documentation I has t the same issue even but now through coinbase pro     I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout I have the same issue right now through Coinbase Pro Thank you for this Those are ERC20 tokens  Sola token  and xSOL  Solana futures   ERC tokens run on the Ethereum network  Actual SOL is on the Solana blockchain  and Trezor currently does not support the Solana blockchain gt  no faucetsCan you point me to a Solana faucet I can give you some reasons 1  is not inclusive  big capital to open a node  high fees lately  growing concentration and no faucets 2  a lot of DeFi is in reality yielding by big players  lending money to themselves from pools where if something goes wrong all the others pay as well   that is precisely what Bitcoin was trying to free us from   and I want regulation to come on this3  we ll see how the update goes and what the others will have in the meantime maybe people who bought doge at 70c Alright  so where do you recommend me to save my solana Ah ok  So much will have to be written from scratch  This is still very early for Solana  There are a lot of developers interested in Solana though  The discord has hundreds of various levels It s not easy because there aren t a ton of copy and paste examples because it s still relatively new   That s a good thing   Once everyone writes a book on it makes youtube tutorial videos guess what  you missed the boat   Read the code figure it out What a lot of people don t realize is that the blockchain market isn t the OS market  mobile or desktop doesn t make a difference  where you as a user commit to an ecosystem by buying a device and then you are limited to only the apps that run on that platform It s very easy to jump between blockchain ecosystem and using many of them at the same same time is normal The Binance Smart Chain demonstrated how quick capital can move when a platform offers better opportunities than another  So a lot will depend on the dapps that will run on any blockchain  but the balance will quickly change over time if opportunities arise  We will have a rich selection of blockchains that will compete with each other  but there is room for many There will be casualties for sure  but I doubt it will be in the current top 15 20 by market cap as they all look as solid platforms Before making comment  we have to wait min 5 years for Solana  Then we will see what will happen   I think solana has the bright future with its capabilities It s a matter of opinion  But  I think that IF Ethereum 2 0 is released this year  which was announced to be in December  then it increases risks in SOL  I think ETH has less risk but maybe slightly less short term ROI  I have zero SOL and a lot of VET  ETH  MATIC  for short term HODL and Celsius APY That s assuming it ever comes out  And doesn t solana still have faster tps than eth 2  Solana is still in its infancy it came to the market last year Do people actually think ETH can be  killed gt  Why is it that the only selling point I ever hear when I find out about new other layer 1 solutions Which other one would work  given the complexities around blockchains By the way  I wouldn t consider most top 10 20 coins to have the ETH killer narrative  ADA  XRP  BCH  LTC  as they are clearly not focussed on smart contracts  DeFi Yes  But I m talking about smart contracts Lazy marketing  Needs a different angle  and also talking point that s easy to understand at scale  Being an ETH killer will get you nowhere  I agree Certainly its debatable  which is why the head devs of Solana quite literally   debated   amongst themselves as to what language should we write SOL in    they clearly decided upon Rust  I don t believe this was a  fuck it  decision  There must be reasons beyond my knowledge that led to this unanimous decision  From what I do understand  while  as you mentioned it is just a language of many  it is also for that reason given certain specific parameters in which  very specific nuiances of said language allow for the expansion and actualization of certain ideas that  maybe in a different language would be much more challenging  or infinitely more confusing to connect the dots of  Just saying   these dudes are smart as fuuuuuuark  they chose Rust not to be a cool cat on campus  but because it is  at least in their eyes   more advanced and allows them to do what they intend to  There are many clips of Anatoly talking about this on youtube and other sites  I am not a programmer  but my speculation is the above sentiment Hm that s certainly debatable   Rust is just a language  with pros and cons like any other   Solana could have been done in another language  there is no magical quality of Rust that makes it obviously superior Did you know that validators have been suffering from memory leaks in the validator code for quite a while now   Yes  even with Rust Why not   There is literally zero reason that I can think of for what you say   C C   can be used to develop a Solana on chain program so why would it not be suitable Won t work on Trezor one The Trezor Model  T  on the other hand is possible would need to verify for sure I have both  have not used my model  T  yet So I assume that you think isn t a good idea to hold Solana for the long term  Right I think there s a higher probability that SOL loses steam and starts to stabilize in a long term consolidation pattern  Why  Because ETH2 will suck up a lot of new and existing devs  attention  There may be a shift of new projects that would have gone on SOL or Polygon and shift to Ethereum I think there s a higher probability that SOL loses steam and starts to stabilize in a long term consolidation pattern  Why  Because ETH2 will suck up a lot of new and existing devs  attention  There may be a shift of new projects that would have gone on SOL or Polygon and shift to Ethereum tree fiddy But on this link that you send it says that is it supported  I m confused Good points I think there s a degree of truth to that  but there are also probably good developers who simply decide that Solana isn t mature enough because the developer experience isn t polished enough There s a reason that Anatoly was convinced to use Rust  It is the very reason solana is able to be coded in such unique and important ways  It s worth learning 1000000  over Unfortunately  it looks as though  Solana is not a supported coin  https   trezor io coins    at least not yet Great episode What part do you find illegible    Difficult  I agree with  but it s not illegible to me Imo I think C CPP is not suitable for smart contract development  And rust is really a weeks work at most for someone with C CPP background  just go for it Have you seen the website for the JavaScript SDK I know that you can use C   with EOSIO  EOS Oh man this looks super nice   i ll definitely borrow some features soon Interesting  thanks for sharing I remember on an episode of the Unchained podcast about Solana  they described developer difficulty as a feature rather than a bug  There is a perspective that this on boarding difficulty helps to bring in only serious developers and lessens the multitude of shitcoins and shitprojects  perhaps maybe seen on something like BSC   Here s the episode if you

towards 20k where do you think SOL is headed  DOWN My main problem is lack of documentation  But yeah  if you don t know Rust already  it can be even more challenging I think the biggest thing is learning Rust for smart contract development and learning Solana s cutting edge software architecture  Proof of History  Tower BFT  Sealevel  etc  You don t need to know the details of that stuff to

invest in smart contract platforms but outside of that there are just so many DEX es and other stuff  Maybe here Serum is  the  Dex and worth investing into  Either way i will get into Solana  Seems like there is allot of potential there These are wallets  Looks like staking pools  I could be wrong but they don t looo like wallets It s not you  It s really hard   Anchor  https   project serum

I d say  yes  it s not easy FWIW  PARTI  which I keep reading as  Part 1   is not listed on the solana  ecosystem  https   solana com ecosystem  page     And that page has a lot of stuff that is just barely related to solana     If you are a serious project it might be worth visiting that link  on it there is a place to try to get yourselves listed Looking at this now  seems to be just what I m looking for  thank you Not sure if this will help  https   youtu be AhMA3JYX9jAKin is on the Solana blockchain Go to learn figment ioThey have a great course that walks you through how to do most basic functions on Solana  Look for the Solana pathway  It uses React  but shows you how to build through the UI instead of using the CLI  They even pay people to produce even more tutorials and courses which I think is brilliant  I used to be part of EOS heavy in the early stages right after launch and there wasn t the same dedication to onboarding that I see with Solana  So I think Solana is actually one of the easier blockchains to build on  I ve heard some devs on Discord saying they were working on Vue and Angular tutorials too How much time   i am getting worried Do we know whats the frequency of the autocompound  Could not find info on that  Also  I see that Tulips are rewarded  Is that on top of the compounded APR 2 questions What s the details for the community airdrop Why should I use parti over solfarm or solyard Ever get this resolved   They took mine too They just took me for 17 SOL   only response was I would have to send  them  005 BTC to extract my coins   it is the correct receive address I used several times before  I can see my coins in the wallet even Hello Is there any other way if I only have the keystore file    Please help Check solfarm out Have you visited the Solana Discord   There are developer channels there  I think that you are more likely to get useful interactive help than you would get here Also check this out   It s quite a read and I haven t read all of it but it seems pretty dense with information https   paulx dev blog 2021 01 14 programming on solana an introduction You re entitled to your opinion  I ll take fundamentals over TA in crypto  at this juncture   In years time  the market will be mature enough to where TA makes sense  But as of right now  it s just a bunch of ppl guessing  throwing shots in the dark and using stock market analysis on crypto charts  amp  x200B Price predictions are literally wild guesses  Market is far too young for anyone to pretend to know what they re talking about and I think the recent correction humbled a lot of folks  But that s just my opinion Idk who are those  experts  you re citing  but keep in mind that TA is completely subjective  you can see whatever you want on charts  having the experience to sort that out is key to not get rekt   Between TA and fundamentals for trading I ll choose 100  TA  specially on this crypto market where the vast majority doesn t know the technology behind the product  But if you re interested in long term investments I guess I wouldn t recommend Elliott s wave nor Wyckoff s scheme as tools And no  price predictions aren t utterly useless  they would if you re hoping to get a good position based only in an arbitrary pattern I m sure it works for some but large in part TA  experts  in crypto have gotten totally rekt the past few months  Especially those who try to trade the chart day to day  they end up just losing money little by little lol This isnt the stock market yet they use stock market analysis on this young and volatile asset  It will go up or down  Buy Hold DCA will work best for 90  of investors  Price predictions are    utterly useless Are you familiar with Etherscan Tracking Bot  That   for Solana I think the bot can t do it  but it seems like a cool feature  Can you explain a bot more what do you expect the bot to do related to your staking It depends on what happens with BTC unfortunately  When BTC starts going back up  I think Solana could hit  100 easy  Long Term  500 isn t impossible but will take a lot more development and growth Wait wut  This can track my Solana staking on SolFlare Kraken recently made SOL available to purchase and stake  Check them out Agree with the second part  TA gave me a lot of profits tho Whichever coin s  you believe in buy hold DCA  Most charting TA and price predictions is bologna  Use tokenomics and whitepapers to help vet your investments
2021-07-05,34.28255049,34.46182386,32.48269155,Wow  thank you for this  Do you have any personal opinions on staking with exodus  Are they getting too much control Great to hear    I got a malfunctioning nano so I sent it back  I ll be doing the same when I receive it back  Thanks for the feedback Solflare isn t exactly the easiest to use  its kinda buggy  and I m sure Kraken Exodus are more user friendly  but I use Solflare because it allows me to store my SOL in my cold wallet and stake delegate directly from there  The security is worth the headache of setting up imo I m using exodus as well  Super easy to set up staking https   www reddit com r solana comments ocitcg oc _solana _staking _tracker _telegram _bot   https   www reddit com r solana comments ocitcg oc_solana_staking_tracker_telegram_bot   this bot  Now I m implementing live price tracking from serum ecosystem with bonfida API on top of it  I ll release a new version with this feature in few days  I hope you enjoy it What are you using it for Anyone have into on when and which validators will be used to get Boca chica tickets Thanks for the tip  I ll look into Solflare Looks like you can stake directly on Kraken too You can t stake on coinbase but youCan transfer to solflare or exodus and stake there I saw Marinade and it s very close to what I need  Just that they re still in testnet I had this same question to myself just a couple of days ago  I decided to keep it simple and use the Solflare wallet Please have a look at  Marinade finance  https   marinade finance   and  Steaking io  https   www steaking io  Are they what you are looking for Exodus has 6 7 Yep  bonfida simply got a grant for providing that API afaik  so they are providing it  Running a Solana validator is pretty hefty investment  so most won t do as long as they can get a way with bonfida API which I m also using btw Solflare is going to be your best bet for ease of use  but takes a long time to update  I agree with you  I wish there was something more accessible for casual users That sounds right  that the underlying source of truth is ultimately the Serum DEX  Would it be hard to query for candlestick historical data directly on chain  I assume Bonfida is doing that  and then operating their API as an  off chain   resource I should clarify  in the TradingView candlestick historical data  the data source is listed as Bonfida  The live order book may not be Doesn t have a single farm for SOL they are all using the same serum infra in the end  and bonfida is actively serving api s for multiple use cases  it doesn t have to be  source of truth   it could be just a simple frontend thingy What about SolFarm I don t think ETH can be killed Tell us about blockasset pls whats the APR   on moonlet and is it easy to use   Website says APR is up to 30  but I would like to get some close understanding on     Thanks in advance tambem quero o Questions with getting into Solana ecosystem   I want to connect my metamask wallet to use with Solana  don t want to add a different wallet    To do this all i need is the Solana RPC URL and Chain ID  What are these  Or do I need a different wallet   Can I bridge to Solana  And if so where  and can I bridge into SOL tokens  I would rather not go through Binance All sold out thou It s super buggy  let s hope they get some fixes in soon Where do they say Bonfida is their source of truth That shit my civil right as an australian you small dicked cunt Two good resources when doing your own staking 1  Best rates here     https

wrapped  BTC will hold the value of the ecosystem  just like it does for the BnB chain I think anchor makes it easier to bootstrap a basic application and provides you with a nice set of tools to speed up streamline development and testing  I spoke to a couple of DeFi developers in the Solana eco system and they highly recommended using anchor  But  like with every other framework  you can truly appreciate its benefits only when you have tried building something without using it in the first place  So I would recommend doing it the non framework way first  The hello world application and  https   break solana com   https   break solana com   are good starting points  But you need considerable rust experience to really understand the nitty gritties of it Thank you  I will make my own wallet then Try this out   https   github com vidorge solflare decrypt  https   github com vidorge solflare decrypt It worked for me Nice project Thanks for the response Seriously   there are close to 7 billion people on Earth   No more than 200 000 will ever understand what a blockchain is or how one blockchain differs from another   The survivors will have killer Dapps  low cost  good user experience  good developer experience  and competent marketing   The ones that thrive will break through to the mainstream consciousness   Eth is closest to the mainstream  but no one is in a position to occupy the entire field Don t use Coinbase I believe what you re asking is something about whether or not leaving it up to Binance to make your staking decision is bad for Solana I assume you are asking because as many people have noted  Binance pays a high returns rate for  staking  using Binance  but it s not real staking    you are not selecting a validator or validators and staking to them directly  you are instead just lending your SOL to Binance and allowing them to do whatever they want to with it  which presumably includes some staking and possibly some other actions like lending    That s why Binance  locks you  into 30   60   90 day terms when actual staking is at most a 3 day lock in The answer to your question obviously depends on exactly what Binance does   Does it make network positive staking decisions   Who knows I do believe that the network is strongest when it is not controlled by a limited number of entities  so the more that people trust their stake to a third party like Binance to control  the weaker the Solana network is 400 1k  Because it s the only Blockchain which is capable of running web scale apps worldwide  Therefore likely to be adopted  Also  How JavaScript revolutionized websites  Rust will revolutionize smart contracts and Web3  Solidity is a broken language  good for practice only North of  1000   if there s a ton of adoption between now and then  There is room for ETH and SOL  For now  ADA is a non factor  A year ago yesterday  Charles said he expected thousands of Dapps to be running on cardano in a year s time  Lol  Cardano  should  be around long term but this is much more of a position of ecosystem co existence with ETH and SOL  There is room for both and both will succeed  We ll see about cardano   1000 SOL with current supply puts cap around  270b  If SOL can achieve its potential and we assume ETH can go to the 1T range by then  this is 100  achievable no doubt  if u got in early thats whats up and all that matters Accounts  and  ownership  can get confusing because it s not explained like this An account has an  owner   This is set to the pubkey of the program that owns it  This has not related to private key ownership  The account you create for your wallet is  owned  by the system program  you  own  it only in the sense that you can sign a transaction with the pubkey to that account   which is the proof the system program requires to debit it  Token accounts also have a completely separate  owner  field as part of their data structure  This indicates the pubkey whose signiture allows debit of the token account  The pubkey of that account has no private key  it s a PDA    and the  owner  is the token program  Read that like 20 more time  and the docs 20 more times  It ll start to make sense Sorry to hear about your personal struggles  Hope you are on a good path and ofcourse with us both success with Solana SOLVED Thanks solved  Wasn t the browser  just clicked maintain beta   gt  api project serum again and it worked again  Is not my main wallet so it wasn t that bad  Thanks I was asking about total supply That doesn t mean Coinbase will let you withdraw USDC to any network I don t know what you guys talking about but it sounds high tech and I m buying more to add to my position solana is the future of DEFI My man the team has been promising ETH2 0 since 2016   Even vitalik doesnt say it will come in early 2022 like you are claiming https   tokenist com buterin explains why ethereum 2 0 upgrade wont arrive until late 2022 I never said either  but I did say I just got back into it a couple months ago after gifting everything to my brother and friend during my divorce and selling what I had to for attorney fees  so you get why I said don t give me shit but you have your opinion and I have mine  I love both but I do see ETH in trouble with ETH 2 0  especially with all these coins making their improvements as well What s the point of making a post if others can t comment    I didn t crucify you friend  Did you see me mention safemoons I m just having a discussion  I hold Solana as well I didn t put alot into it  I got in early and got my profits already  I m still holding alot but like I said  it s my lottery play  Everyone has one shitcoin whether it be safemoon  doge  Shiba  or whatever the fuck they have these days BTW   read my title again and this time remember as I said  just got back into it after a year and half of going through a divorce so don t crucify me is what I said   but I guess we skip headlines and paragraphs that go with those headlines these days 460 One toxic relationship to another It stands for Initial Dex Offering  pretty much the same as an ICO  but it s hosted on a DEX  decentralized exchange  IDO  ICO

marketcap ETH will not have good tps  i e  will not upgrade to 2 0  for sure until at least end of 2022  And even that is in huge doubt  Even if it upgrades block times are still in the order of 5 secs vs 0 5 sec of solana and fees would still be 100x of solana  while throughput  security  will be comparable  Want to accept it or not  ETH is in trouble and is being heavily outcompeted Blockchain War   ETH Killer Are narratives Youtubers and Twitter influencers made up for clicks and likes on tweets and vids   outside of these media platforms  no one knows that the fluck a blockchain is and they want this eth killer arrested 230 300 I guess we agree to disagree here What you are missing out is that the people who are willing to jump between blockchains are a tiny minority of users who have currently adopted the tech  The average guy on the street doesn t wanna switch between chains  If crypto gains mass adoption there will be a winner take all chain I m a

not being a programmer  To your knowledge  do you know   perhaps a way to explain what may possibly  be a catalyst for choosing one language over another  also   it probably is a much lower stakes scenario than people even make it out to be  could ve been a  yeah lets use that  I like the workflow  I really wanna wrap my head around how a language can not  be implemented in a certain situation  here in SOL  that would allow for the specific chain of events   or order of completion  again thank you as I am tryna learn    Cheers This statement is so evident that I have nothing to comment Definitely  it s already carving its own niche that can t be replicated on Ethereum  Serum would simply not work on it  even after Ethereum 2 0  We ll see how things progress Ill check them out   I have a loooong day at the VA tomorrow for appointments and meds   which normally takes about 7 hours for something that can be done in 2 normally  and people want free government healthcare   well you

make sense  but dethroned as the most used smart contract platform  absolutely  Why would anyone rule out that possibility I believe in 5 years buying Solana would be like buying Ethereum at  60  alot of going on here that I m just starting to read more and more about I wasn t trying to argue safemoon  lol  he asked and I mentioned it s my one shitcoin that could be something  but Solana is what I like outta all my coins dude  spare yourself and everyone an argument about safemoon lol  The important thing is you discovered Solana  Allow me to introduce you to a major MAJOR player in the future

supply means nothing when it all comes down to the circulating supply and that s what the developers were hinting at is not the total supply  But the circulating supply The coin supply burns and that s what all these functions are supposed to help accelerate it   operation Pheonix  Like I said  the community don t have the full details yet and the team said it s cause of NDAs  also with the safemoon exchange  gas fees would be used in safemoon Where the coin gets its value  For Ethereum gas fees generate profits and inflation is limited  What is the maximum supply of the coin Hi there  Thanks for pointing  it s awesome USDC  as any stablecoin  can be implemented on different networks Thank you  Finally got confirmed by them Yes apparently they do Maybe on Celsius  if you don t mind it being online  I think I saw that they support SOL  and you get interest on it too I can find the video that my brother showed me but it made sense with the math  showing it hitting  200  by end of

bullish altcoin will significantly outperform ethereum this year It s my wild card but I can share the link that made me me open minded Ive been following them since the beginning  The exchange they re coming out with gives the holders on their exchange tokenomics not only for safemoon  but for all coins traded on their platform  they have been working in the Gambia since 2018 to try to help develop that country and they have worked it out with the government to implement it as a form of currency over there  Other countries are soon to follow as they said they have a few meetings with ambassadors from a few countries in Africa  The safemoon wallet won t charge the 10  fee so it ll be just like the crypto com card with apple pay compatibility  They have talked about their crown jewel  operation Pheonix    not all the pieces are in place yet and we don t know everything but they will share when it s almost complete  wallet is coming end of July  There is alot more I can go on if you d like  I also like the team  John Karony used to be an all source analyst for the CIA and Thomas Smith is their Chief Blockchain Officer  Oh yea   they built bridges between BTC  eth  wax  and eos  they also have developed their own blockchain as well  I mean alot of promise but I m not putting all my eggs in one basket ya know gt BTC will hold at least half of the value of the ecosystemWe are under 50  already Real competition is good for the industry What makes you think they ll over take eth ADA is pretty much focused on smart contracts right now ADA is ADA is I can t    I was talking about Ethereum without direct comparison to Solana What is so special about Safemoon I mean   I think I did good in choosing the quality of the projects with highest upside   shit  I could even put in an excellent argument for safemoon   but I m realistic and I like to keep my bags spread  You really like Dexa It will change when the ETH maxis realize there is no point in being a maxi anymore  For now they are behaving like they want to be the one blockchain to rule them all   the comparison with Sauron can only inspire people to want to kill it I dont know  should you  It was my honest to god best guess should I find that funny My best prediction is  0    900000  Anything outside that range seems pretty unlikely gt Thanks man  Can t wait for the Vue one I personally don t think Cardano has much of a future  Never know  never say never  Yeah  I agree  I dislike that term as well  mainly because it s pretty much meaningless  I mean  say something with more substance   what you d actually mean  Give us details  etc If adoption come  blockchains like Solana and Elrond will take a lot of dev attention only for the language you can build with  Cardano works with Haskell and Eth with solidity  having blockchains that works with way more famous programming languages will help in the long term with adoption  Another big issue of Solana is decentralization  big corporations might have problems with that and prefer more decentralized projects  But we ll see  ‍ ️ I would argue compared to raw pointer access  borrowing in rust is quite a magic bullet but you are free to do cpp dev ofc As a developer it killed Eth for me    I cannot willingly and morally build on Eth under the current situation   1  Eth is easier to build on  but the speed and problems that plague it  front running etc  are just too big to ignore with Solana existing2  Why would I consciously expose my clients and customers to such exorbitant gas fees Yes it s a slightly steeper learning curve than what we are used to  but ultimately how many more opportunities will we get to get in on the ground floor of such transformative projects    Learning Solana today is like learning iOS programming from the first iPhone or  to bring it full circle  learning Ethereum in 2015 I agree  the learning curve is much steeper than Solidity  But once you get over that first hump  it s not too bad imo Bullshit reasons overall Hello s il vous plaît comment faire pour transférer mets kin Hello s il vous plaît comment faire pour transférer mets kin I know this is old  but we are going through a bear market  I see STEP going back up at the end of it  As with Solana  RAY  and other crypto I know this is old  but we are going through a bear market  I see STEP going back up at the end of it  As with Solana  RAY  and other crypto I know this is ole  but we are going through a bear market  I see STEP going back up at the end of it  As with Solana  RAY  and other crypto Well for LP s you get a cut of the trading fees on AMM s  Farming one currency is  staking   You usually get significantly less because the risks are much smaller  You can straight up stake sol on your wallet probably depending on which you use but it doesn t pay much Didnt think that was possible   I Cant send USDC to sollet wallet   Doesnt let me when I paste my wallet in   thought CB USDC was erc 20 Amazing guide   we wanted to add that you can also use  solstake io  https   solstake io  to stake your SOL with whichever validators you choose  Our team have been working hard since the Solana Hackathon on providing a way to connect ANY Solana wallet to stake rather than being limited  to a few wallets only  Give us a spin FTX not available in New York Oh wow that is horrible   you should contact  aeyakovenko on Twitter and let him know Agree  i think  Solana or any fastest blockchain can only overtake Ethererum when it has more useful dapps and most active developer community  Most of BSC projects are rugpul or useless or meme   Solana has so much dev activity  but time will tell whether sol dapps will be useful and solve problems and get general public Thanks  just took a look   pretty good thread  I just finished  roughly  understanding the hello world example and the basic programming model  Do you think learning anchor is worth it  I was going to try and not use any frameworks for a little while so I don t miss out on any details gt 000 into an initial coin offering or promising young coin and hope to hwhy not FTX You can take a look at my running thread here  https   twitter com karthikkalyan90 status 1394805514840596482 s 21Am also in the same boat learning to build on Solana If you are actually a good programmer  modern C is a great way to go  IMO Rust is a lot of boiler plate to solve a problem that doesn t exist  The only people writing unsafe code in C are going to write garbage code in Rust anyway Go to FTX  Way better exchange for SPL backed projects Lol at thinking Ethereum is anywhere close to mainstream and can t die  I fail to see what niche Eth would have if Solana is successful  Maybe people who like to pay higher fees with lower tx speed would still be using Ethereum out of charity 300 3k 300 3k Sending from Coinbase  not Pro  to Sollet wallet address worked fine for me I think solana is the safest bet in crypto  So most of my weight is in solana  Serum is a bit risky  not a huge fan of their tokenomics but i trust Sam bankman fried  so I own a decent amount   Good luck 10 or  10 000  No in between 10 or  10 000  No in between I don t know of any easy way to tell this info  but you can do it by knowing that all epochs are 432 000 blocks long and using the  solana block time  command line tool For example       solana block time    95 432000      Block  41040000    Date  2020 10 12T14 08 43ZHere we have the beginning of epoch 95   Of course it ended when epoch 96 began       solana block time    96 432000      Block  41472000    Date  2020 10 14T07 50 55ZOne wrinkle  sometimes the first block of an epoch is skipped  and you ll have to keep adding 1 to the block number until you find the first block in the epoch
2021-07-06,32.93030657,34.97831874,32.93030657,I mean solana fees are already so low there s hardly any reason to even use the discount lol I don t know  because I m looking at it right now and it says 11 62 Someone is downvoting comments in this topic that give truthful information about Kraken    That s pretty lame gt Up to 60  off fees  80  of DEX feeWhere and how I can take advantage of these discount offers Moonlet s APY is actually 7 30  over the past 30 days   Not sure where people keep getting this 11 62  number from  it s not accurate Hi  Thanks  I understand the importance of serum  My question is  what you can do with the serum  token I d love to see a SOLANA   Fantom   Polygon Bridge That was exactly the problem  I tried to stake all my SOL but forgot to separate the 0 00005 SOL needed for the gas   If developers can change the error message  that would be great for the dapp Thanks I like both  Tons of dapps are going to be built on serum  So far  raydium is the best app using serum You have an it s ok  I was once like you    Serum is a powerhouse  maybe not now  but should solana grow all money on solana will move through serum  There are many AMMs in crypto  such as uniswap  pancake swap  raydium  but there is only one central limit order book  serum  in crypto  There s a reason why they chose solana to build it on  it s the only blockchain that s can power a CLOB  You can think of serum like a octopus  any app connected to it will gain access to its liquidity and in return serum can lend that liquidity to another app   We call this composability  that s why you can get tight spreads on raydium because should the pool fail it will just route the order to serum and get the closest bid  As solana grows so will serum to the point where the burns out pace the unlocks  Should serum reach its full potential it can host Nasdaq like application  I made a post about this here  https   www reddit com r solana comments nkroc9 for_those_wondering_whether_raydium_vs_serum  utm_source share amp utm_medium ios_app amp utm_name iossmf From the serum website Serum Token Up to 60  off fees 80  of DEX fees go to SRM buy  amp  burns 20  of DEX fees go to SRM stakers What are the advantages of Solana over Ethereum  Over Polkadot  Over Cardano  Seems many are trying to do the same things If  t be true t didst   I m pulling up in a lambo xd     I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout If it did  I m pulling up in a lambo xD Ethereum No serum doesn t have a front end  It s all backend  Your response only tells me you haven t learned enough about it  Once you do  your mind will be unlocked and you ll see it s full potential   Think of serum as the plumbing of Solana  You never worry about water in your life because it works but there is pipes and plumbing that moves that water That s how serum is  When you use raydium you are actually using serum on the backend  to an extent LoL learn about zksync  ethereum will make solana irrelevant Also i have been investigating serum today  and for some reason all token exchange and adding liquidity is not working  and the message in the top of the site says to use raydium  so i guess the answer is obvious Could you please add the time to validate a transaction  I ve been looking for the data but I can t find it   Also a list of applications that don t care about the latency of the transaction time  I have a feeling a very large percentage of transactions are OK with more than 10 seconds of transaction confirmation time  Not sure of the actual average transaction time  based this comment on the available data I could find https   raydium gitbook io raydium exchange trade and swap liquidity pools If you stake at least 50 100 Ray on Raydium  you can take part in IDO lottery  AcceleRaytor  If you keep at least 200 COPE in your wallet  you ll receive free airdrops every now and then I have yet to find a reason to buy Serum Look for impermanent loss If u can pls write me what is this risks  or maybe u have link On Any DEX  But you need some crypto to start with  You can t do it with fiat Use FTX  It gives 10  and I think it will keep giving more than most for a long time Adding liquidity to SOL usdc pool on raydium is good but do only if you understand it  You might get 30 50  average APY but check the related risks Moonlet   11 62  APY currently   Link to your Ledger Nano   There are several validators on Moonlet you can stake with aside from the Moonlet node as well I m so sorry  don t saw it  my bad  thank you I m happy to hold 10    2  Wish i bought more I think we should work on building a great ecosystem  tools  and community and the price will take care of itself spl token accounts  worked  so long as your keypair file is in     config solana id json Thanks Anytime friendo  Good luck Exodus supports a few coins for staking  SOL ADA NEO VET ONT Thank you  glad you liked it Ok so what ur saying is to not bother with raydium and instead invest in the backbone behind it all Raydium uses limit orders on the Serum dex backend That should basically answer your question If not Serum is the heartbeat of Solana If not Crap Just take a look at Sams eyes and fall in love Realistic prediction  200  by 2025 1000  by 2031Unless eth screw up big time  with their upgrade to eth 2 0  That will be a game changer   and solana have a big chance of replacing eth then   in my opinion they are next in line to take the blockchain throne in that case  Cardano is to slow This is an exaggeration  SOL would only have to reach the current market cap of ETH  or a little better   This is definitely possible given that ADA is   1 5 the market cap of ETH already I m not sure Solana would be my choice if I had to pick one coin though If I were to pick the coin with the best risk reward metric  I would pick an EVM coin that has established DeFi products and a much lower market cap  There are several Agree 100 There will likely be multiple coins in the top 20 with over a trillion in market cap in the next 4 5 years  I believe Solana will be one of them It s possible but there will have to be several viral dApps on the network before I think that ll be a realistic possibility  The market itself will have to be a lot higher  It ll probably also have to replace ETH as the go to smart contract protocol  If we got some of that ETH money then hell yea Eth is considered one of the more secure blockchains The spl token command can do this https   spl solana com token Serum  but you need some other crypto asset to trade first  like usdc Can you develop on this please  I m about to start and would love a walkthrough to be sure I m doing it good First where do you buy the SOL from so you don t pay to much fee transferring to your wallet  FTX I ve succeeded in connecting the wallet to Solfarm ioWhat pool shall I chose RAY SOL LP  What are you doing with RAY token after  You add SOL to put it back in the pool with the RAY earned Thanks in advance for taking time to answers Do you have some SOL in your Wallet  like 0 1 If that didn t solve the problem  here is    SolFlare Telegram Support Group    https   t me SolFlare_Wallet Someone has jokes Not again  Stop with all the exclamation points  Take that over to the doge area Staking  with an exchange like binance is not really staking   It s just lending your tokens to an exchange for them to do with what they want   You can do it  just please be aware that it s not the same thing as staking Your question was basically asked and answered yesterday https   www reddit com r solana comments oe9p2i which_are_the_best_validators_for_staking_solana I have been programming extensively in ETH   Solidity for 3  years now  Solidity can still be useful for learning basic DAPP programming concepts but I don t think it   or ETH   is where the future is going I have done some basic Solana programming and it is conceptually quite a bit different than other blockchains  Feels quite a bit more like a message passing architecture to me TBH  But the unique architecture is also what gives Solana its extreme speed and scalability If you re struggling a bit with Rust I recommend you take a look at the excellent Substrate   Ink  tutorial here   https   substrate dev substrate contracts workshop   0 introduction  https   substrate dev substrate contracts workshop   0 introduction Ink  is Substrate   Parity s approach to smart contracts but is basically just a powerful Rust macro framework Don t get me wrong   I m a huge fan of Solana   and   Substrate   Polkadot  I think they ll both be equally successful because they have strengths in different areas and use cases Lol it s already been over  50    If you say so    Your right It s not going above  50 this year  This run is over Generally not advised   Kraken has very poor returns  6 5   and they are custodial  they own your tokens while you are  staked  with them thanks for the explaining this I own a significant chunk of sol but my main concern is around it s tokenomics  It s an inflationary coin and with extremely low fees  I m worried that the burn rate will not counteract it s staking rewards and infinite distribution  I trust the team will figure it out but pointing out that the technology benefits can be a double edged sword İ take less risk from doge holder  more risk from btc holder  Solana has looong long way to go i belive   Btc already gone   İ hope u get my point  Sorry for my english  it isnt my main language You don t want to diversify into some less risky projects  also with attractive returns  like bitcoin Also  as far as crypto goes  highly centralized  It ll have its purposes  though  Don t get me wrong You can send Eth to a sollet wallet from metamask and it will convert it for you to SOL  I think you can load up Eth on metamask without KYC https   serum academy com en serum dex sol wallet I agree with this  I m invested in quite a few smart contract coins right now  and I ve participated in the ecosystem on most of them  Solano feels pretty far behind I don t like how the article leaves out most of the competition  It compared Solana with XRP and ETH  but it leaves out the other cryptos that have very good settlement times and TPS like FTM  ATOM  and ONE  Some of these use use the EVM too  so they offer a drop in and ready made infrastructure for Defi protocols  Given the competition and the incomplete feel of Solana  I feel like it s a bit overvalued right now But who knows  ETH shot up like a rocket after the last bear market  Solana may be next Just saw that Solana is not on KuCoin  It only has Solana Futures but not spot trading support for Solana 1st problem Marketing  nobady knows solana  ADA is 10 times more know because of tis marketing  Marketing is key Yeah overall   but the 7 day and 14 day can match it and those are when you coins do parabolic moves      Look at the history of the last bull run    That s where you start      Dyor  lol That s completely fair  I did enjoy the article by the way  Good job on it That is a bad comparison  These companies profit from the internet  It is their entire business  Bitcoin is worth nothing if a single party can control it That s fair and legit  Personally  I use both  but in this thought experiment  the circulating supply was the relevant one IMO Interesting idea UPDATE   ITS RESOLVED   CHECK MY ORIGINAL POST FOR SOLUTION wow  this reddit is just an echo chamber  Everyone wants to believe in Solana  DIncluding me however   ultimately in my opinion the key to price point is adoption  Without exposition solana has poor chances to become anything more than a nerd coin  Everyone knows BTC  some people know about ETH  Monero is sometimes in the news as the coin for mexican drug cartels to launder money  D  rest   is non existent in peoples minds  Ask your dad or mom if he heard about Solana and BTC Tech is one thing  but without exposition and adoption we wont have price  IMHO this is where Solana creators fail miserably as there is no PR and education action many  good guys  including google  amazon  facebook  many chinese companies have enough power to take down the internet or vast portions of it  have they  would they  we can also have this discussion about nukes If it happened  I would be a very happy man Very Possible I get what you re saying but if any additional coins being released has impact on the price then the price is just wrong   In my extreme example adding one extra token would halve the price   If you owned that one coin today and they released a new coin tomorrow  losing 50  means it was priced too high  The circulating market cap is used on those sites but my point is that its meaningless You should look at the supply of coins that hasn t been released yet as coins that someone owns but hasn t remembered their password yet  They still exist  but we just don t have access to them yet  but when we do it shouldn t impact the price of everything You re right that coins will be burned but overall I think that s relatively small   in the grand scheme of things  and using total supply is just better IMO Welcome  this is a good post to read  https   www reddit com r solana comments nfefwf the_complete_beginners_guide_to_solana_sol_the Coinex I wish Sorry that is what I meant  that your yield is in RAY  I do the same but was wondering was there a v2 or something where you could get paid in SOL It is a good question  I m inclined to answer yes  but it would depend on the planned distribution of the rest of the tokens I guess Or  more precisely  I would say yes to the question you re asking  but I sure as hell wouldn t buy it  given the huge amount of tokens to be distributed Also  the calculated market capitalization on websites like  coinmarketcap com  https   coinmarketcap com  and  coingecko com  https   coingecko com   as well as all exchanges I ve ever used are calculating the MC using the circulating supply I guess this might be the conclusion When calculating the current value of a token  the circulating supply is appropriate to use  However  when calculating the future price of a token  one must take into consideration the inflation of the circulating supply  In the end  at least in most cases  the circulating supply will be equal to the  fully diluted  supply  However  many projects burn tokens  making things a bit more complicated No  you add Sol and Raydium together to create an LP      It pays well too  in Raydium tokens Kucoin When you say farming it on Raydium  do you mean farming RAY then swapping to SOL Hmm not sure I agree the circulating market cap actually has any meaning really If it did then if there was one SOL in circulation you would believe it could get to a  288bn coin value  despite the fact that there a millions more coins yet to be released Swap on Raydium FTX US let s you do it without KYC   There are lower limits but you can do it Oh  Looks like you are correct  Phantom is just a wallet Thanks for all of your replies We have to think I trillion dollar market caps indeed  It seems insane  But yeah if 300  600 billion in value is locked  Why not  Crazy shit  Seems obvious in hindsight  Just like eth and Btc Absolutely   without a doubt  but it will probably take a couple years  Long on Solana  just keep buying and farming it on Raydium   and staking it on Solflare It s already up 4 700  in the past year  That s about as good as it s going to get lol Changelly Honestly this run is over  It s going to mess around and bounce up and down for another couple months but it will be plummeting in the next couple months i agree with you except my portfolio  100 solana unlike ur  3 I think it is a question of time  it is a great projekt cool  thanks  just found  dog of wisdom  your teacher I m a dev as well  not crypto  and I love using libraries with great community support It can do it    The last bull run gave on an average  of 10x and some went a 1000x   With the market cap decently low and the supply very low comparing anything is possible I ve tried many many times  always the same incomprehensible error  Any help Thanks for your advice Ethereum has tons of institutional interest  but I get your point  I think it ll happen within either this or the next cycle  1 year or 3 4 That is a nice rule of thumb  and I agree in principle  However  in this case  I used it to compare to other market caps calculated using their circulating supply  But yeah  one should calculate both when considering possible pricetargets  That is a nice rule of thumb  and I agree in principle  However  in this case  I used it to compare to other market caps calculated using their circulating supply  But yeah  one should calculate both when considering possible price targets HelloCan you Restore your MathWalelt Wallet into Sollet  If yes  there might be a way to restore that SOL laying into your USDC address Head to    Serum Discord    https   discord gg EDvudv6           FAQ    https   discord com channels 739225212658122886 839714556808003584  channel  amp  you ll see this  gt Q  I accidently sent SOL to my token address  What do I do    gt    gt A  One can get the sol back from their token address by deleting the token account  Read the answer to  How do I delete a duplicate account   All the same warnings apply  amp  x200B   PS  read the instructions carefully  YES i tried that myself in Sollet  amp  it works Bitrue has it I do agree with you that it s possible  I m a Solana holder and big believer in it s potential One thing though is that when doing market cap valuations you should use the fully diluted market cap  There is 272 million coins in circulation  which gives your 272 billion market cap  but you have to use the max supply which is 488 million coins and such a 488 billion market cap at  1000  Still very feasible but just something to note  You can fall into a trap sometimes if you don t and end up with prices with market caps in the trillions Yes  Eth reached this level and it s an inferior technology and has been unable to attract instituations due to its  scaling  security issues  Solana can definitely achieve it  The only question is when  It will take another 2 3 years I would imagine and would very much depend on how many partners they can get onboard No If Bitcoin goes up 10 15x then Solana have the potential to reach the 1000 Correct  In the blog post  I linked to at the bottom of the post I ve got a comparison of the expected MC of Bitcoin at  100K and Ethereum at  8K  and Solana at  1000  It looks healthy imo Yeah  it currently needs to pull a 25x to reach  1000  That might be too much for this cycle  but I think it s realistic in the next one for sure If you really think about it  even  2000 or above is possible  Global markets are in the hundreds of trillions in value even taking 1  of that capital would put Solana at  2000   It is most definitely possible  if you truly believe crypto will take significant market share  10T  total crypto MC EDIT   1000 would put it about where Ethereum was a few months ago MC wise I d say we are two bull runs away  Next bull run in 2024 2025 should hopefully see  250  500 and then the next bitcoin halving which is what 2028 that s when it s got a shot  I mean anything is possible I m just trying to keep buying The simple truth is  I didn t think anyone would take it seriously Well I searched on solanabeach at first but did not find the info   Can you tell me where Cardano Damn  Be careful mate  Youre human after all  Dont crash and burn The NFT market on Solana will be massive Cool  Can t wait until we start getting game NFTs  The one issue with NFT art is the lack of a use case  It s just an image that you pay for  But I respect the drive to put crypto to use and get it circulating in the ecosystem yeah juggling this on top of a full time job and a business   some side project   helping a mate out with his car engine build  R32 gtr if anyone is a petrol head  and then a kid too lol   wheeeeeee The value   lt path to my fs keypair gt   should reference the output keypair file from creating a filesystem wallet as described  here in their docs  https   docs solana com wallet guide file system wallet generate a file system wallet keypair  Been a few days since you posted  Did you already figure it out See  the thing is that some people who are new to programming might take you seriously  so why are you trolling Tokenized  next big _____ Ahh  expensive mistake  But oh well  youll survive that  Make sure to get enough sleep though bro  And drink water and dont forget to eat   Speaking as someone who has experienced burnout  You dont want it couldn t agree more its a pain in the ass hehehe took one for the team lol   only 74 SOL nowt major its just the fact i dropped a tit due to my own tiredness   lesson learnt   spinning many plates at the min hehe Woah woah woah  You re talking to me like I don t know what I just said  HTML is actually the best language for programming anything  Did you know NASA super computers actually run on HTML  Teslaa even uses HTMLs in their rockets because it s more efficient  HTMLs literally run the large hadron collider because it s so good  Please don t insult my intelligence like that ever again Pretty sure you didn t   A dapp needs a frondend and a backend  the backend is the smart contract  You cannot write a smart contract with HTML  You also cannot build a frontend that can interact with smart contracts without Javascript I have the same fear of doing what you did  Manually copy pasting addresses in crypto leaves so much room for error  I get nervous every time I move it around  We definitely need a better system for it If you re comparing languages alone  Rust is leagues ahead of solidity  and used as a modern fast systems language outside of blockchain dev  If you re not going to transfer these programming skills to other areas  like web dev  DevOps  business intelligence etc  then it s more of a decision based on your faith of what you imagine will be the more dominant dapp platform in the future  Personally I think neither and that application layers on top of the stable bitcoin layer 1 are the future and therefore LAPP development is more interesting to me  but your choice Looks like you just burned some of the circulating supply bro  Thanks  But sorry for you bro  How much lost Well  we live and we learn  I suppose yeah the annoying thing is when i did it TO binance i DID do that   and in a moment of tiredness i just yeeted the whole thing over to mathwallet without testing it first   my own fault doh thanks fella   yeah heres hoping but if its gone ah well lol I would argue that not everyone holds shitcoins lol lol its not like i m any kind of whale lol  i wish     but I ll be ok though if this doesn t work out and there s no way to get it back  contacted Solana to ask    as we all know   never invest what you cant afford to lose   lesson learned on my side   dont swap numbers tired lol  glad it aint my XRP bag Also  it s a good habit to send a small amount first as you re adding the address to the address book  You might incur double the trx fees  but it s nothing compared to the potential loss Shit  Ok man well I wish u the best of luck   we all kno that normally it s lost forever   BUT in this case I do believe there s a chance given the fact it is in the right blockchain and it s to your own address   i really hope so man yeah i contacted Binance as thats where i sent it from and they said the tx completed   at least on their end so they have no part in it now  I ve contacted Solana to see if they can help   mathwallet were no use lol  thanks     ant Yes sir Ok this also sounds good  more like any big serum trade Yes there is a channel on YouTube called runforthecube and it taught me everything I know 74 sol  not a large amount by any means  OK You know what   I don t feel so bad anymore cool  any resources please Good bot I gotta admit Hmmm maybe big Sol Purchases   If that s possible  Show us  Very bullish sign if a      is in the vacinity It s possible that it never left your wallet  Try disconnecting entirely from the internet like rebooting your comp or phone  I once sent out of exodus  it was sol to sol tho  and it never showed up   apparently it never actuslly left my wallet   did a reboot and it was back inside without having been sent   But the transcetikn hash that u linked does say complete so idk I wrote all my Dapps on html I don t know either language  but if your learning this for a career  I d learn Solidity first  achieve mastery of that  and then learn Rust as then you ll have the benefit of knowing how the two differ in structure and approach  Basically you could pick rust and learn that first  but likely there will be more employment opportunities if you re good with solidity as the bulk of smart contract work is done in that language it makes it easier to get paid for your skill update on this mathwallet got back with  ask Solana Official for help    lovely and no use at all   does anyone know what they mean by that   Telegram or something    I tried the website but there is no support chat or anything Pick the one with better community support thankyou   yeah i read it on reddit and the chap said it worked so i m hopeful   if mathwallet would reply to my email that would be a start dang  really https   explorer solana com tx 3rBqj9jhJZj6CNGFttACgaFTFj7WtVeBtXJLHACJn7ya7cgFM5jCM1mUwsHsXJ2q8Hxu4NFxkZmcQZVWkZ8wMUpv  https   explorer solana com tx 3rBqj9jhJZj6CNGFttACgaFTFj7WtVeBtXJLHACJn7ya7cgFM5jCM1mUwsHsXJ2q8Hxu4NFxkZmcQZVWkZ8wMUpv   thats the txid from binance   does that help   I think its a SOL type address but i m not sure on how to access the keys to access the sol yeah i was using binance website on my computer to do it   it didn t give me any erros in addresses yeah i emailed  hello mathwallet org  mailto hello mathwallet org  as the website said to contact them with support issues but no reply as yet   at the end of the day it IS  in  my mathwallet as such    the SOL got sent into my USDC wallet on my mathwallet so i m hoping they might be able to do something   like you say revert a transaction or something   If not rekt lol F That is really unfortunate  I sadly am not aware of a way you could possibly recover the funds other than getting in touch with Mathwallet and specifying the owner of the token contract  7xFHSKy4aCq5YdsUhdFpFb7ayrHw9QHHadB3EzsfX9YE   On Ethereum token contracts there sometimes is some logic in place to automatically revert your transaction Aren t you using the main binance website  I noticed that they had a new update where it tells you if the recipient s address is a correct address for that blockchain  Binance US probably don t have this update Again  was it a SOL type address or an ETH type address  Either way  it seems mathwallet does give you the keys so you should be able to access the sol on mathwallet i have SOL and USDC  on binance i sent SOL to the USDC address on my mathwallet instead of the address for SOL   a retarded moment of tiredness     I ll be plenty fine   not a killer amount    74 SOL   just a bit annoying because it was such a silly mistake 74 SOL is 60  higher than average salary in the country I live in If sollet wallet allowed them to recover this then it has to be possible  it s not as tho the other wallet functions with independent blockchain rules right    I don t personally kno how but if someone really has sent sol to USDC and got it back  then if I were you I would not give up Bc thre has to be a way  First verify the Sollet wallet story if I were u  Best of luck yup   F for fick lol F 74 SOL   not a large amount by any means but would have bought me some new rear brakes for my car   that was gonna be the plan lol its a USDC address on my mathwallet   normally i would send it to the SOL address on that wallet but in a tired moment i copy pasted the bloody USDC address on that same wallet which isn t the same     you can see it here   74 SOL   not a blazing amount i ll be plenty fine but its still no fun to lose lol     https   explorer solana com tx 3rBqj9jhJZj6CNGFttACgaFTFj7WtVeBtXJLHACJn7ya7cgFM5jCM1mUwsHsXJ2q8Hxu4NFxkZmcQZVWkZ8wMUpv What is the USDC address you have send it to Wait  their ETH USDC address or what  SOL and ETH addresses are quite different so you cant really send one to the other If the USDC Sol address   as a wallet and not an exchange don t you just own the key to the address  Can you see the SOL when you check the address in explorer Hope the amount was too large yep   it sucks balls   i was kinda hoping it would be possible due to the sollet wallet being able to do it   this sucks     i ll add the address into an address book next time ta RIP   I feel your loss brother I am afraid there is no ways to retrieve funds sent to wrong address I have seen many such cases in reddit  My advise going forward is add addresses manually inside address book  that will save you from sending out to wrong addresses Moonlet io does not pay 11    It pays 7 32  over the past 30 days or so Source  https   stakeview app So  should we take what you say as plain truth  amp  that s it  amp  We should consider Raj a scammer    The Co Founder  amp  COO at Solana   SCAMMED   you in 4k   That make sense I ll lock the thread for a while before deleting it just to let people see how naif your arguments are Thanks for sharing this  I use Binance I would say he s the most   flexible   guy to answer any question you have in mind about Solana  so what you re saying is just irrelevant  amp  totally inaccurate I stake all my SOL with FTX for 10   though it s custodial with a 7 day withdrawal period Zanetzu is a Troll  In discord he feel brave and kick people if he dislike their question  Here now he can cry   so stop stealing from people Well to ban people after taking their money instead to fix your mess won t solve anything  Just here you can t ban You came to Discord to spam the same message   I have no problem with letting a single complaint stand but you kept repeating yourself and would not stop   That is why you were banned It s very unlikely that you will get any response on reddit or Discord   If you think you have been scammed  you should contact law enforcement in your area I ll check them out later  Good tips RajGokal I was donating 4000  to your anti Covid campaign for India  After Mr RajGokal took my money and he disappeared and started to ghost me  The promised NFT I never received  After sending many messages and a month of silence I decided to share it public  So I just want let everybody know how shady  RajGokal is  In front he try to be a nice guy but is scam Thanks for sharing  I already found something Marinade finance launching soon and Solstake io Huh  That s    odd I know a lot of people have suggested Exodus and Kraken here  but I want to give you a little tip  Exodus and Kraken both delegate your staked SOL to a validator with pretty high fees  and one that already have a substantial stake  It s not really helping the network  and its not really helping yourself either because there are better performing vaildators out there  Solflare is great because you can pick your own validator  You can also use https   stakeview app to see which validators perform best on an epoch to epoch basis  I know you said you wanted something easy and user friendly  but I thought I d chime in with my two cents at least Yope  Thanks Yeah  I got them  Thanks Okay  Thanks for sharing Yeah  I m currently staked on Binance  Looking for something less custodial Well  I didn t mention in the post that I don t really wanna stake SOL  Just looking for where to earn decent yield on it Staking  does not mean earring yield  and a staking is not done on any DEX  How do so many people know know what staking actually means   across many crypto subs Sorry I have never even used solflare  I really need to try it out just so that I can provide more competent help to people Does Fantom support staking   It s not an option I am familiar with Solflare I believe has good staking options but you have to either use a hardware ledger or accept that it stores your key in a file  and I would recommend manually managing that file for security  i e  store it somewhere safe  only copy it to an internet connected computer for the duration of using solflare  then delete it  keeping a safe copy elsewhere of course  until using solflare again  I hope that some better staking options will come online soon   There are many in the works from what I understand Using ledger  I hav my sol stakin on exodus and recently got a trezor to find Eth and Btc are the only compatable coins  So forget about staking  Il be heading to solflare soon  unless anyone knows how i can stake from sollet Have you heard of Steaking io launches July 15th Try Binance and sol staked there gets you 9 1 This is awesome thank you FTX is pretty much also easy to use Moonlet Which should I stake through  Solflare or Fantom Thanks Token starts from 0 025 for seed investors  Ido will be 0 03 Heyhey  I m implementing the SPL token price tracker  I ll release it this week sometime  Thanks for the tip Do you have any other ideas which might be good to add to the bot This week I will also release a new version with SPL token price tracking    do you have any ideas what else might be good to add Send to Kraken and stake there We love Shinobi Systems   By the way  I could not delegate via Solflare    ERROR  Failed to send transaction etc etc  This is all starting Any help i ve been on SolFlare for a while  no complaints Wow  11    I need to look into that  I sent to Kraken to stake until my Ledger arrives and I think it s 4 6 Thanks for the input ALL I stake on Exodus Wallet Moonlet or solflare  Exodus if you don t care about maximum staking rewards this is dpe as alas thank thee mine own sir shall donate        I am a bot and I swapp d some of thy words with Shakespeare words  Commands    ShakespeareInsult     fordo     optout this is dpe as fuck thank you my man will donate Doesn t exodus minimize rewards by delegating to a single validator what average or below average staking rewards compared to if you choose your own validators through a different wallet How does this video relate to Solana I mean no one holds eth or btc to stake it yet  Speculation for btc  Utility speculation for eth Solana already shows crazy ability for dexes and other defi ideas  It could also function as a legit payment system just for day to day stuff  As things get more fleshed out on the defi side it ll become a lot more obvious why it ll go up Yes  it costs about  20 000 per year   With enough stake it can be profitable though Yes Exodus is a poor staking choice for three reasons  1   They are too large already  as the  2 validator by stake weight   No one should be adding stake to a validator that is already that large  2   They have very mediocre to poor returns  3   Their staking solution does not allow the end user to select validators to stake with   That is inexcusable and does users and solana itself a great disservice I listened to a bankman fried Solana ceo convo and they were talking a lot about bridges  I think there will be a good amount of options in the future Sol makes too much sense as a platform for a top tier dex  I imagine a future where I turn all my eth into wEth on Solana and invest it into other things I m an EE and work in hardware and can do a bit with that stack but probably not enough to get a job  I just wanted to say I tried your wallet and really liked it Kraken stakes   6 5 Eth will slowly upgrade though  It would need a complete overhaul to do what Solana is doing but don t discount popularity and name recognition Like why does Bitcoin have any value  Because people know Bitcoin  That s all it takes sometimes I purchase on Coinbase  send to Moonlet  which can also use Ledger Nano X   and then stake there for 11 I feel like eth has the benefits of some more tried and true defi projects and will probably be more stable price wise than Solana  Solana at some point in the near future will pump hard and drop So it might make sense to keep your savings in eth if you believe in it and use something like polygon or whatever they re developing to transfer funds into Solana for better defi and dexes Geez  how many subs are you going to spam this on Thanks  I ll check it out https   solstake io I don t think so  At least not anytime soon  I do think Solana in the short term could for sure replace BNB and a lot of the cheaper eth alternatives and be used as one of the main cryptos Exodus is a great and easy option for staking SOL Imagine using Kraken after they Liq d everyone on ETH drop after their API broke LOL What s your risk profile looking like   If high risk  then go for an up and coming project that guarantees high returns      guarantees are never 100  though    I d honestly opt for something like Exodus but I d urge you to do your research  even on well established wallets  That being said  the biggest decision is really whether to HODL something cool  stake it  or BOTH  if you re lucky     GL hF    PS  Never put more in than you re willing to lose Awesome thanks for the info  Is it expensive running a validator
