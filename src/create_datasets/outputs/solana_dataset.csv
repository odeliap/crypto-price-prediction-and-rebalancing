2021-01-03,1.79990169,2.36498131,1.79990169,ALGO dumped that way because they had a completely fucked price guarantee upfront  It allowed big market makers and hedge funds to bid it up like crazy in the initial auction  dump it on retail  and then claim the price guarantee for themselves a year later when the price was below the auction  Retail was quite literally left holding the bags of an incredibly inflated initial price  where the ALGO team hadn t thought through the dynamics of their price guarantee  or worse  were complicit  SOL on its first run up at listing reached heights of about  0 80  During the dump afterward  the team stabilized the network  and racked up a ton of partnerships  The Serum announcement and DeFi summer was what sent it up to around  5 at the peak  followed by a drop as this unlock drew nearer  With the unlock out of the way  if there is not a significant dump  both SOL and SRM will be pretty unstoppable SOL team got a lot of flack over the last year for lack of transparency  but they came out of the gates with no floor to their auction right in the middle of the COVID lockdowns starting  and got a lot of people very rich who bought in at  0 22 in what seemed like a pretty fair  unmanipulated auction  SOL is now extremely undervalued and the team has done very little to overpump the price  That s why it s 1 10 the marketcap of Polkadot  But that won t last for very long  IMO

2021-02-02,4.6137412,5.40364154,4.48011942,Thanks a lot for your time and answers  I will update it as a FAQ  Although there are some things that I still do not udnerstand like   1k is the current load  it means there are no more transactions going on than 1k   Thats why we never have the cance to see on the website 50k TPS The wallet I used for the test of SOLANA was BINANCE which they are as you said temproarily and not a proper wallet jsut the trader service  If more wallets did use SOLANA I would test it further Validators then use only virtual nodes and do not relay on the hardware  But how does provide the Leaders then  amp  x200B thanks so much
2021-02-03,5.24659151,5.78078094,5.07273844,https   www stablecoinwatch comI built a site to track the issuance of stablecoins on different blockchains Will update it to include the new issuance of Usdt on Solana this weekend

2021-02-19,8.97997007,11.68057695,8.5569807,Bad UI  not clear how much you are earning  things are not working smoothly  things just dont work from time to time   You want tech to look good  provide you with a clear overview of what is going on and just work  So far what is available for SOL is failing at the basics
2021-02-20,11.47808705,11.78673714,9.81585439,Those are reserved for foundation in Switzerland  validator awards and project awards  project bounties etc This is a big project based in silicon Valley I wouldn t worry much about those as most of those coins are at coinbase custody
2021-02-21,9.98755024,11.64028854,9.88704665,Yea it s pretty dead in here
2021-02-22,11.07303597,14.5456406,9.25590402,So it s a massive amount of data   Do a search for a collocation data center in your local city  call them and check the cost of unmetered 1gbps  200mbps is the current load   Setup a node and sign up for tds and earn a grant This is a pia  and that s just part of life   The only thing that is equivalent to PoW security is just a ton of messages which means bandwidth
2021-02-23,14.42162567,15.74337116,11.59989436,Why are people having different results  Are there different versions of Nano S
2021-02-24,15.2138421,18.14662172,14.86179947,My point by point response a  I discount this one because the code is open source  which is what matters at the end of the day  Documentation is great  but frequently does not match the actual code  Each crypto project is its own bug bounty program for black hat hackers  There is plenty of incentive for them to look for weaknesses in Solana  b Can you point to evidence of  specific endpoints that most users have to go through  c Took a quick look at the code base and did not find any reference to slashing  could you point to the placeholder to which you refer d This one is a concern for me  Their inflation system is complicated and thus difficult to understand  I am concerned that as a venture capital backed project  they will not be able to resist the temptation to print their own money if   when there s a big market for it I think your theory about Bitcoin  when block rewards are gone  is valid for retail users  but if it becomes a settlement system for big institutions then the fee system should work  That said  it does seem like there is probably a more energy efficient way to do this Solana s price action has been quite curious the last few days  It seemed to become uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market on Monday  It makes me wonder if they have hired a promoter to create interest by driving up the price  This was common practice in the early days of the stock market if the book  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator  is to be believed
2021-02-25,17.23018337,17.69544462,13.79591349,Yeah really try to avoid buying on the way up  but in an accumulation stage  ie sideways  so look for coins that are hovering and volume is increasing  Then sell in profit  Sol will bounce back but will still hover between the moving average    I buy in stages at various levels  Don t time the market  Also I learnt to avoid technical analyses  etc   I just stare at the binance charts and try to understand the tech industry nees  Btw I am picking reef for my moon coin

2021-02-27,13.60157446,14.6120646,13.0572728,Nice  indeed  Makes you wary of the fact that many PoS networks  not necessarily this one in particular  could in fact be ponzi schemes  I highly doubt slashing balances this out as I feel it s more of a deterrent than something large validators would actually risk happening   I ve heard of something called 100  slashing but I m not sure if any chains are actually doing that at the moment    Makes you extra wary when these slashed tokens go to a  treasury   Even if this treasury is supposedly guarded by the network  it s very possible that there are multiple corrupt validators set up by the founders  feigning decentralisation but with sufficient collective voting power to do whatever they want
2021-03-02,14.96684488,15.22412493,13.46074941,Raydium is defi on sol  check it out
2021-03-03,13.96353988,14.72935857,13.76704854,There is some info about the transaction fees I reference here  https   docs solana com implemented proposals ed_overview ed_overviewIt says a portion is burned and the rest to the leader  which of course is chosen by a semi random lottery where  you have more of a chance of being leader based on your staked amount  at least as I understand it  Now I m sure those fees are small  but I ve also seen that someone with a 3950x and a 3080 was averaging 250k TPS on the testnet  https   forums solana com t results individual time trial benchmark performance testing 789   so I think the question is how many times are you gonna be chosen leader  and how many transactions might you process  At least for someone who doesn t have anywhere near that amount of SOL and can t reasonably expect to ever attract that type of stake  at least initially
2021-03-04,14.09486709,14.26036093,12.77126993,Exactly why it is so terrible
2021-03-07,13.04392705,13.99690288,12.72638542,Are there any outgoing tx  Or is it literally just non existent
2021-03-08,13.8268153,13.87082582,13.08228903,they suspended it again a few hours ago i managed to send a tiny test withdrawal  and it was successful  but now its disabled again

2021-03-12,16.02091887,16.48579592,14.11122934,It s just sha256 in a loop  Current output is the next input  Quantum computing is 20 years away still  which basically means it s theoretical at this point and there is no point in worrying about it  There is quantum resistant cryptography in development   and it s easy to switch once there is some industry adoption
2021-03-13,14.56380277,15.39439844,13.92005572,When you say it like that Sol is good

2021-03-15,14.47712718,14.79047269,13.69805655,how about  Cosmos chains  Binance  Terra  Secret  are among the most performant live deployments  Eth 2 0 is an ambitious vision for the future
2021-03-16,14.16391157,14.28289603,13.229815,I am excited too for people to fill out mock brackets like the NCAA does in office pools et c and bet on those
2021-03-17,13.634964,14.26679703,13.13052874,Is that number accurate  Only 10k defi users  Where do you find that metric
2021-03-27,14.78624602,16.80416436,14.75804617,Yeah  I would assume they are more focused on building right now  Once The infrastructure has been developed to a point they are satisfied with  they will probably open the floodgates with marketing

2021-04-02,19.08463141,19.82457274,18.568419,Well bro the thing about Solana is that is slightly new but there are a ton of resources money wise to build on Solana and many devs joining in with sick projects under construction  Like MAPS an app like Google maps for traveling where u can have money  lend  borrow change currencies  Will be huge since the app is already huge  Also Raydium  RAY is currently so small where u can swap tokens also stake and do yield farming of different pairs  Solana will be huge man  It has the hard part done which is an insanely fast blockchain that only gets faster so any application built on it will also be lightning fast
2021-04-03,19.79645158,23.827189,19.78944967,There is still a fee involved  It still is a transaction  Not sure what the confusion is
2021-04-04,22.52737075,25.56953325,22.21296864,Very true  However there is work being done to have transistors built on an atomic level Then you got quantum computers on the subatomic level but we are way aways from that
2021-04-05,23.92883933,24.7776371,22.80645173,And I guess  account balances  right

2021-04-23,38.89918232,41.46325941,31.66427002,I happen to like the look and Ive noticed a lot of crypto projects have dark mode on their sites  so it should be familiar in a way to a lot of people  But yes  SPL support is a huge plus for FTX  Sending ERC20 tokens to a Solana wallet as SPL tokens also does not incur ETH gas fees as well which is awesome  If you wanted to farm the ETH RAY pool for instance  send your ETH from FTX to your Solana wallet and you re good to go  while avoiding ridiculous Ethereum gas fees

2021-06-15,40.53583999,41.75867325,39.43581269,First of all  the vc s are not  turning around and investing money into Solana   The Solana foundation is selling their SOL for cash which they can then use to grow the ecosystem and improve the tech  Now  as to why they would do this instead of selling to the greater market at market value  there are 2 reasons  First  it doesn t dilute the market  When you have private sales to vc s  the lockup periods as well as the off the books nature of the sale mean that there is virtually no market effect  And second  it s good publicity to hear that there are very rich  intelligent people investing in your project  To clarify  I m not saying that I agree with their reasoning  I m just explaining what it probably is

2021-06-26,28.60789755,30.00703599,26.71081442,Yeah you should ve swapped to USDC first  Most likely the liquidity pool for STEP RAY is really small so the conversion rate for the AMM was not true market  In general it s best to swap to USDC first for most coins  You can swap between SOL and RAY as well since the liquidity pool for that one is large too
2021-06-27,29.75264012,31.92939059,29.27119729,I feel like there needs to be a bit more explanation as to what is going on  very long error messages that don t have much explanation for example   It just feels like I m sending my money into a blackbox with a UI that feels very unpolished and transactions information processing that takes uncomfortably long when handling my money  Maybe people who are more familiar with crypto feel less uneasy about it all though
